 abstract = {Abstract  This paper presents basic demographic parameters of African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ) living in and around Amboseli National Park, Kenya. The study was conducted from 1972 to the present and results are based on the histories of 1778 individually known elephants. From 1972 to 1978, the Amboseli elephant population declined and then increased steadily from 1979 to the present. Births occurred throughout the year but over 80% occurred between November and May. Birth rate varied from year to year with a pattern of peaks and troughs at 4‐ to 5‐year intervals. The birth sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1. Mean age at first birth was 14.1 years, determined from a sample of 546 known‐age females. Mean birth interval ( n = 732) was 4.5 years for 255 females. Fecundity and calf survival varied by age of the females. Mortality fluctuated from year to year. Sex‐specific mortality rates were consistently higher for males than females at all ages. },

 abstract = {Children struggling with the effects of trauma in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) face a substantial mental health resource gap that limits their opportunities for positive psychosocial development. Multidisciplinary interventions working to close this gap may benefit from incorporating an empirically supported treatment (EST) into their approach that targets a universal mechanism implicated in resilience, like attachment. ESTs should be selected based on their level of empirical support and cultural adaptability, and then modified on the basis of qualitative evaluations conducted with the local population and stakeholders. This paper will provide an overview of attachment as a mechanism of resilience, a critical analysis of existing attachment-based ESTs, and recommendations for overcoming EST implementation barriers in LMIC.},

 abstract = {Classic life-history theory predicts that menopause should not occur because there should be no selection for survival after the cessation of reproduction [1]. Yet, human females routinely live 30 years after they have stopped reproducing [2]. Only two other species-killer whales (Orcinus orca) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) [3, 4]-have comparable postreproductive lifespans. In theory, menopause can evolve via inclusive fitness benefits [5, 6], but the mechanisms by which postreproductive females help their kin remain enigmatic. One hypothesis is that postreproductive females act as repositories of ecological knowledge and thereby buffer kin against environmental hardships [7, 8]. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales. We show three key results. First, postreproductively aged females lead groups during collective movement in salmon foraging grounds. Second, leadership by postreproductively aged females is especially prominent in difficult years when salmon abundance is low. This finding is critical because salmon abundance drives both mortality and reproductive success in resident killer whales [9, 10]. Third, females are more likely to lead their sons than they are to lead their daughters, supporting predictions of recent models [5] of the evolution of menopause based on kinship dynamics. Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female resident killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing. },

 abstract = {Abstract Two experiments tested the hypothesis that the accessibility of disease concerns would be associated with a preference for faces high in symmetry, a cue to good health and pathogen resistance. Disease concerns (perceived vulnerability to disease) were measured as an individual difference in Experiment 1 and were situationally primed in Experiment 2. Across both studies, heightened disease sensitivity predicted a preference for symmetrical faces. Importantly, this increased preference for symmetrical faces when disease threats were salient did not generalize to non‐face stimuli. These results suggest a domain‐specific preference for symmetry in human faces, an adaptive response due to the ability of faces to signal resistance to infectious diseases in individuals and situations where disease is a salient threat.

Building on existing theory nested in the paradigm of pure sociology, we propose and test a general principle of conflict: Victim injury varies directly with social distance. This principle predicts that offenders are more likely to harm victims with whom they are less well acquainted and less similar culturally. We test three hypotheses derived from this principle with data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and find little support for the theory. Rather, findings suggest exactly the opposite of that predicted: As social distance between offender and victim increases, the odds of victim injury decreases.

Evolutionary educational psychology is the study of how an evolved bias in children's learning and motivational systems influences their ability and motivation to learn evolutionarily novel academic abilities and information in school. I provide an overview of evolved domains of mind, corresponding learning and motivational biases, and the evolved systems that allow humans to learn about and cope with variation and change within lifetimes. The latter enable the creation of cultural and academic innovations and support the learning of evolutionarily novel information in school.

 abstract = {With technological advances in culture-independent molecular methods, we are uncovering a new facet of our natural history by accounting for the vast diversity of microbial life which colonizes the human body. The human microbiome contributes functional genes and metabolites which affect human physiology and are, therefore, considered an important factor for maintaining health. Much has been described in the past decade based primarily on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing regarding the diversity, structure, stability and dynamics of human microbiota in their various body habitats, most notably within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Relatively high levels of variation have been described across different stages of life and geographical locations for the GIT microbiome. These observations may prove helpful for the future contextualization of patterns in other body habitats especially in relation to identifying generalizable trends over human lifetime. Given the large degree of complexity and variability, a key challenge will be how to define baseline healthy microbiomes and how to identify features which reflect deviations therefrom in the future. In this context, metagenomics and functional omics will likely play a central role as they will allow resolution of microbiome-conferred functionalities associated with health. Such information will be vital for formulating therapeutic interventions aimed at managing microbiota-mediated health particularly in the GIT over the course of a human lifetime.},

For this analysis, we considered extant utility models, along with new indices that we created using data from the literature. Relationships with overall food utility are generally weak in the sample, which means that alternative utility models are necessary for explaining skeletal patterns in the assemblages. Moreover, contrary to our expectation, differences between shelter and open air assemblages are not pronounced. Lastly, our study indicates that density-mediated attrition and the type of measure used to estimate skeletal abundances can substantially influence correlations with the utility models.},

 abstract = {We examined the question of whether the occurrence of menopause in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) females approximates that found in women from a life history standpoint. We used data from two provisioned free-ranging populations of rhesus macaques to estimate the probability that a juvenile female not only will survive to the potentially postmenopausal age of 25 years but also will cease to experience menstrual cycles between 25 and 27 years. We used the same data to assess whether an age-related deterioration in body condition can predict whether females ≥25 years old will be acyclic. Our analyses indicate that, within our study populations, (1) ≤1 in every 10 juvenile females can be expected eventually to undergo the climacteric, and (2) being in poor condition is strongly associated with being acyclic in old age. Current theory regarding the evolution of senescence in species that do not reproduce by binary fission posits that aging is a consequence of the force of natural selection declining with age. Inasmuch as the proportion of female rhesus macaque juveniles that ultimately experience menopause is small, and inasmuch as reproductive senescence does not appear to outpace organismal aging in general (as indexed by an age-related decline in body condition), we conclude that the occurrence of menopause in rhesus females is parsimoniously explained by the general evolutionary theory of aging and that the invocation of a special adaptive explanation, such as the grandmother hypothesis or a variant thereof, is unnecessary.},

Molecules of DNA can, therefore, shed light on how busy this crossroads was during the past millennia. Unfortunately, Yemeni populations have been neglected in genetic literature until recently. However, from the genetic point of view, there are several important questions that cannot be addressed without detailed genetic data. Do the present-day populations of southern Arabia contain genetic traces testifying to the first migration Out-of-Africa? Can such traces survive until today? What subsequent population movements may have affected the Yemeni gene pool? What is the proportion of more ancient (Pleistocene) and more recent (Holocene) population impacts to its genetic diversity? Did the specific geographic position of Yemen influence the genetic structure of its population?This chapter provides a review of published mitochondrial DNA data from Yemeni populations within the archaeological and paleoclimatological context.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining body image from a cross-cultural perspective have tended to neglect samples from different ethnic groups or along a rural-urban continuum. To overcome this limitation, the present study examined positive body image among rural and urban women from three major indigenous ethnic groups in Sabah, Malaysia.
METHOD: A total of 202 women completed the Body Appreciation Scale, as well as measures of media exposure and financial security, and provided their demographic details.
RESULTS: 
RESULT: s showed that there were significant rural-urban differences in body appreciation, with rural participants having significantly higher body appreciation than urban participants. A comparison with a previous data set of West Malaysian women (Swami & Chamorro-Premuzic, 2008) showed that the current urban sample had significantly lower body appreciation and that the rural group had significantly higher body appreciation. Further results showed that research site (urban vs rural) explained 11.0% of the variance in body appreciation. Participant body mass index and exposure to western forms of media explained an additional 2.0% of the variance.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there are differences in body image between rural and urban women. Results are discussed in relation to the promotion of positive body image, particularly in developing societies where health care resources may be limited.},

 abstract = {The late Pleistocene and Holocene history of eastern Africa is complex and major gaps remain in our understanding of human occupation during this period. Questions concerning the identities, geographical distributions and chronologies of foraging, herding and agricultural populations — often problematically equated with the chronological labels ‘Later Stone Age (LSA)’, ‘Neolithic’ and ‘Iron Age’ — are still unresolved. Previous studies at the site of Kuumbi Cave in the Zanzibar Archipelago of Tanzania reported late Pleistocene Middle Stone Age (MSA) and LSA, mid-Holocene Neolithic and late Holocene Iron Age occupations (Sinclair et al. 2006; Chami 2009). Kuumbi Cave considerably extends the chronology of human occupation on the eastern African coast and findings from the site have been the basis for the somewhat contentious identification of both a coastal Neolithic culture and early chicken, a domesticate that was introduced to Africa from Asia. The site therefore warrants further investigation. Here we report on a new excavation of the Kuumbi Cave sequence that has produced a suite of 20 radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. Our results suggest that the cave’s stratigraphy is complex, reflecting taphonomic processes that present interpretive and dating challenges. Our assessment of the stratigraphic sequence demonstrates three phases of habitation, two of which reflect terminal Pleistocene occupation and are characterised by quartz microliths, bone points and the exploitation of terrestrial and marine species, and one of which reflects later reoccupation by AD 600. In this latter phase, Kuumbi Cave was inhabited by a population with a locally distinct material culture that included idiosyncratic Tana or Triangular Incised Ware ceramics and medium-sized limestone stone tools, but with a subsistence economy similar to that of the late Pleistocene, albeit with more emphasis on marine foods and smaller terrestrial mammals. Our results suggest that Kuumbi Cave may have been unoccupied for much of the Holocene, after Zanzibar became an island. Our findings also place into question earlier identifications of domesticates, Asian fauna and a mid-Holocene Neolithic culture at the site.},

 abstract = {Teen motherhood is the prevalent childbearing pattern in most traditional populations. Yet early motherhood is associated with negative biological and social outcomes in the developed world. We review the teen pregnancy literature in light of this discrepancy, emphasizing two core debates. The first debate centers on whether teens have poor pregnancy outcomes compared to older women, and whether negative outcomes are biologically based. Second, we consider the debate over the confounding effects of socio-economic conditions associated with being young. When teens are considered as a group, results are inconsistent across studies. When teens are disaggregated by age, the strongest finding across studies is that biological risk is concentrated in only the youngest of mothers. Negative consequences are associated with teen motherhood not because of chronological age per se, but because of relative developmental maturity and the availability of non-maternal support. In most traditional societies as well as in some sectors of developed societies, teen motherhood occurs within the context of extended kin networks and is subsidized through reliable economic and childcare assistance. Child-rearing practices, rather than pregnancy per se, may explain much of the discrepancy in the prevalence, success and attitudes toward teen motherhood in traditional and developed societies.},

Although the microbiome of both groups is compositionally similar, hunter-gatherers harbor increased abundance of Prevotellaceae, Treponema, and Clostridiaceae, while the Bantu gut microbiome is dominated by Firmicutes. Comparisons with US Americans reveal microbiome differences between Africans and westerners but show western-like features in the Bantu, including an increased abundance of predictive carbohydrate and xenobiotic metabolic pathways. In contrast, the hunter-gatherer gut shows increased abundance of predicted virulence, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism functions, as well as dominance of lipid and amino-acid-derived metabolites, as determined through metabolomics. Our results demonstrate gradients of traditional subsistence patterns in two neighboring African groups and highlight the adaptability of the microbiome in response to host ecology. },

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This work aims to consider how the discipline of anthropology contributes to the study of menopause through evolutionary, developmental, and comparative perspectives.
METHODS: This study was a review of skeletal and ethnographic evidence for menopause and postreproductive life in humans' distant past, hypotheses for the evolution of menopause and long postreproductive life, variation in age at menopause with focus on childhood environments, and the study of variation in symptom experience across populations.
RESULTS: Longevity, rather than capacity for menopause, sets humans apart from other primates. Skeletal evidence demonstrates that some Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens lived to the age at menopause and that at least one third of women in traditional foraging populations live beyond menopause. The evolutionary reasons for why women experience a long postreproductive life continue to be debated. A developmental perspective suggests that early childhood may be a critical time for the environment to irreversibly influence the number of oocytes or rate of follicular atresia and, ultimately, age at menopause. A comparative perspective examines symptom experience at midlife through participant observation, qualitative interviews, and quantitative instruments to gain a holistic understanding of the meaning, experience, and sociocultural context of menopause.
CONCLUSIONS: An evolutionary perspective suggests that menopause is not a recent phenomenon among humans. A developmental perspective focuses on the influence of early childhood on ovarian function. A comparative perspective expands clinical norms and provides knowledge about the range of human variations.},

 abstract = {Antioxidants are beneficial compounds found in a lot of foods. Cordia africana (Lam.) is a small fruit eaten all over Tigray and other parts of Ethiopia. The fruit was tested for its antioxidant content using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and total phenols (TP) measured with Folin Ciocalteu`s reagent, across four different agroecological zones and three land use classes in Tigray. The average FRAP value on dry weight basis was 30.8 ± 1.45 mg Trolox equivalent 100 g-1 fruit, and the average TP value on dry weight basis 2317.0 ± 104.0 mg gallic acid equivalent 100 g-1 fruit. Both FRAP and TP values were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) different across the agroecology with the lower altitude agroecology giving the highest value and the dry mid altitude agroecology giving the least value. The difference in land use showed no effect on the FRAP value; however the TP values were significantly (p < 0.01) different across the different land use. The highest value of TP was found in the wild and the lowest was found in the backyard land uses. C. africana is a fruit with good quantities of TP, and small amounts of antioxidants measured with FRAP. Both FRAP and TP values showed variation across agroecology, while only the TP content vary across land use. The fruit was also found to have 9.07 mg 100 g -1 fruit, which makes it a good source of the vitamin to meet part of the daily requirement. As antioxidants and vitamin C are highly beneficial to general health, the consumption of this fruit should thus be recommended and promoted. Key words: Cordia africana fruit, ferric reducing antioxidant power, total phenol, agroecology, land use.},

All positive sera were positive by both direct agglutination and indirect immunofluorescence tests and were confirmed by the dye test. The seropositivity was confirmed by immunoblotting showing a distinct 32 kDa band in all the seropositive samples. The seropositivity rate was 4% (19/450) among the subjects of Nyamisati origin and 47% (15/32) among immigrants from other areas of Tanzania. Most of the infections appeared to have occurred between 5 and 15 years of age. The generally low transmission in this mainly Muslim village appeared to be related to sparse consumption of contaminated food and low prevalence of oocysts due to scarcity of felines.},

 abstract = {In many animals, males contribute substantially to caring for their young but also have the opportunity to enhance their reproductive success by attracting additional mates or by seeking copulations with females that are already paired to other males. Sometimes, the opportunity to gain these additional matings coincides with periods when males are providing parental care. At such times, males might be expected to allocate time and effort to these alternative behaviours in a way that maximizes their overall reproductive success. But do they? Here, we examine the recent evidence for a tradeoff between parental effort and additional mating effort and highlight some of the factors that might influence how this conflict is resolved. We conclude that, in spite of the paucity of comprehensive studies, this tradeoff has a potentially important and often overlooked influence on parental behaviour in a range of taxa.},

 abstract = {Nowadays there are more than 300 hypotheses to explain ageing characteristics, function and mechanisms, possibly due to the large and increasing number of old people in the world. Though having a social function attributed to elders, transformations - under way currently in society - have imposed a discard culture, including old people. This is an authentic exclusion that is frequently associated with sadness, depression and death in its group, contradicting the alleged idea that older people increase life-time (as has been observed in recent years). This manuscript has the aim of determining environmental aspects involved with longevity; it thus uses "grounded theory", a technique of qualitative research method, operating on data provided by elderly former railroad workers. It was observed that former railroad worker's social representations convey to a central category: desolation from perceiving life and environmental annihilation due to continuous State and Society negligence to promote and preserve good things - that existed in the past. We can also observe that, in a parallel way, by hyper valorizing past things, they recognize their existence as part of an epic process that promoted the São Paulo state countryside economic and social development, with an existential meaning to the past, which suggests to be a strong defense mechanism that contributes to longevity. This finding can be included in the hypothesis that the function of longevity would be to preserve a social contingent with knowledge about a way of life that was successful because it was socially advantageous.},

 abstract = {Human menopause is remarkable in that reproductive senescence is markedly accelerated relative to somatic aging, leaving an extended postreproductive period for a large proportion of women. Functional explanations for this are debated, in part because comparative data from closely related species are inadequate. Existing studies of chimpanzees are based on very small samples and have not provided clear conclusions about the reproductive function of aging females. These studies have not examined whether reproductive senescence in chimpanzees exceeds the pace of general aging, as in humans, or occurs in parallel with declines in overall health, as in many other animals. In order to remedy these problems, we examined fertility and mortality patterns in six free-living chimpanzee populations. Chimpanzee and human birth rates show similar patterns of decline beginning in the fourth decade, suggesting that the physiology of reproductive senescence was relatively conserved in human evolution. However, in contrast to humans, chimpanzee fertility declines are consistent with declines in survivorship, and healthy females maintain high birth rates late into life. Thus, in contrast to recent claims, we find no evidence that menopause is a typical characteristic of chimpanzee life histories.},

 abstract = {Why do we age? Since ageing is a near-universal feature of complex organisms, a convincing theory must provide a robust evolutionary explanation for its ubiquity. This theory should be compatible with the physiological evidence that ageing is largely due to deterioration, which is, in principle, reversible through repair. Moreover, this theory should also explain why natural selection has favoured organisms that first improve with age (mortality rates decrease) and then deteriorate with age (mortality rates rise). We present a candidate for such a theory of life history, applied initially to a species with determinate growth. The model features both the quantity and the quality of somatic capital, where it is optimal to initially build up quantity, but to allow quality to deteriorate. The main theoretical result of the paper is that a life history where mortality decreases early in life and then increases late in life is evolutionarily optimal. In order to apply the model to humans, in particular, we include a budget constraint to allow intergenerational transfers. The resultant theory then accounts for all our basic demographic characteristics, including menopause with extended survival after reproduction has ceased.},

 abstract = {Understanding "how the bowel microbiota got to be the way it is" requires us to think about how microbial communities are formed. The origin of the bacterial species that colonize the infant bowel after birth is often said to be the maternal birth canal. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are "fertilizers" that promote bifidobacterial growth. This results in the microbiota of simple composition detected in studies of the fecal microbiota of infants during the first months of life. Other bacteria commonly present include members of the genus Bacteroides, which also metabolize HMOs, but presumably less efficiently than bifidobacteria. It seems that enrichment of particular kinds of bacteria in the bowel drives the phylogenetic individualism of microbiotas. The underpinning mechanisms of these enrichments evidently include the plasticity of the microbiota succession during weaning, variable dietary preferences thereafter, and idiosyncrasy in physiology.},

Most hunting is assumed to have taken place in groups, using spears of varying complexity. Recent data suggest that various meat-acquisition techniques were used, at least within the last 65 ka. Bow-and-arrow sets as well as snares appear to have complemented spear hunting. Many archaeologists have devoted a great deal of time to the study of lithic technologies required for the creation of spearheads and arrow tips. Rarely, however, have the cognitive correlates of Middle Stone Age meat-acquisition technologies been considered. Here we show that the mental concepts behind the meat-acquisition strategies are equally, or perhaps, more important than the technological complexity involved in manufacturing the necessary equipment. Notwithstanding this claim, it is also true that the longer the chain of operations involved in making composite weapons, the more likely it is that complex cognition was a prerequisite.},

Using distant out-groups, such as chimpanzees, and human populations with unique lifestyles, such as Amerindians, the history and formation of the modern human microbiome in Westernized societies can be elucidated, providing vital information into how to these microbial communities were impacted by past events. Large cultural and dietary revolutions, such as the Neolithic Revolution (~7500 years ago) and the Industrial Revolution (~200 years ago), largely impacted these microbial communities. Ancient events, such as interbreeding and admixture with our closest ancient relatives, such as Neanderthals or Denisovans, could also have impacted the microbiome that modern humans carry today.

 abstract = {It has been suggested that a high pre-conceptual waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a good predictor of male offspring and, thus, in cultures that value male children, an androgenous body shape may be judged as most attractive. The predictive value of WHRs is based on studies measuring women who already have children and correlating their WHRs with the proportion of existing male offspring. However, carrying a male child may alter WHRs in a different way to carrying a female child, and a high WHR may be an effect rather than a cause of male offspring. In order to test the predictive power of a pre-conceptual WHR and offspring gender, we took WHR measures from 458 women who intended to become pregnant and then correlated this with the genders of their subsequent children. We found no significant correlation. It is therefore not clear why a high WHR is preferred in some cultures. We suggest that differences in attractiveness preferences between different ethic groups are actually based on weight scaled for height (the body mass index or BMI) rather than the WHR since although there will be a preferred optimal BMI for each ethnic group, which will balance environmental and health factors, this optimal BMI may differ between groups and environments.},

We reexamine the measurement data on these American beauty icons and show that these reports are false in several ways. First, the variation in waist-to-hip ratios among these women is greater than reported. Second, the center of the distribution of waist-to-hip ratios is not 0.70, but less than this. Third, the average waist-to-hip ratio within both samples has changed over time in a manner that is statistically significant and can be regarded as mutually consistent. Taken together, the findings undermine some of the evidence given for the repeated suggestion that there is something special--evolutionarily hard-wired or otherwise--about a specific female waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 as a preference of American heterosexual males.},

 abstract = {Ethnic variations in red blood cell (RBC) antigens can be a source of alloimmunization, especially in migrant populations. To improve transfusion safety in continental Africa and countries with African migrants, we performed RBC genotyping to determine allele frequencies coding for high- and low-prevalence antigens. A total of 481 blood samples were collected in ethnic groups from West, Central and East Africa. Molecular typing was performed using a polymerase chain reaction - reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide method. Results demonstrated no DI*1, DI*3, YT*2, SC*2, LW*7, KN*2 alleles in any sample and the CO*2 allele was rare. The frequency of LU*1 was comparable to that of European-Caucasians (2%) except in Biaka pygmies (8%). The frequency of CROM*-1 was high in Mbuti pygmies (13%). High frequency of KN*7 and KN*6 may reflect selection pressure in the countries investigated. Analysis of Dombrock allele patterns confirmed uneven distribution of the DO*1 and DO*2 alleles with high frequencies of DO*-4 and DO*-5 in all groups. Altogether, findings demonstrated extensive allele-frequency heterogeneity across Africa and suggested that knowledge of patient ethnicity gives information about the high-prevalence antigens that may be lacking. These data are medically useful to support transfusion care of African migrants living in countries where the majority of the population is from a different ethnical background.},

Most often such biases involve comparative life expectancy, potential genetic change since agriculture, the heterogeneity of ancestral environments, and/or innate human adaptability. This paper examines these topics and attempts to show that none of them justifies a priori dismissal of the evolutionary approach to preventive medicine. Evolutionary health promotion may ultimately be invalidated because of its falsification by experiment or because another theory accords better with known facts, but these commonly held prejudices should not forestall its thoughtful consideration and investigative evaluation.},

In this study, I describe three general principles of cooperation and how they operate across systems including human sharing, cooperation in animal and insect societies and the massively large-scale cooperation that occurs in our multicellular bodies. The first principle is that of Walk Away: that cooperation is enhanced when individuals can leave uncooperative partners. The second principle is that resource sharing is often based on the need of the recipient (i.e., need-based transfers) rather than on strict account-keeping. And the last principle is that effective scaling up of cooperation requires increasingly sophisticated and costly cheater suppression mechanisms. By comparing how these principles operate across systems, we can better understand the constraints on cooperation. This can facilitate the discovery of novel ways to enhance cooperation and suppress cheating in its many forms, from social exploitation to cancer.},

The results show a clear reduction in levels of sex dimorphism in the migrants as compared to both the sedentes and the Hawaii-born. Upon finding that the migrant females were generally larger than those of the other two groups, and after reviewing certain sociocultural phenomena related to the migration, it is hypothesized that the reduction in sex dimorphism was a transient change brought about by preferential choice of mates by the male migrants.},

 abstract = {Based on ethnographic accounts from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, functional areas have been identified within Fueginian shell middens. In this context, archaeological microfacies acquire a functional meaning when the microscopic record is compared to information gathered from ethnology, macroscopic observations made during excavation, and experimental modern analogues. All these lines of evidence were combined for the first time at Tunel VII, an eighteenth/nineteenth century shell midden occupied repeatedly by Yamana people, the last hunter–gatherer–fisher groups of the Beagle Channel. The sampling strategy involved three sets of samples: (1) two stratigraphical columns taken from the hut “entrance” and from a portion of the shell midden (i.e., the surrounding refuse shell ring), (2) thin sections from five hearths representing successive phases of frequentation of the hut, and (3) experimental burnt valves of Mytilus edulis, the main malacological component of the site. Comparison of microfacies from groups (1) and (2) provided microscopic indicators to distinguish between shell dumping areas and occupation surfaces. Comparison of microfacies within columns from group (1) allowed recognizing periods of site abandonment and periods of more intense/longer site frequentation. The experimental samples from M. edulis served as a reference to characterize the five central hearths in terms of maximum burning temperatures reached. Different burning structures were correlated to the season of hut frequentation and to their location (and function) within different portions of the hut. The intra-site micromorphological comparison strategy within a well-documented ethnohistorical context provides valuable indicators for the identification of functional areas in archaeological contexts when ethnographical information is not available.},

 abstract = {Modulating natural killer cell functions in human immunity and reproduction are diverse interactions between the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) of Natural Killer (NK) cells and HLA class I ligands on the surface of tissue cells. Dominant interactions are between KIR2DL1 and the C2 epitope of HLA-C and between KIR2DL2/3 and the C1 epitope of HLA-C. KhoeSan hunter-gatherers of Southern Africa represent the earliest population divergence known and are the most genetically diverse indigenous people, qualities reflected in their KIR and HLA genes. Of the ten KhoeSan KIR2DL1 alleles, KIR2DL1*022 and KIR2DL1*026 likely originated in the KhoeSan, and later were transmitted at low frequency to the neighboring Zulus through gene flow. These alleles arose by point mutation from other KhoeSan KIR2DL1 alleles that are more widespread globally. Mutation of KIR2DL1*001 gave rise to KIR2DL1*022, causing loss of C2 recognition and gain of C1 recognition. This makes KIR2DL1*022 a more avid and specific C1 receptor than any KIR2DL2/3 allotype. Mutation of KIR2DL1*012 gave rise to KIR2DL1*026, causing premature termination of translation at the end of the transmembrane domain. This makes KIR2DL1*026 a membrane-associated receptor that lacks both a cytoplasmic tail and signaling function. At higher frequencies than their parental allotypes, the combined effect of the KhoeSan-specific KIR2DL1*022 and KIR2DL1*026 is to reduce the frequency of strong inhibitory C2 receptors and increase the frequency of strong inhibitory C1 receptors. Because interaction of KIR2DL1 with C2 is associated with risk of pregnancy disorder, these functional changes are potentially advantageous. Whereas all other KhoeSan KIR2DL1 alleles are present on a wide diversity of centromeric KIR haplotypes, KIR2DL1*026 is present on a single KIR haplotype and KIR2DL1*022 is present on two very similar haplotypes. The high linkage disequilibrium across their haplotypes is consistent with a recent emergence for these KIR2DL1 alleles that have distinctive functions. },

Archaeological estimation of the weaning process is generally at the level of an entire burial population, creating some challenges in using such data to test anthropological theory. We describe a method that tracks the weaning process at the individual level, based on the measurement of stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in serial sections of first molar dentin collagen. We apply this micro-sampling technique to a sample of individuals from CA-CCO-548, a well-studied and ancient site on the banks of Marsh Creek in Central California. Results show great variation between individuals in both the length of the weaning process, the age at which breastfeeding stopped, and the source of early complementary childhood foods.},

Even those scientists working in recent phases of human evolution, when modern humans evolved, agree that hunter-gatherer adaptations are tied to the way that climate and environment shape the food and technological resource base. The result is a long tradition of paleoanthropologists engaging with climate and environmental scientists in an effort to understand if and how hominin bio-behavioral evolution responded to climate and environmental change. Despite this unusual consonance, the anticipated rewards of this synergy are unrealized and, in our opinion, will not reach potential until there are some fundamental changes in the way the research model is constructed. Discovering the relation between climate and environmental change to human origins must be grounded in a theoretical framework and a causal understanding of the connection between climate, environment, resource patterning, behavior, and morphology, then move beyond the strict correlative research that continues to dominate the field. },

In all other primate species the vast majority of females continue to reproduce until the end of their lives. There are three possible explanations for the perplexing evolution of reproductive cessation long before the end of the lifespan: the antagonistic pleiotropy or trade‐off hypothesis; the physiological constraint hypothesis; and the grandmother hypothesis. That the mammalian female reproductive system might be physiologically constrained to function for only fifty to fifty‐two years, despite the evolution of much longer lifespan in humans, is quite likely. However there is also some evidence that nonreproductive human grandmothers can improve the fitness of descendants by provisioning them with food—a situation that is simply too rare in nonhuman primates to have favored the evolution of menopause.},

While historically studied by researching the brain, inputs from the periphery impact many neurological conditions. Indeed, emerging data suggest communication between the gut and the brain in anxiety, depression, cognition, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The development of a healthy, functional brain depends on key pre- and post-natal events that integrate environmental cues, such as molecular signals from the gut. These cues largely originate from the microbiome, the consortium of symbiotic bacteria that reside within all animals. Research over the past few years reveals that the gut microbiome plays a role in basic neurogenerative processes such as the formation of the blood-brain barrier, myelination, neurogenesis, and microglia maturation and also modulates many aspects of animal behavior. Herein, we discuss the biological intersection of neurodevelopment and the microbiome and explore the hypothesis that gut bacteria are integral contributors to development and function of the nervous system and to the balance between mental health and disease.},

This is principally because the features of hunter-gatherer societies have been associated with discussions about the nature of human child rearing. However, few studies have empirically analyzed the education and learning that actually occur during the everyday life of the San. To reconsider several of the premises underpinning most approaches to human education and learning, I performed an interaction analysis of the mutual accommodation that occurs while caregivers and infants engage in nursing and “gymnastic” behaviors and the process by which children imitate each other during singing/dancing activities among the G|ui and G||ana (Central Kalahari San) living in Botswana. This analysis clarifies how participants in interactions align and affiliate with each other during culturally distinctive activities. These dynamics serve as a foundation for the education and learning that is inherent in collaboratively organized sequences of interactions, by means of which experienced and inexperienced people participate in social situations, such as those listed above. The approach adopted in this paper also facilitates reconsideration of the individualistic perspectives on ability.},

Although it is clear that puberty and menarche currently begin at younger ages than they did in past centuries, a comparison of the onset of puberty during the few past decades is more difficult to interpret. African-American girls do start puberty earlier and menarche is earlier than in White girls, and the gap between the two has widened during the past 20 years. This change between ethnic groups might be due to an increasing difference in body mass index (BMI) values. Greater BMI values are associated with pubertal onset or menarche; thus, if BMI continues to increase in childhood, earlier puberty might well be found in the general population in the future. In the absence of accurate data from the past or definitive studies at present, however, it cannot be stated with assurance that puberty today starts significantly earlier than it did in the past 4-5 decades across the whole population.},

Haldane might have appreciated this emphasis on mutation and the importance of simple models for inference, but I also wonder what he might have thought about a “molecular clock” for evolutionary studies derived from counting mutations. Our discovery with mtDNA was unexpected and raises a number of questions about biological speciation and anthropological models for the origin of modern people. The ecological perspective that comes from working with endangered mammalian species, especially those having certain life-history characteristics similar to humans, also suggests some questions to be asked about social behaviors and environmental conditions that ensured the survival of our African ancestors.},

 abstract = {Acoustic stimuli are processed throughout the auditory projection pathway, including the neocortex, by neurons that are aggregated into ‘tonotopic’ maps according to their specific frequency tunings1,2,3. Research on animals has shown that tonotopic representations are not statically fixed in the adult organism but can reorganize after damage to the cochlea4 or after training the intact subject to discriminate between auditory stimuli5. Here we used functional magnetic source imaging (single dipole model) to measure cortical representations in highly skilled musicians. Dipole moments for piano tones, but not for pure tones of similar fundamental frequency (matched in loudness), were found to be enlarged by about 25% in musicians compared with control subjects who had never played an instrument. Enlargement was correlated with the age at which musicians began to practise and did not differ between musicians with absolute or relative pitch. These results, when interpreted with evidence for modified somatosensory representations of the fingering digits in skilled violinists6, suggest that use-dependent functional reorganization extends across the sensory cortices to reflect the pattern of sensory input processed by the subject during development of musical skill.},

 abstract = {AIMS:   A possible explanation for increased levels of attractiveness of faces when under the influence of alcohol is the reduced ability to perceive bilateral asymmetry. This study tested the degree of preference by alcohol-dosed and non-alcohol-dosed participants for symmetrical faces and their ability to detect facial symmetry, while controlling for other explanations.
DESIGN:   Volunteers were recruited to a random allocation experiment with three conditions: alcoholic drink (alcohol dosed), non-alcoholic drink (placebo) and diluted orange cordial (control). Data on concentration, personality and demographics were collected. Dependent variables were symmetry preference and detection.
SETTING:   Laboratory, University of Roehampton.
PARTICIPANTS:   A total of 101 participants, mainly students (41 alcohol-dosed, 40 placebo, 20 control).
MEASUREMENTS:   Participants provided verbal responses to images of faces which were presented on a computer screen for 5 seconds each; the first task required a preference judgement and the second task consisted of a forced-choice response of whether or not a face was symmetrical. Levels of concentration, weight and level of alcohol dose were measured, and demographics plus additional psychological and health information were collected using a computer-based questionnaire.
FINDINGS:   In contrast to a previous investigation, there was no difference in symmetry preference between conditions (P = 0.846). In agreement with previous findings, participants who had not drunk alcohol were better at detecting whether a face was symmetrical or asymmetrical (P = 0.043). Measures of concentration did not differ between conditions (P = 0.214-0.438). Gender did not affect ability to detect symmetry in placebo or alcohol-dosed participants (P = 0.984, 0.499); however, alcohol-dosed females were shown to demonstrate greater symmetry preference than alcohol-dosed males (P = 0.004).

 abstract = {The evolution of postmenopausal longevity in human females has been the subject of debate. Specifically, there is disagreement about whether the evolution of the trait should be understood as an adaptive or a neutral process, and if the former, what the selective mechanism is. There are two main adaptive proposals to explain the evolution of postreproductive longevity: the grandmother and the mother hypotheses. The grandmother hypothesis proposes that postreproductive longevity evolved because it is selectively advantageous for females to stop reproducing and to help raise their grandchildren. The mother hypothesis states that postmenopausal longevity evolved because it is advantageous for women to cease reproduction and concentrate their resources and energy in raising the children already produced. In this article, we test the mother and the grandmother hypotheses with a historical data set from which we bootstrapped random samples of women from different families who lived from the 1500s to the 1900s in the central valley of Costa Rica. We also compute the heritability of longevity, which allows us to determine if genes involved in longevity are nearly fixed in this population. Here we show that although longevity positively affects a woman's fertility, it negatively affects her daughter's fertility; for this reason, the heritability of longevity is unexpectedly high. Our data provide strong grounds for questioning the universality of the grandmother hypothesis and for supporting the mother hypothesis as a likely explanation for the evolution of human postreproductive longevity.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peoples' attempts to lose weight by low calorie diets often result in weight gain because of over-compensatory overeating during lapses. Animals usually respond to a change in food availability by adjusting their foraging effort and altering how much energy reserves they store. But in many situations the long-term availability of food is uncertain, so animals may attempt to estimate it to decide the appropriate level of fat storage.
METHODOLOGY: We report the results of a conceptual model of feeding in which the animal knows whether food is currently abundant or limited, but does not know the proportion of time, there will be an abundance in the long-term and has to learn it.
RESULTS: If the food supply is limited much of the time, such as during cycles of dieting attempts, the optimal response is to gain a lot of weight when food is abundant.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This implies that recurring attempts to diet, by signalling to the body that the food supply is often insufficient, will lead to a greater fat storage than if food was always abundant. Our results shed light on the widespread phenomenon of weight gain during weight cycling and indicate possible interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity.},

 abstract = {Cooking installations are among the most abundant features in Bronze and Iron Age archaeological sites in the southern Levant, yet until now their study has been mostly descriptive. We present a study of 11 purported archaeological cooking installations from three different Bronze and Iron Age sites in Israel in which we deployed a variety of microarchaeological techniques. We provide direct physical evidence, based on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrating that the archaeological installations were operated with temperatures as high as 900 °C. Using this technique we also demonstrate that all the mud-constructed installations studied by us were internally-fueled and therefore should be identified as Tannurs rather than the externally- fueled Tabuns. We studied in detail the quantities of ash-related microscopic remains, including opaline phytoliths, calcitic wood ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites. We show that phytolith morphotype analysis cannot distinguish between wood-dominated and dung-dominated fuel materials, while a newly developed method that calculates the ratio of ash pseudomorphs to dung spherulites (PSR method) makes such a distinction possible. Moreover, we experimented with the effect of partial dissolution on fuel ash PSR values and utilize the results to explain taphonomy and diagenesis associated with two types of archaeological cooking installations – pebble hearths and baking ovens. In addition, we identified micromorphological criteria that can be used to assess whether ash deposits in or above a cooking installations are in situ and/or disturbed. Taken together, all lines of evidence used in this study indicate that wood was the major fuel material across time and space in the studied archaeological contexts, while dung was a secondary source of fuel. This observation also cross-cuts different culture-historical entities (Philistines, Canaanites, Israelites and Egyptians). In addition, wood was preferred as fuel irrespective of environmental differences among the studied sites. This study is yet another demonstration of the value of integrating microarchaeological techniques and approaches to traditional macroscopic archaeology.},

 abstract = {The pelvis performs two major functions for terrestrial mammals. It provides somewhat rigid support for muscles engaged in locomotion and, for females, it serves as the birth canal. The result for many species, and especially for encephalized primates, is an 'obstetric dilemma' whereby the neonate often has to negotiate a tight squeeze in order to be born. On top of what was probably a baseline of challenging birth, locomotor changes in the evolution of bipedalism in the human lineage resulted in an even more complex birth process. Negotiation of the bipedal pelvis requires a series of rotations, the end of which has the infant emerging from the birth canal facing the opposite direction from the mother. This pattern, strikingly different from what is typically seen in monkeys and apes, places a premium on having assistance at delivery. Recently reported observations of births in monkeys and apes are used to compare the process in human and non-human primates, highlighting similarities and differences. These include presentation (face, occiput anterior or posterior), internal and external rotation, use of the hands by mothers and infants, reliance on assistance, and the developmental state of the neonate. },

Collagen stable nitrogen- and carbon-isotope ratios from juvenile and adult burials from four sites in eastern North America were measured to estimate weaning onsets and durations before and after the appearance of intensive food production. Two preagricultural Late Archaic sites (Indian Knoll and Carlston Annis) are compared with two highly agricultural Middle Mississippian sites (Angel and Tinsley Hill). Isotopic data and paleodemographic measures of birth rates provide no evidence for changes in weaning behavior or fertility with the development of food production in the prehistoric Lower Ohio Valley. Birth rates and weaning behavior appear to have been roughly the same at all four sites. These results indicate that models attributing population growth after the appearance of food production to earlier weaning are not universally applicable.},

 abstract = {Several authors have published about baobab food products. Data on macronutrients, micronutrients, amino acids, and fatty acids were collected from literature for pulp, leaves, seeds, and kernels of the baobab tree. The results show that baobab pulp is particularly rich in vitamin C; consumption of 40 g covers 84 to more than 100% of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of pregnant women (19-30 years). The leaves are particularly rich in calcium (307 to 2640 mg/100 g dw), and they are known to contain good quality proteins with a chemical score of 0.81. The whole seeds and the kernels have a relatively high lipid content, 11.6 to 33.3 g/100 g dw and 18.9 to 34.7 g/100 g dw, respectively. The pulp and leaves exhibit antioxidant properties with a higher activity in the pulp than in the leaves. Reported nutrient contents of different baobab parts show a large variation, which may have arisen from various factors. Three recommendations are given for future research: 1. More attention should be given to accuracy and precision of analytical methods, 2. Research about digestibility and bioavailability of baobab products is needed, 3. The effect of storage and processing on the nutritional value of baobab products needs to be assessed.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gut microbiome is critical for human health, and its alteration is associated with intestinal, autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Numerous studies have focused on prevention or treatment of dysbiotic microbiome to reduce the risk or effect of these diseases. A key issue is to define the microbiome associated with the state of good health. The purpose of this review is to describe factors influencing the gut microbiome with special emphasis on contributions from Latin America. In addition, we will highlight opportunities for future studies on gut microbiome in Latin America.
RECENT FINDINGS: A relevant factor influencing gut microbiome composition is geographical location associated with specific genetic, dietary and lifestyle factors. Geographical specificities suggest that a universal 'healthy microbiome' is unlikely.
SUMMARY: Several research programs, mostly from Europe and North America, are extensively sequencing gut microbiome of healthy people, whereas data from Latin America remain scarce yet slowly increasing. Few studies have shown difference in the composition of gut microbiome between their local populations with that of other industrialized countries (North American populations). Latin America is composed of countries with a myriad of lifestyles, traditions, genetic backgrounds and socioeconomic conditions, which may determine differences in gut microbiome of individuals from different countries. This represents an opportunity to better understand the relationship between these factors and gut microbiome.},

The population was homogeneous and distinct from other African and European populations. Single SNPs in the MYOC, COL8A2, COL1A1 and ZNF469 gene regions showed marginal associations with POAG. No association with POAG was identified with tagging SNPs in TMCO1, CAV1/CAV2, CYP1B1, COL1A2, COL5A1, CDKN2B/CDKN2BAS-1, SIX1/SIX6 or the chromosome 2p16 regions and there were no associations with CCT or VCDR. However, SNP rs12522383 in WDR36 was associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.00008). This first POAG genetic association study in black South Africans has therefore identified associations that require additional investigation in this and other populations to determine their significance. This highlights the need for larger studies in this population if we are to achieve the goal of facilitating early POAG detection and ultimately preventing irreversible blindness from this condition.},

 abstract = {Teen motherhood is the prevalent childbearing pattern in most traditional societies, as it likely was the case in the ancestral past. Yet teen pregnancy is associated with negative biological and social outcomes in the developed world. This contrast illustrates a question central to evolutionary medicine. How do adaptations to ancestral environments shape contemporary human health and behavior? Teen motherhood also exemplifies the important life history trade-off of whether to invest in current or future reproduction. Should a young teen continue to grow and mature or put her time and energy into starting a family? The age at which a young woman gives birth for the first time is ecologically sensitive to both her physical and social environment. Following an overview of the medical and social risks associated with teen pregnancy, this chapter presents a case study about the Pumé, a group of South American hunter-gatherers, to evaluate the costs and benefits of teen motherhood in a preindustrial environment. Results of demographic analyses show that the youngest of teen mothers (≤14.3 years) have increased risk of infant mortality and lower lifetime fertility compared to older teens. However, young mothers gain no fitness advantage by delaying reproduction past their mid-teens. Cross-cultural comparisons suggest that childrearing practices rather than biological risks explain much of the discrepancy between traditional and developed societies in both the success of and attitudes toward teen motherhood.},

 abstract = {Variation in central serotonin levels due to genetic mutations or experimental modifications has been associated with the manifestation of aggression in humans and animals. Many studies have examined whether common variants in serotonergic genes are implicated in aggressive or antisocial behaviors (ASB) in human samples. The two most commonly studied polymorphisms have been the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region of the serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR) and the 30 base pair variable number of tandem repeats of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA-uVNTR). Despite the aforementioned theoretical justification for these polymorphisms, findings across studies have been mixed and are thus difficult to interpret. A meta-analysis of associations of the 5HTTLPR and MAOA-uVNTR with ASB was conducted to determine: (1) the overall magnitude of effects for each polymorphism, (2) the extent of heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies and the likelihood of publication bias, and (3) whether sample-level or study-level characteristics could explain observed heterogeneity across studies. Both the 5HTTLPR and the MAOA-uVNTR were significantly associated with ASB across studies. There was also significant and substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes for both markers, but this heterogeneity was not explained by any sample-level or study-level characteristics examined. We did not find any evidence for publication bias across studies for the MAOA-uVNTR, but there was evidence for an oversampling of statistically significant effect sizes for the 5HTTLPR. These findings provide support for the modest role of common serotonergic variants in ASB. Implications regarding the role of serotonin in antisocial behavior and the conceptualization of antisocial and aggressive phenotypes are discussed.},

 abstract = { The Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi in coastal, southwestern Portugal currently represents one of the earliest known cases of grease-rendering in Eurasia, with initial occupation of the site occurring during the early Gravettian at ∼28,000 BP. Already by this time, Vale Boi foragers were intensively processing ungulate carcasses by rendering grease from their bones. Zooarchaeological evidence of grease rendering includes extensive fragmentation of red deer and equine remains, abundant evidence of impact features on specimens and a lower proportion of preserved grease-rich skeletal portions. Comparisons of red deer and horse bone portions with density assays and utility indices suggest that ungulates at Vale Boi were systematically processed for their marrow and bone grease. The early onset of grease-rendering at Vale Boi, in addition to heavy rabbit exploitation may have been spurred by ungulate communities unable to support human consumer-demand on their own. However, the continued practice of grease-rendering at Vale Boi over the course of the Upper Paleolithic may also be closely related to the significance of bone fats for mobile hunter–gatherers – as a highly valued, storable and easily-transportable resource.},

 abstract = {Lifetime reproductive effort (LRE) measures the total amount of metabolized energy diverted to reproduction during the lifespan. LRE captures key components of the life history and is particularly useful for describing and comparing the life histories of different organisms. Given a simple energetic production constraint, LRE is predicted to be similar in value for very different life histories. However, humans have some unique ecological characteristics that may alter LRE, such as the long post-reproductive lifespan, lengthy juvenile period and the cooperative nature of human foraging and reproduction. We calculate LRE for natural fertility human populations, compare the findings to other mammals and discuss the implications for human life-history evolution. We find that human life-history traits combine to yield the theoretically predicted value (approx. 1.4). Thus, even with the subsidized energy budget and uniqueness of the adult lifespan, human reproductive strategies converge on the same optimal value of LRE. This suggests that the fundamental demographic variables contained in LRE trade-off against one another in a predictable and highly constrained manner.},

 abstract = {N-Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is an important enzyme involved in the metabolism of a wide spectrum of naturally occurring xenobiotics, including therapeutic drugs and common environmental carcinogens. Extensive polymorphism in NAT2 gives rise to a wide interindividual variation in acetylation capacity, which influences individual susceptibility to various drug-induced adverse reactions and cancers. Striking patterns of geographic differentiation have been described for the main slow acetylation variants of the NAT2 gene, suggesting the action of natural selection at this locus. In the present study, we took advantage of whole-genome sequence data available from the 1000 Genomes project to investigate the global patterns of population genetic differentiation at NAT2 and determine whether they are atypical compared with the remaining variation of the genome. The nonsynonymous substitution c.590G>A (rs1799930) defining the slow NAT2*6 haplotype cluster exhibited an unusually low FST value compared with the genome average (FST = 0.006, P = 0.016). It was indicated as the most likely target of a homogenizing process of selection promoting the same allelic variant in globally distributed populations. The rs1799930 A allele has been associated with the slowest acetylation capacity in vivo, and its substantial correlation with the subsistence strategy adopted by past human populations suggests that it may have conferred a selective advantage in populations shifting from foraging to agricultural and pastoral activities in the Neolithic period. Results of neutrality tests further supported an adaptive evolution of the NAT2 gene through either balancing selection or directional selection acting on multiple standing slow acetylation variants.},

This chapter explores some of the strategies for growth observed in primates, and outlines potential consequences of these strategies. I do this in the context of an abundance of detailed literature on growth rates, growth constraints and models of rates of growth for humans (see for example Bogin, 1999) and non-human primates (e.g. Leigh, 1996). Models of growth can provide explanations for primate life history variation (Leigh, 1995; Dirks & Bowman, 2007) and, in addition, potentially elucidate the variation that exists at the level of the individual and population between rapid and late maturation (e.g. Wilson et al., 1983; Bercovitch & Berard, 1993; Setchell et al., 2001; Altmann & Alberts, 2005). Physical maturation is obviously a consequence of growth, but the timing of physiological or hormonal reproductive onset, rather than simply attained size, determines much of the subsequent reproductive success of the individual. Early reproduction, combined with high survival, provides significant advantages in terms of lifetime reproductive success.},

 abstract = {A compelling set of links between the composition of the gut microbiota, the host diet, and host physiology has emerged. Do these links reflect cause-and-effect relationships, and what might be their mechanistic basis? A growing body of work implicates microbially produced metabolites as crucial executors of diet-based microbial influence on the host. Here, we will review data supporting the diverse functional roles carried out by a major class of bacterial metabolites, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs can directly activate G-coupled-receptors, inhibit histone deacetylases, and serve as energy substrates. They thus affect various physiological processes and may contribute to health and disease. },

 abstract = {While attachment research has generally been situated and understood within the confines of the mother-child dyad, there is an increasing call to examine the “constellation of relational influences” on children’s attachment security (Thompson 2000:147). In addition, some attachment theorists have begun to argue that a focus on the mother-child dyad significantly decreases predictive power when examining the effects of attachment on child development (van IJzendoorn et al. 1992). These calls to incorporate other caregivers in our understanding of children’s attachments stem from a growing understanding of the extent and nature of children’s broader social relationships—specifically, that the mother-child dyad does not exist in isolation. Mothers and children are situated within large social networks and these networks affect the formation and security of children’s attachments with mothers and others (Ahnert et al. 2000; Jacobson and Frye 1991; Spieker and Bensley 1994; Tronick et al. 1992). Unfortunately, research on children’s attachments to non-maternal caregivers (Howes and Spieker 2008), and attachment in cross-cultural perspective (van IJzendoorn and Sagi 2008) is limited. There continues to be an emphasis on the mother-child dyad and research is predominately conducted in Western cultures, where mothers and children are more isolated from assistance than what is typically found throughout most of the world.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain has emerged as a factor that influences immunity, metabolism, neurodevelopment and behaviour. Cross-talk between the gut and brain begins early in life immediately following the transition from a sterile in utero environment to one that is exposed to a changing and complex microbial milieu over a lifetime. Once established, communication between the gut and brain integrates information from the autonomic and enteric nervous systems, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune signals, and peripheral immune and metabolic signals. Importantly, the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiome undergoes many transitions that parallel dynamic periods of brain development and maturation for which distinct sex differences have been identified. Here, we discuss the sexually dimorphic development, maturation and maintenance of the gut microbiome-brain axis, and the sex differences therein important in disease risk and resilience throughout the lifespan. },

 abstract = {Mammals exhibit marked interindividual variations in their gut microbiota, but it remains unclear if this is primarily driven by host genetics or by extrinsic factors like dietary intake. To address this, we examined the effect of dietary perturbations on the gut microbiota of five inbred mouse strains, mice deficient for genes relevant to host-microbial interactions (MyD88(-/-), NOD2(-/-), ob/ob, and Rag1(-/-)), and >200 outbred mice. In each experiment, consumption of a high-fat, high-sugar diet reproducibly altered the gut microbiota despite differences in host genotype. The gut microbiota exhibited a linear dose response to dietary perturbations, taking an average of 3.5 days for each diet-responsive bacterial group to reach a new steady state. Repeated dietary shifts demonstrated that most changes to the gut microbiota are reversible, while also uncovering bacteria whose abundance depends on prior consumption. These results emphasize the dominant role that diet plays in shaping interindividual variations in host-associated microbial communities. },

Developmental programs for oogenesis also contribute to variation in aging-related reproductive declines among female vertebrates. Documented reproductive aging patterns in female vertebrates, including humans, are consistent with canonical aging patterns determined developmentally and require no special adaptive explanation. Here we discuss patterns of aging-related ovarian decline in diverse female vertebrates, and place human ovarian aging in comparative context. Depletion of finite oocyte stores accompanied by fertility loss occurs in a variety of nonhuman mammals and vertebrates, including short-lived rodents, birds, and some fishes; moreover, postreproductive lifespans of considerable length clearly are not limited to long-lived, social species with well-developed kin networks. We argue for a more rigorous comparative approach for understanding the evolutionary and developmental bases of ovarian aging in vertebrates with a wider range of aging patterns and social structures.},

 abstract = {The Maasai of northern Tanzania, a semi-nomadic ethnic group predominantly reliant on pastoralism, face a number of challenges anticipated to have negative impacts on child health, including marginalisation, vulnerabilities to drought, substandard service provision and on-going land grabbing conflicts. Yet, stemming from a lack of appropriate national survey data, no large-scale comparative study of Maasai child health has been conducted. Savannas Forever Tanzania surveyed the health of over 3500 children from 56 villages in northern Tanzania between 2009 and 2011. The major ethnic groups sampled were the Maasai, Sukuma, Rangi, and the Meru. Using multilevel regression we compare each ethnic group on the basis of (i) measurements of child health, including anthropometric indicators of nutritional status and self-reported incidence of disease; and (ii) important proximate determinants of child health, including food insecurity, diet, breastfeeding behaviour and vaccination coverage. We then (iii) contrast households among the Maasai by the extent to which subsistence is reliant on livestock herding. Measures of both child nutritional status and disease confirm that the Maasai are substantially disadvantaged compared to neighbouring ethnic groups, Meru are relatively advantaged, and Rangi and Sukuma intermediate in most comparisons. However, Maasai children were less likely to report malaria and worm infections. Food insecurity was high throughout the study site, but particularly severe for the Maasai, and reflected in lower dietary intake of carbohydrate-rich staple foods, and fruits and vegetables. Breastfeeding was extended in the Maasai, despite higher reported consumption of cow's milk, a potential weaning food. Vaccination coverage was lowest in Maasai and Sukuma. Maasai who rely primarily on livestock herding showed signs of further disadvantage compared to Maasai relying primarily on agriculture. We discuss the potential ecological, socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors responsible for these differences and the implications for population health research and policy.},

First, if the unit of analysis is also a culture or society, demonstrable face or content validity must establish that the units of observation in a sample of cultures or societies are a random sample from the population from which the sample is deemed to be drawn. Second, where units of analysis (e.g., individuals) are aggregated into units of observation (i.e., cultures or societies), appropriate data analysis must be used. Unless these conditions are met, two varieties of error may result: The sample used may not be a valid, representative subset of the population, or analysis of aggregated data as if they were nonaggregated may distort results. Examples are given using the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS). Validity appears to be greater for the SCCS as a sample of societies than a sample of cultures.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Habitual diet plays a major role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota, and also determines the repertoire of microbial metabolites that can influence the host. The typical Western diet corresponds to that of an omnivore; however, the Mediterranean diet (MD), common in the Western Mediterranean culture, is to date a nutritionally recommended dietary pattern that includes high-level consumption of cereals, fruit, vegetables and legumes. To investigate the potential benefits of the MD in this cross-sectional survey, we assessed the gut microbiota and metabolome in a cohort of Italian individuals in relation to their habitual diets.
DESIGN AND RESULTS: We retrieved daily dietary information and assessed gut microbiota and metabolome in 153 individuals habitually following omnivore, vegetarian or vegan diets. The majority of vegan and vegetarian subjects and 30% of omnivore subjects had a high adherence to the MD. We were able to stratify individuals according to both diet type and adherence to the MD on the basis of their dietary patterns and associated microbiota. We detected significant associations between consumption of vegetable-based diets and increased levels of faecal short-chain fatty acids, <i>Prevotella</i> and some fibre-degrading Firmicutes, whose role in human gut warrants further research. Conversely, we detected higher urinary trimethylamine oxide levels in individuals with lower adherence to the MD.
CONCLUSIONS: High-level consumption of plant foodstuffs consistent with an MD is associated with beneficial microbiome-related metabolomic profiles in subjects ostensibly consuming a Western diet.

DESIGN/SUBJECTS: A case-control study of 313 individuals with CL/P from Shanghai, China, with 201 unaffected relatives as controls.
METHODS: Size-adjusted asymmetry scores were defined by data on middle-finger length, palm length, palpebral fissure width, and ear length. Case-control comparisons used a multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance, paired t tests, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: The ear-length measure showed a significant increase in fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in individuals with CL/P compared with their unaffected relatives, which was most pronounced in the female cleft lip and palate subgroup (p = .04). No other measures showed any increase in FA.
CONCLUSION: Evidence was found for increased FA, as measured by overall ear length, in Chinese individuals with nonsyndromic CL/P, compared with their unaffected family members. The use of bilateral measurements other than dermatoglyphics may prove to be a valuable means of assessing overall developmental stability in individuals with developmental malformations and in their families.},

The challenge is to explain why losing the ability to mate has evolved as a superior strategy for transmitting genes into future generations. We propose that two conditions are necessary for the evolution of sterility: completely overlapping generations and monogamy. A review of the literature indicates that when these two conditions are met we consistently observe the evolution of sterile helpers. We explain the theory and evidence behind these ideas, and discuss the importance of ecology in predicting whether sterility will evolve using examples from social birds, mammals, and insects. In doing so, we offer an explanation for the extraordinary lifespans of some cooperative species which hint at ways in which we can unlock the secrets of long life.},

 abstract = {In this chapter we discuss the implications of African populations’ great diversity for pharmacogenomics and stratified medicine—including those in Africa and those in the African diaspora. Overwhelming evidence indicates that Homo sapiens developed in Central-Eastern Africa about 200,000years ago. Various migrations occurred from Africa to Europe, Asia, and the Americas, as well as within Africa, 40,000–100,000years ago. Adaptation to diet, disease, and climate led to inherited traits that gave rise to distinct populations with physical and physiological differences, including differences in response to pathogens and xenobiotic challenges. The greatest diversity remains in African populations; those that migrated out of Africa show less and less diversity the further their distance from the continent. Diversity is manifested not only genetically but also through ethnolinguistic and cultural differences, together with differences that arise from environmental and sociopolitical factors that may result in epigenetic change. Genetic variation has been studied in many population groups in Africa to characterize evolutionary relationships among humans and to understand differences in disease prevalence and response to drugs. It is clear African population diversity necessitates in-depth pharmacogenomics research to better understand disease processes and to arrive at safe and efficacious treatment of disease on the African continent. Epigenetic variation and its implications in African populations also need to be addressed.},

Furthermore the following tree and fruit physical characteristics were recorded: tree height, bark colour, fruit size, pulp weight, seed weight, seed size and pulp colour. The content (mean ± SD) of vitamin C was 4.78 ± 1.02 g kg−1, sugar 514 ± 72 g kg−1 and fruit weight 293 ± 96 g. There was a significant correlation between annual precipitation of the tree population site and vitamin C content but not with sugar content. For sugar, there were significant positive correlations with latitude and longitude. Negative correlations were found between fruit size and both longitude and latitude with smaller fruits generally being found to the north/east. No relation was found between pulp or bark colour and the sugar or vitamin C content.

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mothers receive childcare and productive assistance from allomaternal helpers in many societies. Although much effort has been aimed toward showing helper effects on maternal reproductive success, less has been directed toward highlighting the full range of potential effects on breeder behavior. I present a model of optimal maternal care with helpers, and tests of derived hypotheses with data collected among the Karo Batak-a group of Indonesian agriculturalists.
METHODS: To test the model's predictions I compared the effect of women receiving help from patrilateral versus matrilateral kin because those kin may provide help with different maternal responsibilities. The model predicts a decrease in maternal allocation to care that is substitutable with the helper contribution and the helper assists with that type of care; it predicts an increase in care that is nonsubstitutable with the helper contribution or substitutable care when the helper assists with other responsibilities. With the exception of one other, most models have failed to account for an increase.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of time spent carrying children supported the model. With matrilateral helpers, women increased carrying; with patrilateral helpers, they decreased it. Time spent farmworking showed the opposite pattern, suggesting that matrilateral helpers effectively decrease costs, nudging optimal maternal care upward. Patterns of breastfeeding provided little support for the model. The results do, however, suggest potential proximate mechanisms by which helpers influence maternal reproductive success in cooperative breeding societies.},

 abstract = {The present study was conducted in Benin to understand the effects of provenance, genetic variation and the effects of soil physicochemical characteristics on nutrient concentration of baobab pulp, leaves and seeds. Baobab parts were sampled from genetically different populations and soils in different climatic zones of Benin. Biochemical composition of baobab pulp, leaves and seeds was matched to different provenance and physicochemical characteristics of the soil. Results showed that the physicochemical characteristics of the soil seem to influence the nutritive value of baobab parts. Specifically, highly basic soils, rich in carbon, clay, fine silt and organic matter seem to positively relate with the concentration of iron, potassium, vitamin C, carbohydrates, zinc, proteins and lipids. However, for those same soils, the observed relationship between the soils and baobab parts concentration in magnesium, calcium, vitamin A and fibers was negative. Soils rich in gross silt and sand were found to have an opposite effect on these same parameters.},

Here, we have compared the fecal microbiota of adults from two non-industrialized regions in Papua New Guinea (PNG) with that of United States (US) residents. Papua New Guineans harbor communities with greater bacterial diversity, lower inter-individual variation, vastly different abundance profiles, and bacterial lineages undetectable in US residents. A quantification of the ecological processes that govern community assembly identified bacterial dispersal as the dominant process that shapes the microbiome in PNG but not in the US. These findings suggest that the microbiome alterations detected in industrialized societies might arise from modern lifestyle factors limiting bacterial dispersal, which has implications for human health and the development of strategies aimed to redress the impact of westernization.},

 abstract = {Background/Objectives:The gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. The eating habits of Saudis are much different than those of Europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight Saudis and French.Subjects/Methods:Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from Saudi Arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from France.Results:Obese French possessed significantly more relative Proteobacteria (P=0.002) and Bacteroidetes (P=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs (P<0.05) than normal weight French. Obese Saudis possessed significantly more Firmicutes (P=0.001) without a difference in richness (P=0.2) and biodiversity (P=0.3) compared with normal weight Saudis. We found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in ⩾50% of obese and normal weight Saudis and 29 species in ⩾50% of obese and normal weight French. Actinomyces odontolyticus, Escherichia coli and Ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. French individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with Saudis at all the OTU cutoffs (P<0.05).Conclusion:Microbiota differences between obese and normal weight French were not similar to those between obese and normal weight Saudis. The studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.},

 abstract = {Demographic variations in a given population are frequently associated to environmental changes. The social, economic, and cultural particularities of indigenous populations would then produce a great variety of demographic regimes. Although Latin America, in general, and in Argentina, in particular, have experienced an important decline in fertility, indigenous populations in this region show demographic changes that are at odds with this trend. This study evaluates fertility parameters and their determinants in the Toba population of Cacique Sombrero Negro, in northern Argentina, which is undergoing a significant lifestyle change. A total of 336 Toba women were interviewed, allowing the calculation of age-specific fertility rates, total fertility rates, parity progression ratios and primary infertility rates for women born between 1920 and 1966. For these women, we also estimated age of the mother at first birth, interbirth intervals and mother's age at last birth. Our results indicate that, compared to women born between 1920 and 1945, those born between 1946 y 1966 show an increase in fertility values, a decline in age at first birth, a faster reproductive pace and an increase in age at last birth. These results suggest favorable social, sanitary, biological and economic changes that would have determined an increase in fertility parameters in the younger cohort.},

 abstract = {Clicks are often considered an exotic feature of languages, and the fact that certain African “Khoisan” groups share the use of clicks as consonants and exhibit deep genetic divergences has been argued to indicate that clicks trace back to an early common ancestral language ( Knight et al. 2003 ). Here, we review the linguistic evidence concerning the use of click sounds in languages and the genetic evidence concerning the relationships of African click-speaking groups. The linguistic evidence suggests that genealogical inheritance and contact-induced transmission are equally relevant for the distribution of clicks in African languages. The genetic evidence indicates that there has been substantial genetic drift in some groups, obscuring their genetic relationships. Overall, the presence of clicks in human languages may in fact not trace back to the dawn of human language, but instead reflect a much later episode in the diversification of human speech.},

A broader-biological model is presented, which emphasizes the role of hormones in healthy functioning. Hormones are team players in complex, multidetermined systems that have a purpose. Hormones act in concert with other physiological systems and with sensory and social inputs. Human biology is both similar to and different from that of other animals. The implications of these assumptions for understanding menopause are discussed, especially the kinds of questions that are asked and the kinds of evidence needed before conclusions are drawn with regard to clinically significant areas. A broader-biological model of menopause provides a framework within which health-related issues can be considered from a perspective that is, on the one hand, more holistic, and on the other hand, more attentive to individual differences.},

 abstract = {The departure from traditional lifestyles and the rising disease burden of mental disorders are increasing global health concerns. Changes in diet around the world mean that populations are now increasingly reliant on highly processed, poor quality foods, which have been linked to increased risk for mental disorder. Conversely, a nutrient-rich diet is understood to be protective of mental health, and researchers are now aiming to understand the biological underpinnings of this relationship. The gut microbiota has been proposed as a key mediator of this link, given its association with both diet and mental health. Importantly, several critical "windows of opportunity" for prevention and intervention have been identified, particularly early life and adolescence; these are periods of rapid development and transition that provide a foundation for future health. Strategies that promote overall diet quality, high in fiber and nutrients, have been linked to increased microbial diversity and gut health. Improving diet quality and subsequent gut health may have benefits for individuals' mental health, as well as the mental health of future generations. Here we discuss specific, targeted dietary and gut focused strategies for the prevention and treatment of mental disorder.},

Focusing on eastern Africa, a region frequently plagued with subsistence uncertainty as well as violence, this paper explores the relationships between resource problems, including resource unpredictability, chronic scarcity, and warfare frequencies. It also examines whether resource scarcity predicts more resource-taking in land, movable property, and people, as well as the commission of atrocities. Results support previous worldwide results regarding the relationship between resource unpredictability and warfare frequency. Results regarding resource-taking and atrocities are more nuanced and complex. In almost all findings, relationships are generally in opposite directions in nonstate and state societies. In post-hoc analyses, atrocities are significantly more likely to be committed in states than in nonstates.},

 abstract = {This paper examines family resemblance for five anthropometric measurements (height, weight, triceps skinfold, upper arm circumference relaxed [UACR] and flexed [UACF] and for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a group of adult Caribbean islanders of primarily African ancestry. Six hypotheses about family resemblance are tested by using path analysis and likelihood ratios. Significant intergenerational transmission is found only for height and UACR. For weight, UACF, and diastolic blood pressure, non-transmissible sibling resemblance is the primary component of family resemblance, although significant marital resemblance exists for diastolic blood pressure. Triceps skinfold and systolic blood pressure show no evidence of any family resemblance. Although results for highly heritable traits such as height are comparable to reports from other populations, measurements with a large contribution from common family environment or residual environmental effects, such as triceps skinfold or blood pressure, have much lower family resemblance in this population than in other populations. We hypothesize that this difference is due to the fact that adult children and their parents do not share a common household in this culture and to the presence of major nonfamilial environmental factors contributing to obesity and hypertension in this population.},

The Udzungwa red colobus monkey (Procolobus gordonorum) is among the most threatened primate species in Africa. Primarily arboreal and highly sensitive to hunting and habitat destruction, they provide a critical model to understanding whether anthropogenic disturbance impacts gut microbiota diversity. We sampled seven social groups inhabiting two forests (disturbed vs. undisturbed) in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. While Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae dominated in all individuals, reflecting their role in extracting energy from folivorous diets, analysis of genus composition showed a marked diversification across habitats, with gut microbiota α-diversity significantly higher in the undisturbed forest. Functional analysis suggests that such variation may be associated with food plant diversity in natural versus human-modified habitats, requiring metabolic pathways to digest xenobiotics. Thus, the effects of changes in gut microbiota should not be ignored to conserve endangered populations.},

Evidence is emerging to suggest that microbes may play a beneficial role in body sites traditionally viewed as being sterile.

The class of segments discussed in the chapter is the one that consists of an interval of time that is considered to be a single consonantal element but which contain a subpart during which the velopharyngeal port is open and the oral escape of air is blocked. The chapter presents the distinctions between underlying and derived prenasalized stops. The prenasalized stops are persuasively analyzed as single segments from the phonological point of view. There are stops of two types, voiceless oral and voiced prenasalized. These two types of stop have the same distributional patterns.},

Here we present a test of optimal foraging theory in groups of street children working for money. The children we observed were selling bottles of water to drivers distributed in two lanes at a crossroad of Istanbul, Turkey. As predicted by the ideal free distribution (a model of optimal group foraging), the ratio of children working in the two lanes was sensitive to the ratio of cars (and therefore the ratio of potential buyers) present in each lane. Deviations from the ideal free model arose largely from numerical restrictions on the set of possible ratios compatible with a small group size. When these constraints were taken into account, optimal behavior emerged as a robust aspect of the children's group distribution. Our results extend to human children aspects of group foraging that were previously tested in human adults or other animal species.},

 abstract = {Though microbial infections are central concerns for public health workers in urban Nicaragua, health workers there rarely if ever speak of the existence of a ‘microbiome’ when they address such problems. Among scientists and the public in the United States, on the other hand, the microbiome, seen as the ‘internal ecosystem’ that regulates the workings of human guts, is a regular topic of conversation. This raises questions about how one might go about doing a social study of the microbiome in places where it does not (yet) exist as a category of expert practice or public discourse. Evidence from Nicaragua and the United States highlights two sites at which experts engage people in research and discussion about microbial ecologies. In their work, U.S. microbiome scientists and Nicaraguan public health workers both engage in ‘paraethnography,’ the practice of collecting and analyzing qualitative information that does not fit into statistical or other kinds of scientific models. In the United States, paraethnography has driven both traditional scientific experiments on the microbiome and online, crowd-sourced experimental platforms for collecting and analyzing information about gut microbes. In Nicaragua, hygienists generate paraethnographic evidence through word-of-mouth, radio, and print media. A comparison between the work of U.S. scientists and that of Nicaraguan hygienists suggests three different ways (commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic) in which the cultural/interpretive evidence of paraethnography interfaces symbiotically with the quantitative/statistical evidence of bioscience.

 abstract = {Two kinds of evidence suggest that female fertility may end at an earlier age in modern people than in ancestral populations or in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. We investigate both to see whether fertility schedules or ovarian follicle counts falsify the alternative hypothesis that the age of terminal fertility changed little in the human lineage while greater longevity evolved due to grandmother effects. We use 19th century Utah women to represent non-contracepting humans, and compare their fertility by age with published records for wild chimpanzees. Then we revisit published counts of ovarian follicular stocks in both species. Results show wide individual variation in age at last birth and oocyte stocks in both humans and chimpanzees. This heterogeneity, combined with interspecific differences in adult mortality, has large and opposing effects on fertility schedules. Neither realized fertility nor rates of follicular atresia stand as evidence against the hypothesis that ages at last birth changed little while greater longevity evolved in our lineage.},

 abstract = {As our closest living relatives, great apes likely experience physiological patterns associated with reproductive aging that are similar to humans. We present results from a nationwide zoo-based study on female western lowland gorillas during which we evaluated concentrations of progestogens via daily fecal sampling in 30 gorillas, 22 of whom were geriatric (>or=30). Whereas control females cycled regularly, ca. 23% of geriatric females were acyclic (menopausal), and approximately 1/3 showed variable hormonal patterns suggestive of perimenopause. Patterns included increased cycle variability, low luteal phase rises of progestogens - possibly indicative of anovulatory cycling - and peak height variability of progestogens in the luteal phase of the cycle. We discovered a progressive trend toward increased variability in estrous cycle length and toward decreased concentrations of fecal progestogens when we compared control to geriatric cycling and to geriatric noncycling females. Noncycling females had significantly lower overall progestogen concentrations than the cycling females, though differences were not significant when cycle phase was incorporated. Preliminary analyses of follow-up data on 10 perimenopausal females indicated that subjects experienced age-related changes in reproductive function that mirrored those observed in aging human females including a female who transitioned from perimenopause to menopause. To date, maximum longevity in captive female gorillas is 52 years, with poor reproductive prognosis beginning from the age of 37 suggesting a postreproductive lifespan of >25%. Continued study of aging apes is warranted, with emphasis on longitudinal monitoring of aged subjects.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe human gut microbiota interacts closely with human diet and physiology. To better understand the mechanisms behind this relationship, gut microbiome research relies on complementing human studies with manipulations of animal models, including non-human primates. However, due to unique aspects of human diet and physiology, it is likely that host-gut microbe interactions operate differently in humans and non-human primates.ResultsHere, we show that the human microbiome reacts differently to a high-protein, high-fat Western diet than that of a model primate, the African green monkey, or vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). Specifically, humans exhibit increased relative abundance of Firmicutes and reduced relative abundance of Prevotella on a Western diet while vervets show the opposite pattern. Predictive metagenomics demonstrate an increased relative abundance of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome of only humans consuming a Western diet.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the human gut microbiota has unique properties that are a result of changes in human diet and physiology across evolution or that may have contributed to the evolution of human physiology. Therefore, the role of animal models for understanding the relationship between the human gut microbiota and host metabolism must be re-focused.},

 abstract = {The understanding of the genetic basis of neurological disorders has grown rapidly in the last two decades. Despite the genomic heterogeneity within African populations, large-scale candidate gene or linkage and exome studies are lacking. However, current knowledge on neurogenetics in African populations is limited and geographically very uneven. Isolated reports indicate the existence of autosomal dominant or recessive conditions incorporating cerebrovascular, movement, neuromuscular, seizure and motor neuron disorders in Africans. In addition, few African families with neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia have been characterized in North, West and South Africa. The current insurgency in genomic research triggered by among others the Human Health and Heredity (H3) Africa Initiative indicates that there are unique opportunities to advance our knowledge and understanding of the influence of genomic variation on the pattern, presentations and prognosis of neurological disorders in Africa. These have enormous potential to unmask novel genes and molecular pathways germane to the neurobiology of brain disorders. It would facilitate the development of novel diagnostics, preventative and targeted treatments in the new paradigm of precision medicine. Nevertheless, it is crucial to strike a balance between effective traditional public health strategies and personalized genome based care. The translational barriers can be overcome through robust stakeholder engagement and sustainable multilevel, multigenerational and multidisciplinary capacity building and infrastructural development for genomic medicine in Africa. },

@article{pub.1036541131,
 abstract = {We use a two-sex partial differential equation (PDE) model based on the Grandmother hypothesis. We build on an earlier model by Kim et al. (2014) by allowing for evolution in both longevity and age at last birth, and also assuming that post-fertile females support only their daughters' fertility. Similarly to Kim et al. (2014), we find that only two locally stable equilibria exist: one corresponding to great ape-like longevities and the other corresponding to hunter-gatherer longevities. Our results show that grandmothering enables the transition between these two equilibria, without extending the end of fertility. Moreover, sensitivity analyses of the model show that male competition, arising from a skew in the mating sex ratio towards males, plays a significant role in determining whether the transition from great ape-like longevities to higher longevities is possible and the equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan. Whereas grandmothering effects have a significant impact on the equilibrium value of the average age at last birth and enable the transition to higher longevities, they have an insignificant impact on the equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan. },

There has been a recent "rediscovery" and growing respect for many of the concepts and themes that are clearly articulated in Dr. Freedman's early work. The contents of this book reflect this emerging reorientation within psychology and related fields. Principles, techniques, and interpretations from behavioral genetics, human ethology, evolutionary psychology, and cross-cultural analyses are uniquely interwoven.

 abstract = {The mother–adult daughter relationship has been highlighted in both the social sciences and the public health literature as an important facet of social support networks, particularly as they pertain to maternal and child health. Evolutionary anthropologists also have shown positive associations between support from maternal grandmothers and various outcomes related to reproductive success; however, many of these studies rely on proximity as a surrogate measure of support. Here I present data from the Puerto Rican Maternal and Infant Health Survey (PRMIHS) comparing geographic proximity of mother and daughter with a self-reported measure of mother-to-daughter support. These two measures were used to predict infant health outcomes as well as various measures of instrumental and emotional aid provided during pregnancy and after birth. Primary support was shown to have a positive effect across the analyses, whereas geographic proximity was associated with an increased risk of infant mortality and low birth weight as well as reduced odds of receiving support. This paradox was then examined using a combination variable that teased out the interactions of maternal support and proximity. Women who were geographically close to their mothers but who did not consider them a primary source of support had increased odds of infant death and low birth weight, and were less likely to receive either tangible or intangible forms of aid, while women whose mothers were both close and primary showed uniformly positive outcomes. These results place the role of propinquity within the larger context of social support and highlight the need for more detailed studies of social support within evolutionary anthropology.},

 abstract = {We propose that longevity is not merely the result of an absence of mortality but a self-reinforcing and positively selected life history trait in social species. We develop the argument that a small increase in longevity is amplified as (1) reductions in mortality at young ages increases natural selection for mechanisms of maintenance and repair at all older ages as well as increasing the potential for intergenerational transfers; (2) intergenerational transfers of resources from old to young increase fitness (e.g. through improved health, skill, and competitive ability) of the young and thus favour the presence of older individuals in a population; and (3) the division of labour increases both efficiency and innovation at all levels resulting in increased resources that can be invested. This is a theory framed around the longevity-oriented question posed two decades ago by George Sacher “Why do we live as long as we do?” rather than the more prevalent question today “Why do we age?” We describe the foundational principles and the main phases of our model for the evolution of longevity mediated through social organization and apply the concept specifically to human populations.},

Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum 25-3(T), a butyrate-producing clostridial cluster IV strain, is such a candidate. Little is known about its abundance in the colon microbiota and its butyrogenic properties. We used the M-SHIME(®), an in vitro simulator for the human intestinal microbial ecosystem, to study the effect of supplementing a single dose of B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) on lumen- and mucus-associated microbiota of eight individuals. Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum was more abundant in mucus-associated microbiota compared with lumen microbiota. Supplementation with a single dose of B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) resulted in a temporary increase in B. pullicaecorum bacteria in lumen compartment of all individuals. In two cases, the responders, an increased butyrate production was observed as compared with the control. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed the microbiota of responders to be different as compared to non-responder microbiota. We can conclude that B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) is a mucus-associated bacterium whose potency to stimulate butyrate production is characterized by a large interindividual variability in terms of composition of the receiving microbial community.},

Comparison of similarities and differences in human and nonhuman primate lactation biology suggests humans have evolved an unusually flexible strategy for feeding young. Several lines of indirect evidence are consistent with a hypothesis that complementary feeding evolved as a facultative strategy that provided a unique adaptation for resolving tradeoffs between maternal costs of lactation and risk of poor infant outcomes. This evolved flexibility may have been adaptive in the environments in which humans evolved, but it creates potential for mismatch between optimal and actual feeding practices in many contemporary populations.},

 abstract = {Humans are virtually identical in their genetic makeup, yet the small differences in our DNA give rise to tremendous phenotypic diversity across the human population. By contrast, the metagenome of the human microbiome—the total DNA content of microbes inhabiting our bodies—is quite a bit more variable, with only a third of its constituent genes found in a majority of healthy individuals. Understanding this variability in the “healthy microbiome” has thus been a major challenge in microbiome research, dating back at least to the 1960s, continuing through the Human Microbiome Project and beyond. Cataloguing the necessary and sufficient sets of microbiome features that support health, and the normal ranges of these features in healthy populations, is an essential first step to identifying and correcting microbial configurations that are implicated in disease. Toward this goal, several population-scale studies have documented the ranges and diversity of both taxonomic compositions and functional potentials normally observed in the microbiomes of healthy populations, along with possible driving factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle. Here, we review several definitions of a ‘healthy microbiome’ that have emerged, the current understanding of the ranges of healthy microbial diversity, and gaps such as the characterization of molecular function and the development of ecological therapies to be addressed in the future.},

We estimate Cox proportional hazard models for parity progression based on the presence of kin and non-kin in the household while controlling for a large number of individual and community-level characteristics. We find that couples living with their brothers experienced shorter birth intervals whereas couples residing with a widowed father had relatively longer birth intervals. The effects of these types of kin on reproduction were most pronounced up to the birth of the fifth child, but not thereafter. We found no effect for mothers or other types of kin.},

 abstract = {Most animals reproduce until they die, but in humans, females can survive long after ceasing reproduction1,2. In theory, a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan will evolve when females can gain greater fitness by increasing the success of their offspring than by continuing to breed themselves3,4,5,6. Although reproductive success is known to decline in old age1,2,3,4,5,6, it is unknown whether women gain fitness by prolonging lifespan post-reproduction. Using complete multi-generational demographic records, we show that women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren, and hence greater fitness, in pre-modern populations of both Finns and Canadians. This fitness benefit arises because post-reproductive mothers enhance the lifetime reproductive success of their offspring by allowing them to breed earlier, more frequently and more successfully. Finally, the fitness benefits of prolonged lifespan diminish as the reproductive output of offspring declines. This suggests that in female humans, selection for deferred ageing should wane when one's own offspring become post-reproductive and, correspondingly, we show that rates of female mortality accelerate as their offspring terminate reproduction.},

 abstract = {The coastal environments of South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) provide some of the earliest and most abundant evidence for the emergence of cognitively modern humans. In particular, the south coast of the CFR provided a uniquely diverse resource base for hunter-gatherers, which included marine shellfish, game, and carbohydrate-bearing plants, especially those with Underground Storage Organs (USOs). It has been hypothesized that these resources underpinned the continuity of human occupation in the region since the Middle Pleistocene. Very little research has been conducted on the foraging potential of carbohydrate resources in the CFR. This study focuses on the seasonal availability of plants with edible carbohydrates at six-weekly intervals over a two-year period in four vegetation types on South Africa's Cape south coast. Different plant species were considered available to foragers if the edible carbohydrate was directly (i.e. above-ground edible portions) or indirectly (above-ground indications to below-ground edible portions) visible to an expert botanist familiar with this landscape. A total of 52 edible plant species were recorded across all vegetation types. Of these, 33 species were geophytes with edible USOs and 21 species had aboveground edible carbohydrates. Limestone Fynbos had the richest flora, followed by Strandveld, Renosterveld and lastly, Sand Fynbos. The availability of plant species differed across vegetation types and between survey years. The number of available USO species was highest for a six-month period from winter to early summer (Jul-Dec) across all vegetation types. Months of lowest species' availability were in mid-summer to early autumn (Jan-Apr); the early winter (May-Jun) values were variable, being highest in Limestone Fynbos. However, even during the late summer carbohydrate "crunch," 25 carbohydrate bearing species were visible across the four vegetation types. To establish a robust resource landscape will require additional spatial mapping of plant species abundances. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that plant-based carbohydrate resources available to Stone Age foragers of the Cape south coast, especially USOs belonging to the Iridaceae family, are likely to have comprised a reliable and nutritious source of calories over most of the year. },

 abstract = {In female mammals, fertility declines abruptly at an advanced age. The human menopause is one example, but reproductive cessation has also been documented in non-human primates, rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic livestock1,2,3. The human menopause has been considered an evolutionary adaptation4,5,6,7 assuming that elderly women avoid the increasing complications of continued childbirth to better nurture their current children and grandchildren. But an abrupt reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of life-history patterns. Because so many individuals die from starvation, disease and predation, detrimental genetic traits can persist (or even be favoured) as long as their deleterious effects are delayed until an advanced age is reached, and, for a given pattern of mortality, there should be an age by which selection would be too weak to prevent the onset of reproductive senescence4,5,8. We provide a systematic test of these alternatives using field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in kin-directed behaviour. Both species show abrupt age-specific changes in reproductive performance that are characteristic of menopause. But elderly females do not suffer increased mortality costs of reproduction, nor do post-reproductive females enhance the fitness of grandchildren or older children. Instead, reproductive cessation appears to result from senescence.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a study of genetic variation in sub-Saharan Africa, which is based on published and unpublished data on fast-evolving (hypervariable region 1 of mitochondrial DNA and six microsatellites of Y chromosome) and slow-evolving (haplogroup frequencies) polymorphisms of mtDNA and Y chromosome. Our study reveals a striking difference in the genetic structure of food-producer (Bantu and Sudanic speakers) and hunter-gatherer populations (Pygmies, Kung, and Hadza). In fact, the ratio of mtDNA to Y-chromosome Nupsilon is substantially higher in food producers than in hunter-gatherers as determined by fast-evolving polymorphisms (1.76 versus 0.11). This finding indicates that the two population groups differ substantially in female and male migration rate and/or effective size. The difference also persists when linguistically homogeneous populations are used and outlier populations are eliminated (1.78 vs 0.19) or when the jacknife procedure is applied to a paired population data set (1.32 to 7.84 versus 0.14 to 0.66). The higher ratio of mtDNA to Y-chromosome Nnu in food producers than in hunter-gatherers is further confirmed by the use of slow-evolving polymorphisms (1.59 to 7.91 versus 0.12 to 0.35). To explain these results, we propose a model that integrates demographic and genetic aspects and incorporates ethnographic knowledge. In such a model, the asymmetric gene flow, polyginy, and patrilocality play an important role in differentiating the genetic structure of sub-Saharan populations. The existence of an asymmetric gene flow is supported by the phylogeographic features of mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups found in the two population groups. The role of polyginy and patrilocality is sustained by the evidence of a differential pressure of genetic drift and gene flow on maternal and paternal lineages of food producers and hunter-gatherers that is revealed through the analysis of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal intrapopulational variation.},

 abstract = {Globally, micronutrient deficiencies are more prevalent than calorie and protein deficiencies. In order to address global micronutrient deficiencies, increasing attention is being paid to the nutritional quality of people's diets. While conventional agriculture is key for ensuring adequate calories, dietary quality depends on the consumption of a diverse range of micronutrient rich foods. Many wild foods are rich in micronutrients, particularly fruits, vegetables, and animal source food. As a result there has been increasing interest in the value of wild foods to meeting nutritional requirements. We review literature on the consumption of wild foods in dry forest areas to assess the current state of knowledge as to how dry forests may contribute to nutrition. We focus on papers that quantify consumption of wild forest foods. Although there is a great deal of literature that lends weight to the notion that dry forests are important for food security and nutrition, we find surprisingly little evidence of direct contributions to diets. Of 2514 articles identified by our search, only four quantify the consumption of wild foods from dry forests, and only one of these puts this consumption in the context of the entire diet. There is a need for research on the nutritional importance of dry forest foods which combines methodologies from nutrition science with an understanding and appreciation of the ecological, social, cultural and economic context.},

 abstract = {A network of multiple caregivers contributing to the care of an infant is the norm in many non-Western cultural contexts. Current observational measures of caregiver sensitive responsiveness to infant signals focus on single caregivers, failing to capture the total experience of the infant when it comes to the sensitive responsiveness received from multiple sources. The current paper aims to introduce the construct of received sensitivity that captures the sensitivity that an infant experiences from multiple sources in cultural contexts where simultaneous multiple caregiving is common. The paper further presents an adaptation of Ainsworth's Sensitivity versus Insensitivity observation scale to allow for the assessment of sensitivity as received by the infant regardless of who is providing the sensitive responses to its signals. The potential usefulness of the Received Sensitivity scale is illustrated by two case studies of infants from an Agta forager community in the Philippines where infants are routinely taken care of by multiple caregivers. The case studies show that the infants' total experience of being responded to sensitively cannot be simply derived from the sum of individual caregiver sensitivity scores, demonstrating the potential added value of the new Received Sensitivity observation measure. },

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic predisposition to obesity may have contributed to the obesity epidemic through assortative mating. We investigated whether spouses were positively assorted by body mass index (BMI; = kg/m(2)) in late childhood, and whether changes in assorted marriage by upper BMI-percentiles occurred during the obesity epidemic.
METHODS: In the Copenhagen School Health Records Register (CSHRR) boys and girls with measures of BMI at age 13 years later became 37,792 spousal-pairs who married between 1945 and 2010. Trends in the spousal BMI correlations using sex-, age-, and birth cohort-specific BMI z-scores across time were investigated. Odds ratios (ORs) of marriage among spouses both with BMI z-scores >90th or >95th percentile compared with marriage among spouses ≤90th percentile were analyzed for marriages entered during the years prior to (1945-1970), and during the obesity epidemic (1971-2010).
FINDINGS: Spousal BMI correlations were around 0.05 and stayed similar across time. ORs of marriage among spouses with BMIs >90th percentile at age 13 were 1.21, 1.05-1.39, in 1945-1970, and increased to 1.63, 1.40-1.91, in 1971-2010 (p = 0.006). ORs of marriage among spouses both >95th BMI percentile were higher and increased more; from 1.39, 1.10-1.81, to 2.39, 1.85-3.09 (p = 0.004).
INTERPRETATION: Spousal correlations by pre-marital BMIs were small and stable during the past 65 years. Yet, there were assorted marriages between spouses with high BMI at age 13 years and the tendency increased alongside with the obesity epidemic which may increase the offsprings' predisposition to obesity.},

 abstract = {Modern humans have brains that are between three and five times the size that would be expected for average mammals of human body mass (Aiello & Wheeler, 1995, 1996; Aiello, 1997). Because brain tissue per unit mass has a basal metabolism that is over 22 times higher than the same amount of muscle tissue, a relatively large brain would be expected to have a significant effect on human energy budgets. In the recent literature on human evolution there has been considerable interest in the ways in which the metabolic costs of the large human brain may have either constrained or influenced adaptation and behavior. Focus has centered on how it is possible to grow such a large brain (Martin, 1996), on how adult humans might adjust their energy budgets to maintain their large brains (Aiello & Wheeler, 1995, 1996; Aiello, 1997), and on the implications of the metabolic aspects of brain growth and maintenance for human dietary evolution (Leonard & Robertson, 1992, 1994, 1997), life history evolution (Foley & Lee, 1991), social evolution (Key & Aiello, 1999, 2000), and symbolic evolution (Power & Aiello, 1997). One recent hypothesis has also suggested that the increase in relative brain size during the course of human evolution might be better explained by the metabolic resources available to mothers during gestation and lactation rather than by any specific behavioral feature (for example feeding ecology or complexity of social organization) that might be postulated to exert a selective pressure for a relative increase in brain size (Martin, 1996).},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The timing and duration of breastfeeding and weaning in past hunter-gatherer populations are discussed based on the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses undertaken on a Late Holocene skeletal sample from Lake Salitroso in the Patagonian steppe (Argentina). Research in Lake Salitroso is part of a regional project that studies the relationship between hunter-gatherer societies, their organizational systems and the environmental changes during the last 3,000 years in Patagonia.
METHODS: The sample included 52 individuals: 33 subadults and 19 adults of both sexes. They were recovered from 24 burial stone structures, locally called chenques, with dates ranging from ca. 800 BP to 350 BP. Ribs were selected for collagen extraction and measurement of (13) C/(12) C and (15) N/(14) N ratios.
RESULTS: A δ(13) C mean value of -18.7‰ ± 0.5‰ was obtained, with a range between -19.8‰ and -17.1‰ whereas δ(15) N recorded a mean of 11.9‰ ± 1.1‰ with a range between 10.1‰ and 14.8‰. δ(15) N data showed an age-related pattern with particularly marked difference between values for subadults under the age of 4 and older individuals. As opposed to δ(15) N, δ(13) C showed little variation with age.
CONCLUSIONS: An early incorporation of supplementary solid food between 0.75 and 2 years of age and a late cessation of breastfeeding at about 5-6 years of age were inferred. This suggests that among this Patagonian hunter-gatherer population weaning was a gradual and lengthy process. These results are consistent with the patterns observed in cross-cultural studies and archaeological samples of hunter-gatherer groups.},

 abstract = {It has often been argued that the success and spread of modern humans ∼50,000years ago was due to a series of key behavioral shifts that conferred particular adaptive advantages. And yet, particularly during the African Middle Stone Age (MSA), some of these “modern” behaviors see only patchy expression across time and space. Recent models have proposed a link between the emergence of modern behaviors and environmental degradation and/or demographic stress. Under these models, modern behaviors represent a form of social/economic intensification in response to stress; if this were the case, signs of subsistence intensification should be more common during periods in which these behaviors are manifested than when they are not. In order to test these models, I analyzed faunal remains from Sibudu Cave (South Africa), focusing on the Howieson’s Poort (HP), a phase in which modern behaviors are evidenced, and the post-HP MSA, when classical signatures of such behavior have disappeared. Significant variability in hunting behavior was identified. While much of this variability appears to correspond with changes in the local environment, evidence for resource stress was more common during the HP. The implications of these results to our understanding of the evolution of human culture are discussed.},

 abstract = {Acute alcohol consumption increases ratings of attractiveness to faces. This may help to explain increased frequencies of sexual encounters during periods of alcohol intoxication. At least in part, such increased attraction may be the result of alcohol consumption decreasing ability to detect bilateral asymmetry, presumably because of the reductions in the levels of visual function. We tested the hypotheses that acute alcohol consumption decreases ability to detect asymmetry in faces and reduces preference for symmetrical faces over asymmetrical faces. Twenty images of a pair of faces and then 20 images of a single face were displayed on a computer, one at a time. Participants were instructed to state which face of each of the face pairs displayed was most attractive and then whether the single face being displayed was symmetrical or not. Data were collected near campus bars at Roehampton University. Sixty-four self-selecting students who undertook the study were classified as either sober (control) or intoxicated with alcohol. For each face pair or single face displayed, participant response was recorded and details of the alcohol consumption of participants that day were also obtained. Sober participants had a greater preference for symmetrical faces and were better at detecting whether a face was symmetrical or otherwise, supporting the hypotheses. A further, unexpected finding was that males made fewer mistakes than did females when determining whether individual faces were asymmetrical. The reduced ability of inebriated people to perceive asymmetry may be an important mechanism underlying the higher ratings of facial attractiveness they give for members of the opposite sex and hence their increased frequency of mate choice.},

This review delineates the concept of social motivation and capitalizes on recent findings in several research areas to provide an integrated account of social motivation at the behavioral, biological and evolutionary levels.

 abstract = {Environmental conditions are a key factor mediating reproductive success or failure. Consequently, many mammalian taxa have breeding seasons that coordinate critical reproductive stages with optimal environmental conditions. However, in contrast with most mammals, baboons (Papio cynocephalus) of Kenya reproduce throughout the year. Here we depart from the typical approach of evaluating seasonal effects on reproduction and engage in a more fine-grained analysis of the actual ecological conditions leading up to reproduction for females. Our aim was to determine how environmental conditions, in combination with social and demographic factors, might mediate baboon reproduction. The data set includes all female reproductive cycles from multiple baboon groups in the Amboseli basin between 1976 and 2004. Results indicate that after periods of drought or extreme heat, females were significantly less likely to cycle than expected. If females did cycle after these conditions, they were less likely to conceive; and if they did conceive after drought (heat effects were nonsignificant), they were less likely to have a successful pregnancy. Age also significantly predicted conceptive failure; conceptive probability was lowest among the youngest and oldest cycling females. There was also a trend for high ambient temperatures to contribute to fetal loss during the first trimester but not other trimesters. Finally, group size and drought conditions interacted in their effects on the probability of conception. Although females in all groups had equal conception probabilities during optimal conditions, females in large groups were less likely than those in small groups to conceive during periods of drought. These results indicate that in a highly variable environment, baboon reproductive success is mediated by the interaction between proximate ecological conditions and individual demographic factors.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women experience more years of vigorous life after ovulation has ceased than do females of other primate species. Is this an epiphenomenon of the greater life expectancy humans have enjoyed in the past century or so, or is long post-menopausal survival the result of an evolutionary selection process? Recent research implies the latter: Long post-menopausal survival came about through natural selection. One prominent line of thought explaining this selection process is the grandmother hypothesis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implications of the hypothesis for non-human primate studies of aging and cognition.
METHOD: The author presents a synopsis of the hypothesis, evaluates the uniqueness of the 'grandmother effect' to humans, and discusses its implications for non-human primate models of cognitive aging.
RESULTS: The hypothesis contends that, in past epochs, women who remained vigorous beyond their fertile years may have enhanced their reproductive success by providing care for their grandchildren. This care would have enabled their daughters to resume reproduction sooner, endowing them with greater lifetime fertility. Genes of grandmothers possessing such old-age vigor would be more likely to persist in subsequent generations. Is midlife menopause a uniquely human phenomenon, or does the chimpanzee, our closest primate relative, also display this trait? If so, we might expect a grandmother effect in this species as well. However, female chimpanzees continue to cycle until near the end of their maximum life span of about 60 years.
CONCLUSION: Long survival beyond fertility and a long life expectancy are distinctive human adaptations. The robustness of ancestral human grandmothers necessarily included resistance to cognitive decline through preservation of functions present in many primates but also development of processes of social cognition unique to our species. Cognitive traits such as language and social cognitive functions may function in our species in particular as mechanisms to compensate for age-related decline. This has significant implications for research in which non-human primates are considered as models of human cognitive aging; it also means that some processes can be studied only in humans.},

However, little is known on the mechanisms that are causing this pattern. Is it due to differences in diet, sanitation, medication, host genetics, and/or other unidentified factors? In this review, we propose that part of this decrease in diversity is driven by latitude, as all studied industrialized countries are in higher latitudes than non-industrialized ones, and latitude is known to correlate with species diversity. Reanalyzing available data, we find that part of the gut microbial diversity is significantly correlated with latitude, which might therefore exacerbate the effect of lifestyle. Intriguingly, the observation of a higher diversity in industrialized countries has not been replicated in other human microbiomes.},

Species having significant amounts of nutrients critical to the nutrition of people living with HIV/AIDS were short listed, and their nutritional values compared to those of recommended conventional foods and daily nutrient intakes. The current and potential value of edible NTFPs in contributing to the nutritional needs of people living with HIV/AIDS suggests that the integration of natural resources and natural resource management in multisectoral HIV/AIDS programs is appropriate and necessary. The process through which such integration can be achieved is explained and demonstrated.

 abstract = {Menopause is widely believed by biological anthropologists and life history theorists to have arisen early in human evolution. In this paper, I suggest that female reproductive senescence was the result of the escalating energetic cost of gestation, lactation and childcare that accompanied the continuing encephalization of early hominid offspring and the ensuing increase in infant altriciality, or helplessness, and the concomitant prolongation of juvenile dependence. Natural selection favored females who became prematurely infertile, as the escalating cost of raising each offspring led to maternal depletion and made it more profitable in terms of lifetime reproductive success to continue investing in existing offspring rather than attempting late pregnancies. Results of a mathematical model are presented which show that reproductive senescence can be advantageous even when maximum potential lifespan is only 50 years, if the premature cessation of reproduction allows females to moderately increase the survival and fertility of their existing subadult offspring. These findings suggest that menopause could have originated as much as 1.5 million years ago, and that if menopause is indeed such an old trait, it was more likely the result of selective pressure on females to invest more in their own children, as opposed to their grandchildren.},

In most species age-specific fertility declined and interbirth intervals increased with age. Using an operational definition of termination of reproduction based on individual variance in interbirth intervals, a proportion of females in most nonhuman species had terminated reproduction before death. Compared to other primates, a greater proportion of chimpanzees and human females ceased reproduction, and humans, in particular, were reproductively inactive for relatively longer than would be expected from their body weight. These empirical data quantify the extent of reproductive termination and thereby extend hitherto anecdotal accounts of this phenomenon in primates.},

The current study was undertaken to test two evolutionary theories: (a) the reproductive system maximizes the number of offspring in response to positive environmental cues in terms of energy balance, and (b) early puberty is a trade-off response for high mortality rate and reduced resource availability.MethodsUsing a sample of 22 natural-fertility societies of mostly tropical foragers, horticulturalists, and pastoralists from Africa, South America, Australia, and Southeastern Asia, this study compares indices of adolescence growth and menarche with those of fertility fitness in these non-industrial, traditional societies.ResultsThe average age at menarche correlated with the first reproduction, but did not correlate with the total fertility rate TFR or reproductive fitness. The age at menarche correlated negatively with their average adult body mass, and the average adult body weight positively correlated with reproductive fitness. Survivorship did not correlate with the age at menarche or age indices of the adolescent growth spurt. The population density correlated positively with the age at first reproduction, but not with menarche age, TFR, or reproductive fitness.ConclusionsBased on our analyses, we reject the working hypotheses that reproductive fitness is enhanced in societies with early puberty or that early menarche is an adaptive response to greater mortality risk. Whereas body mass is a measure of resources is tightly associated with fitness, the age of menarche is not.},

Perimenopause, the transition leading to and surrounding menopause, has biological and psychosociocultural features. Midlife women may be concerned about physically distressing symptoms, mood changes of uncertain origin, or adult-developmental issues that become entwined with perimenopause. A careful individualized assessment is important, and psychotherapists should address physical experiences along with the psychological interpretations and sociocultural experiences that influence meaning and coping strategies. Responses to uncertainty, negative attitudes toward aging and menopause, and catastrophizing self-statements may be important.},

 abstract = {The field of microbiome research is arguably one of the fastest growing in biology. Bacteria feature prominently in studies on animal health, but fungi appear to be the more prominent functional symbionts for plants. Despite the similarities in the ecological organization and evolutionary importance of animal-bacterial and plant-fungal microbiomes, there is a general failure across disciplines to integrate the advances made in each system. Researchers studying bacterial symbionts in animals benefit from greater access to efficient sequencing pipelines and taxonomic reference databases, perhaps due to high medical and veterinary interest. However, researchers studying plant-fungal symbionts benefit from the relative tractability of fungi under laboratory conditions and ease of cultivation. Thus each system has strengths to offer, but both suffer from the lack of a common conceptual framework. We argue that community ecology best illuminates complex species interactions across space and time. In this synthesis we compare and contrast the animal-bacterial and plant-fungal microbiomes using six core theories in community ecology (i.e., succession, community assembly, metacommunities, multi-trophic interactions, disturbance, restoration). The examples and questions raised are meant to spark discussion amongst biologists and lead to the integration of these two systems, as well as more informative, manipulatory experiments on microbiomes research. },

 abstract = {The peopling, origins, and early prehistory of the Americas are topics of intense debate. However, few studies have used human remains to document and interpret patterns of health and lifestyle of Paleoamericans. This study provides the first investigation to characterize oral health in a series of early Holocene skeletal remains from Lagoa Santa, Brazil, a locality containing the remains of some of the earliest inhabitants of South America (10,000-7,000 BP). The sample is composed of 949 teeth and 1925 alveoli from an estimated 113 individuals excavated from 17 archaeological sites located in the State of Minas Gerais. We compare dental caries and abscess prevalence at Lagoa Santa to a large sample of human skeletons from the Western Hemisphere Project (WHP) database using both individual and tooth/alveolus count methods. In addition, antemortem tooth loss and tooth wear were analyzed in Lagoa Santa by sex and age. The results show that Lagoa Santa dental caries and abscess prevalence are significantly higher than observed among other hunter-gatherers included in the WHP database, except when abscess prevalence is considered by individual count. Adult females have less tooth wear coupled with higher prevalence of dental caries and antemortem tooth loss than adult males. These results point to an unexpected record of poor oral health at Lagoa Santa, especially among females. A diet based on a highly cariogenic combination of wild tubers and fruits is suggested as an explanation for the elevated rate, characterizing an early adaptation to a tropical environment in South America.},

Ethnic diversity is particularly high in the South, where the Nilo-Saharan Nyangatom and the Afro-Asiatic Daasanach dwell. Despite their linguistic differentiation, both populations rely on a similar agripastoralist mode of subsistence. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from Nyangatom and Daasanach archival sera revealed high levels of diversity, with most sequences belonging to the L haplogroups, the basal branches of the mitochondrial phylogeny. However, in sharp contrast with other Ethiopian populations, only 5% of the Nyangatom and Daasanach sequences belong to haplogroups M and N. The Nyangatom and Daasanach were found to be significantly differentiated, while each of them displays close affinities with some Tanzanian populations. The strong genetic structure found over East Africa was neither associated with geography nor with language, a result confirmed by the analysis of 6711 HVS-I sequences of 136 populations mainly from Africa. Processes of migration, language shift and group absorption are documented by linguists and ethnographers for the Nyangatom and Daasanach, thus pointing to the probably transient and plastic nature of these ethnic groups. These processes, associated with periods of isolation, could explain the high diversity and strong genetic structure found in East Africa.},

Three recent books bring together a number of these criticisms, based on cross-cultural studies of children in diverse environments as well as an historical analysis of how attachment theory was created and sustained over time. The two cross-cultural books (Attachment Reconsidered, edited by Naomi Quinn and Jeannette Mageo, and Different Faces of Attachment, edited by Hiltrud Otto and Heidi Keller) include ethnographic observations of how infants and young children are cared for in many non-Western societies, as well as research on children's behavior in attachment-related situations. Common themes include multiple caregiving, maternal responsiveness, and autonomy versus relatedness, viewed from evolutionary, cross-cultural, and developmental perspectives. Marga Vicedo's historical study (The Nature and Nurture of Love) offers a scholarly account of the creators of attachment theory and the social-historical context of its development. Based on detailed documentation of the intellectual careers of these people, those who influenced them and those who criticized them, Vicedo builds an argument that attachment theory is not as scientifically solid as has been claimed, and that its core ideas are ultimately damaging to mothers. Taken as a whole, these books suggest seven observations on the current “strange situation” of attachment theory, which are summarized at the conclusion of the review.},

Yet, our ability to visualize and understand this diversity is limited by the ways it has been documented and shared: on a culture-by-culture basis, in locally-told stories or difficult-to-access repositories. In this paper we introduce D-PLACE, the Database of Places, Language, Culture, and Environment. This expandable and open-access database (accessible at https://d-place.org) brings together a dispersed corpus of information on the geography, language, culture, and environment of over 1400 human societies. We aim to enable researchers to investigate the extent to which patterns in cultural diversity are shaped by different forces, including shared history, demographics, migration/diffusion, cultural innovations, and environmental and ecological conditions. We detail how D-PLACE helps to overcome four common barriers to understanding these forces: i) location of relevant cultural data, (ii) linking data from distinct sources using diverse ethnonyms, (iii) variable time and place foci for data, and (iv) spatial and historical dependencies among cultural groups that present challenges for analysis. D-PLACE facilitates the visualisation of relationships among cultural groups and between people and their environments, with results downloadable as tables, on a map, or on a linguistic tree. We also describe how D-PLACE can be used for exploratory, predictive, and evolutionary analyses of cultural diversity by a range of users, from members of the worldwide public interested in contrasting their own cultural practices with those of other societies, to researchers using large-scale computational phylogenetic analyses to study cultural evolution. In summary, we hope that D-PLACE will enable new lines of investigation into the major drivers of cultural change and global patterns of cultural diversity. },

 abstract = {Human reproductive patterns have been well studied, but the mechanisms by which physiology, ecology and existing kin interact to affect the life history need quantification. Here, we create a model to investigate how age-specific interbirth intervals adapt to environmental and intrinsic mortality, and how birth patterns can be shaped by competition and help between siblings. The model provides a flexible framework for studying the processes underlying human reproductive scheduling. We developed a state-based optimality model to determine age-dependent and family-dependent sets of reproductive strategies, including the state of the mother and her offspring. We parameterized the model with realistic mortality curves derived from five human populations. Overall, optimal birth intervals increase until the age of 30 after which they remain relatively constant until the end of the reproductive lifespan. Offspring helping each other does not have much effect on birth intervals. Increasing infant and senescent mortality in different populations decreases interbirth intervals. We show that sibling competition and infant mortality interact to lengthen interbirth intervals. In lower-mortality populations, intense sibling competition pushes births further apart. Varying the adult risk of mortality alone has no effect on birth intervals between populations; competition between offspring drives the differences in birth intervals only when infant mortality is low. These results are relevant to understanding the demographic transition, because our model predicts that sibling competition becomes an important determinant of optimal interbirth intervals only when mortality is low, as in post-transition societies. We do not predict that these effects alone can select for menopause. },

Prospective studies indicate that the gut microbiota composition during the first months of life influences allergy development, and support the theory that factors influencing the early maturation of the immune system might be important for subsequent allergic disease. However, recent research indicates that microbial exposure during pregnancy may be even more important for the preventative effects against allergic disease. This review gives a background of the epidemiology, immunology, and microbiology literature in this field. It focuses on possible underlying mechanisms such as immune-regulated epigenetic imprinting and bacterial translocation during pregnancy, potentially providing the offspring with a pioneer microbiome. We suggest that a possible reason for the initial exposure of bacterial molecular patterns to the fetus in utero is to prime the immune system and/or the epithelium to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensals after birth.},

 abstract = {The hygiene hypothesis postulates that higher levels of cleanliness and improper exposure to microorganisms early in childhood could disturb the intestinal microbiome resulting in abnormal immune responses. Recently, more attention has been put on how a lack of sun exposure and consequently vitamin D deficiency could lead to less immune tolerance and aberrant immune responses. Moreover, vitamin D receptor (VDR) function has been positioned to be a critical aspect of immune response and gut homeostasis. Therefore, this review focuses on the role that the interaction between vitamin D, VDR function, and gut microbiome might have on autoimmune diseases in the context of the hygiene hypothesis. Literature shows that there is a high correlation between vitamin D deficiency, VDR dysfunction, gut microbiota composition, and autoimmune diseases. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, serves as the primary ligand for VDRs, which have been shown to play a fundamental role in reducing autoimmune disease symptoms. Although the biological functions of VDR, the effects of its genetic variants, and the effects of epigenetic profiles in its promoter region are largely unknown in humans, studies in murine models are increasingly demonstrating that VDRs play a crucial role in attenuating autoimmune disease symptoms by regulating autophagy and the production of antimicrobial peptides, such cathelicidin and β-defensin, which are responsible for modifying the intestinal microbiota to a healthier composition. Remarkably, evidence shows that hormonal compounds and byproducts of the microbiota such as secondary bile acids might also activate VDR. Therefore, understanding the interaction between VDR and gut microbiota is of the utmost importance toward understanding the rise in autoimmune diseases in Western countries. We have gained insights on how the VDR functions affects inflammation, autophagy, and microbiota composition that could lead to the development of pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, while confirming the role vitamin D and VDRs have in the context of hygiene hypothesis.},

 abstract = { The Iron Age transition in sub-Saharan Africa represents a time when the relationship between humans and their environment was fundamentally altered at near-continental scale. This alteration may have had widespread consequences for regional climate, hydrology, biodiversity and ecosystem services that persist to the present. Quantification of these impacts and potential feedbacks is difficult, however, because the archaeological and historical record is highly fragmented in time and space. Here, we present a classification of human subsistence in Iron Age Africa from 1000BC to AD1500 that illustrates the various degrees of land use intensity employed by different groups at different times. The classification is based on a broad synthesis of archaeological, archaeobotanical, and ethnographic observations. The primary goal of our classification is to employ it as input to quantitative models of human–environment interactions to test hypotheses on the importance of humans for the development of African environments over the late Holocene.},

 abstract = {Middle Stone Age (MSA) shellfish remains were studied for indications of changes in subsistence adaptations. Optimal Foraging Theory was applied to the MSA shellfish species from Blombos Cave and Klasies River, South Africa, to model which shellfish would be most profitable to collect in terms of meat yield and handling costs. This ranking is compared to the composition of the archaeological shellfish assemblages. Several developments are considered to be the result of changes in prey choice. It appears that at Klasies River, MSA people mainly collected high ranked mid-intertidal shellfish, and that their foraging strategy was strongly influenced by changes in the coastal environment. At Blombos Cave, when the sea was further from the cave, a revaluation of the prey ranking caused an increase in Perna perna densities in the M2 and M1 phases, compared to the older M3 phase. P. perna was not only selected because, as a bivalve it preserves better during transport, but also because it can easily be mass collected. At Blombos Cave there are changes in species representation and a decrease in average Turbo sarmaticus opercula weight. This tentatively suggests that shellfish collection may have intensified during later phases. In general, MSA collecting trips were optimized according to the available shellfish, taking into account the distance to the resource and their yield.},

Here, we present a formal simulation in which life spans similar to those of modern chimpanzees lengthen into the modern human range as a consequence of grandmother effects. Greater longevity raises the chance of living through the fertile years but is opposed by costs that differ for the sexes. Our grandmother assumptions are restrictive. Only females who are no longer fertile themselves are eligible, and female fertility extends to age 45 years. Initially, there are very few eligible grandmothers and effects are small. Grandmothers can support only one dependent at a time and do not care selectively for their daughters' offspring. They must take the oldest juveniles still relying on mothers; and infants under the age of 2 years are never eligible for subsidy. Our model includes no assumptions about brains, learning or pair bonds. Grandmother effects alone are sufficient to propel the doubling of life spans in less than sixty thousand years.},

 abstract = {Although human bitter taste perception is hypothesized to be a dietary adaptation, little is known about genetic signatures of selection and patterns of bitter taste perception variability in ethnically diverse populations with different diets, particularly from Africa. To better understand the genetic basis and evolutionary history of bitter taste sensitivity, we sequenced a 2,975 bp region encompassing TAS2R38, a bitter taste receptor gene, in 611 Africans from 57 populations in West Central and East Africa with diverse subsistence patterns, as well as in a comparative sample of 132 non-Africans. We also examined the association between genetic variability at this locus and threshold levels of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) bitterness in 463 Africans from the above populations to determine how variation influences bitter taste perception. Here, we report striking patterns of variation at TAS2R38, including a significant excess of novel rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms that recently arose only in Africa, high frequencies of haplotypes in Africa associated with intermediate bitter taste sensitivity, a remarkably similar frequency of common haplotypes across genetically and culturally distinct Africans, and an ancient coalescence time of common variation in global populations. Additionally, several of the rare nonsynonymous substitutions significantly modified levels of PTC bitter taste sensitivity in diverse Africans. While ancient balancing selection likely maintained common haplotype variation across global populations, we suggest that recent selection pressures may have also resulted in the unusually high level of rare nonsynonymous variants in Africa, implying a complex model of selection at the TAS2R38 locus in African populations. Furthermore, the distribution of common haplotypes in Africa is not correlated with diet, raising the possibility that common variation may be under selection due to their role in nondietary biological processes. In addition, our data indicate that novel rare mutations contribute to the phenotypic variance of PTC sensitivity, illustrating the influence of rare variation on a common trait, as well as the relatively recent evolution of functionally diverse alleles at this locus.},

Kazakhstan is still characterized by a pyramid shaped age distribution of its population and by a high incidence of not communicable diseases and lack of nutrient and micronutrients, especially among children. However, the population of Kazakhstan seems to be not immune to the diseases of the modernization. I.e., among women obesity is more frequent than underweight, especially in the urban areas. In rural populations the frequency of clinically relevant hypertension resulted low in the more isolated and traditionally living communities but it increased to 20% in the less isolated one. Although it is expected a strong increase of urbanized population in the next 25 years, currently, modernization is probably influencing life style and nutritional habits of almost only a minority of the inhabitants of Kazakhstan.},

This study uses time allocation, ethnographic, dietary, and anthropometric data collected with 96 urban Mexican shantytown children (aged 8-12 years) and their older and younger siblings (aged 1-18 years) to test hypotheses related to the effects of children's cash earning and cash contributions to their households for their own and their sibs' nutritional status. Regression models show that children's contributions to household income and the time they allocate to working outside the home makes no difference to their own or their younger siblings' nutritional status assessed anthropometrically. Dietary quality, based on food recalls, is worse in working than non-working children, even taking household income into account. Children's allocation of time to work and their cash contributions to the household do however significantly improve the weight of their older siblings, especially sisters. This suggests children's work in urban ecologies might have different constraints and opportunities for their own and siblings' growth and nutrition than typically observed in subsistence settings.},

 abstract = {Models of social evolution and the evolution of helping have been classified in numerous ways. Two categorical differences have, however, escaped attention in the field. Models tend not to justify why they use a particular assumption structure about who helps whom: a large number of authors model peer-to-peer cooperation of essentially identical individuals, probably for reasons of mathematical convenience; others are inspired by particular cooperatively breeding species, and tend to assume unidirectional help where subordinates help a dominant breed more efficiently. Choices regarding what the help achieves (i.e. which life-history trait of the helped individual is improved) are similarly made without much comment: fecundity benefits are much more commonly modelled than survival enhancements, despite evidence that these may interact when the helped individual can perform life-history reallocations (load-lightening and related phenomena). We review our current theoretical understanding of effects revealed when explicitly asking 'who helps whom to achieve what', from models of mutual aid in partnerships to the very few models that explicitly contrast the strength of selection to help enhance another individual's fecundity or survival. As a result of idiosyncratic modelling choices in contemporary literature, including the varying degree to which demographic consequences are made explicit, there is surprisingly little agreement on what types of help are predicted to evolve most easily. We outline promising future directions to fill this gap. },

 abstract = {Biomechanical analyses of past populations have primarily focused on adults and interpreted variation in limb bone robusticity as indicative of differences in behavior. However, prior to skeletal maturity large changes occur in limb bone robusticity and shape. During ontogeny, the accrual of bone is regulated by differences in genetics and nutrition as well as mechanical loading. We consider how long bone robusticity changes from birth to young adulthood in order to understand when population differences appear during development and why this occurs.We analyzed the femoral and humeral midshafts of four prehistoric hunter-gatherer skeletal samples from four regions: Cis-Baikal, Siberia, Point Hope, Alaska, the central Japanese coast, and the South African Cape. Some statistically significant differences between populations manifest at birth or soon after. Some of this systemic patterning likely reflects adaptation of body shape to climate. Later Stone Age South Africans also appear to demonstrate low limb rigidity residuals as a result of growth towards a unique body type. Differentiation between populations also increases with age, pointing to functional adaptation as a result of behavioral differences. This proves largely concordant with other lines of evidence for differing levels of terrestrial and aquatic mobility in these populations.},

 abstract = {Why do women cease fertility rather abruptly through menopause at an age well before generalized senescence renders child rearing biologically impossible? The two main evolutionary hypotheses are that menopause serves either (i) to protect mothers from rising age-specific maternal mortality risks, thereby protecting their highly dependent younger children from death if the mother dies or (ii) to provide post-reproductive grandmothers who enhance their inclusive fitness by helping to care and provide for their daughters' children. Recent theoretical work indicates that both factors together are necessary if menopause is to provide an evolutionary advantage. However, these ideas need to be tested using detailed data from actual human life histories lived under reasonably 'natural' conditions; for obvious reasons, such data are extremely scarce. We here describe a study based on a remarkably complete dataset from The Gambia. The data provided quantitative estimates for key parameters for the theoretical model, which were then used to assess the actual effects on fitness. Empirically based numerical analysis of this nature is essential if the enigma of menopause is to be explained satisfactorily in evolutionary terms. Our results point to the distinctive (and perhaps unique) role of menopause in human evolution and provide important support for the hypothesized evolutionary significance of grandmothers.},

 abstract = {Because humans have slow life histories, discussions of the optimal age at first birth have stressed the benefits of delayed reproduction. However, given the diversity of ecological, fertility, and mortality environments in which humans live, reproductive maturity is expected to be highly variable. This article uses reproductive histories to examine a pattern of early menarche and first birth among the Pume, a group of South American foragers. Age at menarche and first birth are constructed using both retrospective and cross-sectional data for females over the age of 10 (n = 83). The objectives are first to define these patterns and then discuss their reproductive consequences. On average, Pume girls reach menarche at age 12.9, and give birth to their first child at age 15.3-15.5 (retrospective and cross-sectional data, respectively). This populational average falls several years prior to what often is considered the human norm. Two questions are then considered. What are the infant mortality costs across a mother's reproductive career? How does surviving fertility vary with age at first birth? Results indicate that the youngest of first-time mothers (<14) are four times more likely to loose their firstborns than older first-time mothers (> or =17). Given parity-specific mortality rates, the optimal strategy to minimize infant mortality and maximize reproductive span is to initiate childbearing in the midteens. Women gain no additional advantage in surviving fertility by delaying childbearing until their late teens.},

Jerison expanded Lashley's views in key respects. First, he postulated that brain size is a natural biological statistic that can be readily used to estimate other anatomical characteristics of the brain including the size of other neural structures, the degree of fissurization, and neuronal density. He recognized, however, one major exception to this rule – the size of the olfactory bulbs appears to have little relationship to that of other brain structures. Second, Jerison articulated the principle of proper mass – ‘the mass of neural tissue controlling a particular function is appropriate to the amount of information processing involved in performing the function.’ (Jerison, 1973, p. 8). Third, Jerison recognized that brain mass varies with body mass, and he developed a model of brain/body size relationships according to which, with increasing body size, brain size expands in a mathematically predictable way in each vertebrate class.},

We tested the hypothesis that in a semi-free ranging colony of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), the death of a non-alpha matriarch, who had a large set of kin, would lead to changes in behavior and physiological stress within her matriline. Following her death, her matriline increased in aggression, vigilance, and social grooming. Additionally, hierarchical stability, measured by levels of rank changes, decreased within her matriline, and levels of intense aggression by high-ranking animals were more frequent, as well as matrilineal wounding. Although ordinal rank was positively associated with higher chronic hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) in the months before the matriarch's death, following her death, only those who experienced large increases in rank within her matriline displayed higher HCCs. Changes in matrilineal stability, aggression, behavior, and HCCs within the other two matrilines in the troop were not evident, although caution is needed due to the small sample sizes. We conclude that the death of the non-alpha matriarch led to matrilineal instability, characterized by higher levels of aggression and subsequent vigilance, rank changes, physiological stress, and grooming. We suggest that non-alpha matriarchs with a large number of kin and social support can be integral to the stability of matrilines. },

 abstract = {The analysis of fertility in colonizing populations is of great interest, since its individuals experience a major environmental change, and fertility rates can reflect the level of adaptation of the population to its new conditions. Using Northrop's genealogical compilations, this paper examines the fertility pattern of California's early Spanish-Mexican colonists between 1742 and 1876, their fitness levels and their trend across time throughout the colonizing period. A total of 197 women from 599 compiled families who had completed their reproductive period and had at least one child were analysed. The correlations among variables were also analysed in order to infer the relationship between longevity and fertility, and the influence of fertility determinants. The results show a natural fertility pattern, with a very young age at marriage and birth of first child (17.2 and 19.1 years respectively), and also a young age at last childbirth (38.8 years). The population's fitness showed greater values than for contemporary European populations, with 8 of 9.2 children surviving to adulthood, in comparison with 55% of newborns in Finland for the same period, suggesting a good adaptation of the population to their new environmental conditions. No relationship between fertility and lifespan was observed, as has been reported by other authors and in opposition to classical theories. A temporal trend in the number of children, consisting of three different phases, was observed, in accordance with the stability of living conditions in the region. },

In contrast, couples with children and childless couples did not differ in caretaking of parents.

 abstract = {While the 'immigrant health paradox' posits better health behaviours and outcomes for immigrants upon arrival to the US, research suggests that this advantage may deteriorate over time. This study analysed the relationship of acculturation and breast-feeding initiation and duration among a sample of predominantly Latina, low-income women in the US. The four measures of acculturation included: mother's nativity (foreign born vs US born), mother's parents' nativity (foreign born vs US born), years of US residence (<8 years vs > or =8 years) and a dichotomous measure of language acculturation adapted from three items on Marin's acculturation scale (preferred language spoken at home, reading language and writing language) as exclusive use of native language versus non-exclusive use (mixed or English only) (Marin et al., 1987; Marin & Gamba, 1996). Final multivariable models showed that mothers who exclusively used their native language were more likely to initiate breast-feeding as well as breast-feed for longer duration compared with mothers with non-exclusive use, whereas years of US residence and mother's nativity were not significantly associated with breast-feeding initiation or duration. Mother's parents' nativity also emerged as a significant predictor of breast-feeding duration, both within final models for immigrants and across study participants. Programmes providing nutrition education to low-income women may wish to consider the role of language as an important determinant of breast-feeding. The role of mother's parents' nativity on breast-feeding practices deserves exploration in future studies, as the cultural practices taught by family members born outside the US may exert strong pressure within immigrant families now living in the US.},

Acute alcohol consumption affects ratings of physical attractiveness and also attenuates aspects of visual perception. We tested the hypothesis that increases in ratings of attractiveness associated with alcohol intoxication can be attributed at least in part to a reduced ability to discern facial asymmetry due to reductions in levels of visual perception. We examined whether alcohol intoxication reduces ability to detect asymmetry in approximately symmetrical images. Sober and intoxicated subjects were shown a series of simple geometric images to which they responded on whether they perceived each one to be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Intoxicated subjects were significantly less able to detect asymmetry than were sober subjects, providing support for the hypothesis.},

It is relatively common among some cultures, such as the Aka and Efé hunter-gatherers of the Congo Basin, but it does not occur in other foragers such as the !Kung and Hadza of Southern and East Africa. This paper utilizes focal follow observations of Aka and Efé infants, interviews with Aka mothers, ethnographic reports from researchers working with hunter-gatherers, and a survey of the eHRAF cultures to try to answer the following questions: how often does allomaternal nursing occur, who provides it, and under what contexts does it take place? The study indicates that it occurs in many cultures (93% of cultures with data) but that it is normative in relatively few cultures; biological kin, especially grandmothers, frequently provide allomaternal nursing and that infant age, mother's condition, and culture (e.g., cultural models about if and when women other than the mother can nurse an infant or colostrum taboos) impact the nature and frequency of allomaternal nursing. The empirical results of this exploratory study are discussed in the context of existing hypotheses used to explain allomaternal nursing.},

 abstract = {The proposal that all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) types in contemporary humans stem from a common ancestor present in an African population some 200,000 years ago has attracted much attention. To study this proposal further, two hypervariable segments of mtDNA were sequenced from 189 people of diverse geographic origin, including 121 native Africans. Geographic specificity was observed in that identical mtDNA types are shared within but not between populations. A tree relating these mtDNA sequences to one another and to a chimpanzee sequence has many deep branches leading exclusively to African mtDNAs. An African origin for human mtDNA is supported by two statistical tests. With the use of the chimpanzee and human sequences to calibrate the rate of mtDNA evolution, the age of the common human mtDNA ancestor is placed between 166,000 and 249,000 years. These results thus support and extend the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.},

In a report published online in Science this week, the team has found that Africans are descended from 14 ancestral populations, which often correlate with language and cultural groups. They found that all hunter-gatherers and pygmies in Africa today shared ancestors 35,000 years ago and that East Africa was the source of the great migration that populated the rest of the world. They also found that African-American individuals, on average, have mixed ancestry from all over western Africa, which will make it difficult to trace roots to specific ethnic groups. },

Women's fertility is determined in large part at birth. They are born with their total number of ovarian follicles, for example, which normally influences the age at which menopause begins. But in the 1990s, researchers proposed that if a child's energy is depleted by malnutrition, disease, or other factors, he or she would be less fertile as an adult. By using the natural experiment of migration, researchers demonstrated in a talk at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists meeting how differences during childhood do indeed alter the course of reproduction in adult women.

In the current study, we collected observational data to investigate predictors of the quality of grandmother-grandchild interactions in Zambia. Data were collected from 46 grandmothers and their 12 to 27-month-old infant grandchildren. The results revealed that grandmothers with fewer children and those who enjoyed the grandparenting tasks more were more sensitive in their interactions with their grandchildren. Unexpectedly, parenting beliefs favoring sensitive parenting predicted lower observed sensitivity in grandmothers. Further, grandmothers with a more individualistic cultural orientation were more intrusive toward their grandchildren. The results underscore the importance of time and emotional resources as predictors of sensitive parenting among grandmothers.},

Focus group participants suggested that weaning patterns are strongly influenced by seasonal factors, and individual mothers often stated an intention to introduce adult staple foods and terminate breastfeeding at the end of the long rains. However, a combination of maternal self-perception, assessment of infant well-being, and indicators of household food supply influenced the actual progression of weaning for individual children. The results suggest that interventions to promote exclusive breastfeeding and improve complementary feeding practices in rural East African pastoral populations could build on maternal attention to infant-centered cues and address household-level constraints on caregivers making decisions about young child feeding.},

 abstract = {The Plainview/Folsom-aged bison Bonebed 2 at Bonfire Shelter, originally excavated in the 1960s, is argued to be the earliest North American bison jump (Dibble 1970; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Yet, it is far older than all other known jumps, and well south of where the great majority of these sites are found. Dibble (1970) reasonably argued that its age and location was not compelling evidence against it being a bison jump. However, Binford (1978) observed that the skeletal composition of Bonebed 2 did not resemble a kill. To assess whether Bonfire Shelter could have been utilized as a jump and whether it was, we explore two lines of evidence bearing on the issue, a GIS analysis of the site and upland topography, and zooarchaeological analysis of the recovered bison remains. Although our GIS analysis indicates that Bonfire Shelter meets many of the criteria of a jump locality, our reanalysis of the faunal remains suggests this was not the primary kill locus, but instead a processing area to which high-utility portions of at least 24 bison were transported and butchered. Where the bison were killed, and how, is not known.
Résumé Se ha planteado que el Nivel de Huesos 2 del sitio de Bonfire Shelter, que es de la época de Plainview/Folsom, es el sitio norteamericano más antiguo donde se llevó a cabo el método de caída para la matanza de bisontes (Dibble 1970; Dibble y Lorrain 1968). Sin embargo, es mucho más antiguo que todos los otros sitios de caída que se conocen hasta la fecha, y está ubicado muy al sur de donde se encuentra la gran mayoría de tales sitios. Dibble (1970) planteó razonablemente que su antigüedad y ubicación no forman evidencia convincente de que no fuera una caída de bisontes. A pesar de esto, Binford (1978) observó que la composición esquelética del Nivel de Huesos 2 no parece ser de una matanza. Para investigar si Bonfire Shelter pudo haberse usado como sitio de caída, exploramos en el presente informe dos tipos de evidencia que tienen que ver con el problema: un análisis GIS del sitio y la topografía de terreno elevado, y un análisis zooarqueológico de los restos recuperados de los bisontes. A pesar de que nuestro análisis abarca muchos de los criterios para una localidad de caída, nuestro reanálisis de los restos de la fauna sugiere que ésta no fue la localidad primaria de la matanza, sino quefue una área de procesamiento a la cual se trasladaron y destazaron las porciones de alta utilidad de los 24 bisontes. No se sabe dónde y cómo se mataron los bisontes.},

 abstract = {Little information concerning the nutritional status of Brazilian Indians living primitively in a large area of the Amazon region is available at present. This study took place in the Xingu National Park, created to preserve the Indian population living in this area, along with its culture. Field work was done in three consecutive years (1974, 1975, 1976). At the end of this period 175 children had been studied (97 male and 78 female) all estimated to be under 5 yr of age. Two kinds of studies were performed: 1) cross-sectional: studying the children that entered in the nutritional survey every year, and 2) longitudinal: studying the children that were under observation for 2 or 3 consecutive yr. The nutritional status was evaluated by two age-independent anthropometric indices, namely, weight-for-height and arm-circumference-for-height. The weight-for-height index showed that 96.0% of the children examined were classified as well nourished, 3.4% suffered of 1st degree malnutrition and 0.6% of 2nd degree malnutrition. The arm-circumference-for-height revealed that 97.1% were well nourished and 2.9% were classified as suffering of a mild degree of malnutrition. Since both indices used can give normal results in a population in which there is severe stunting or nutritional dwarfism, a longitudinal study was drawn. Growth in height was studied, resulting normal in 84.8% of the measurements taken. In contrast to children from low income families living in the outskirts of large urban centers where malnutrition reaches 54.0%, the Indians remain as healthy as they were when last examined 30 yr ago.},

 abstract = {Among the human health conditions linked to microbial communities, phenotypes are often associated with only a subset of strains within causal microbial groups. Although it has been critical for decades in microbial physiology to characterize individual strains, this has been challenging when using culture-independent high-throughput metagenomics. We introduce StrainPhlAn, a novel metagenomic strain identification approach, and apply it to characterize the genetic structure of thousands of strains from more than 125 species in more than 1500 gut metagenomes drawn from populations spanning North and South American, European, Asian, and African countries. The method relies on per-sample dominant sequence variant reconstruction within species-specific marker genes. It identified primarily subject-specific strain variants (&lt;5% inter-subject strain sharing), and we determined that a single strain typically dominated each species and was retained over time (for &gt;70% of species). Microbial population structure was correlated in several distinct ways with the geographic structure of the host population. In some cases, discrete subspecies (e.g., for <i>Eubacterium rectale</i> and <i>Prevotella copri</i>) or continuous microbial genetic variations (e.g., for <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>) were associated with geographically distinct human populations, whereas few strains occurred in multiple unrelated cohorts. We further estimated the genetic variability of gut microbes, with <i>Bacteroides</i> species appearing remarkably consistent (0.45% median number of nucleotide variants between strains), whereas <i>P. copri</i> was among the most plastic gut colonizers. We thus characterize here the population genetics of previously inaccessible intestinal microbes, providing a comprehensive strain-level genetic overview of the gut microbial diversity.},

 abstract = {Metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome have only recently begun to explore the differences in taxonomic composition between subjects from diverse geographical origins. Here, we compared taxonomy, resistome and functional metabolic properties of publicly available shotgun datasets of human fecal samples collected from different geographical regions (Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania). Such datasets encompassed gut microbiota information corresponding to 13 developed/industrialized societies, as well as two traditional hunter-gatherer, pre-agricultural communities (Tanzanian and Peruvian individuals). Assessment of the retrieved taxonomic profiles allowed the most updated reconstruction of the global core-microbiome as based on currently available data, as well as the identification and targeted genome reconstruction of bacterial taxa that appear to have been lost and/or acquired during urbanization/industrialization. Functional characterization of these metagenomic datasets indicates that the urbanization/industrialization process which occurred in recent human history has shaped the gut microbiota through the acquisition and/or loss of specific gut microbes, thereby potentially impacting on the overall functionality of the gut microbiome.},

Faecal and blood samples of 10 mice were collected at: (1) - basal, (2) - after 21days of industrial bread intake and (3) - after another 21days of celta bread exposure. Significant differences in the gut microbiota composition were detected after the consumption of both breads, whereas the celta bread increased the concentration of Akkermansia and Mucispirillum, the industrial bread favour the Bacteroidetes proliferation and additionally systemic inflammation. In conclusion, the more consumed industrial processed bread might provoke systemic inflammation, probably in relation with its composition and manufacture process.},

 abstract = {Bedrock ground stone features are ubiquitous along the canyons of the Chaquaqua Plateau in southeastern Colorado, U.S.A, however, we know very little about their distribution, function or relationship to the regional archaeology. While some argue that prehistoric inhabitants of southeastern Colorado constructed permanent milling spaces to process local food resources, others think they may have processed corn. Most assume they were used by groups of women to process food resources together. Recent research suggests that the bedrock ground stone features differ depending on where they occur on the landscape, but may also vary because of socio-cultural ideals, as yet unknown. Sub-features are used as heuristic categories to discuss ways in which bedrock ground stone features are indicative of social processes such as group work or social reproduction of knowledge through collective labor. In this paper, we use close-range photogrammetry to examine the use of the sub-feature category as a means to refine the archaeology of bedrock ground stone surfaces in the region. Results illustrate that CRP offers an objective means to critically analyze the relationship of ground stone surfaces on bedrock features.},

On the other hand, Western societies suffer from the downsides of the elevated standard of living. Among other factors, the Western diet (poor in dietary fiber), lack of contact with natural biodiversity, and excessive antibiotic use are known to be associated with the increase in chronic inflammatory disorders. Limited exposure to microbial biodiversity, in combination with severe lifestyle-related disturbances to commensal microbial communities, especially during early life, is changing the diversity and composition of human microbiota. In this review, we try to promote and apply ecological theory to understand the dynamics and diversity of human commensal microbiota. In this context, we explore the changes in the microbiota that are relevant to human health, especially in light of the rise of chronic inflammatory disorders. We try to elucidate the underlying ecological mechanisms behind these disorders and provide potential solutions for their avoidance.},

 abstract = {This review focuses on the current evidence that maternal dietary and gut bacterial exposures during pregnancy influence the developing fetal immune system and subsequent offspring asthma. Part 1 addresses exposure to a farm environment, antibiotics, and prebiotic and probiotic supplementation that together indicate the importance of bacterial experience in immune programming and offspring asthma. Part 2 outlines proposed mechanisms to explain these associations including bacterial exposure of the fetoplacental unit; immunoglobulin-related transplacental transport of gut bacterial components; cytokine signaling producing fetomaternal immune alignment; and immune programming <i>via</i> metabolites produced by gut bacteria. Part 3 focuses on the interplay between diet, gut bacteria, and bacterial metabolites. Maternal diet influences fecal bacterial composition, with dietary microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) selecting short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Current evidence from mouse models indicates an association between increased maternal dietary MACs, SCFA exposure during pregnancy, and reduced offspring asthma that is, at least in part, mediated by the induction of regulatory T lymphocytes in the fetal lung. Part 4 discusses considerations for future studies investigating maternal diet-by-microbiome determinants of offspring asthma including the challenge of measuring dietary MAC intake; limitations of the existing measures of the gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity; measures of SCFA exposure; and the complexities of childhood respiratory health assessment.},

 abstract = {Fast-evolving MHC class I polymorphism serves to diversify NK cell and CD8 T cell responses in individuals, families, and populations. Because only chimpanzee and bonobo have strict orthologs of all <i>HLA class I</i>, their study gives unique perspectives on the human condition. We defined polymorphism of <i>Papa-B</i>, the bonobo ortholog of <i>HLA-B</i>, for six wild bonobo populations. Sequences for <i>Papa-B</i> exon 2 and 3 were determined from the genomic DNA in 255 fecal samples, minimally representing 110 individuals. Twenty-two <i>Papa-B</i> alleles were defined, each encoding a different Papa-B protein. No Papa-B is identical to any chimpanzee Patr-B, human HLA-B, or gorilla Gogo-B. Phylogenetic analysis identified a clade of MHC-B, defined by residues 45-74 of the α<sub>1</sub> domain, which is broadly conserved among bonobo, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Bonobo populations have 3-14 Papa-B allotypes. Three Papa-B are in all populations, and they are each of a different functional type: allotypes having the Bw4 epitope recognized by killer cell Ig-like receptors of NK cells, allotypes having the C1 epitope also recognized by killer cell Ig-like receptors, and allotypes having neither epitope. For population Malebo, these three Papa-B are the only Papa-B allotypes. Although small in number, their sequence divergence is such that the nucleotide diversity (mean proportional distance) of <i>Papa-B</i> in Malebo is greater than in the other populations and is also greater than expected for random combinations of three <i>Papa-B</i> Overall, <i>Papa-B</i> has substantially less diversity than <i>Patr-B</i> in chimpanzee subspecies and <i>HLA-B</i> in indigenous human populations, consistent with bonobo having experienced narrower population bottlenecks.},

This question reflects one of the most long-standing debates on the universality versus culture-specificity of caregiver-infant interactions in general and sensitive responsiveness to infants in particular. In this article, an integration of both points of view is presented, based on the theoretical origins of the sensitive responsiveness construct combined with the ethnographic literature on caregivers and infants in different parts of the world. This integration advocates universality without uniformity, and calls for multidisciplinary collaborations to investigate the complexities and nuances of caregiver-infant interactions in different cultures. Salient issues are illustrated with observations of infants (ages 7-31 months) in Mali, the Republic of Congo, and the Philippines.},

The bacterial community in human milk contained over 26 phylum, 157 family and 543 different genera. Comparison of urban and rural milk microbiota revealed that they differ in both i) highly abundant taxa, including Proteobacteria (P =0.008) and Firmicutes (P =0.046), and ii) overall microbial diversity (Shannon index, P <0.001). Despite of huge variation in microbial community structure, metabolic pathways were more stable and evenly distributed between urban and rural community. In concert, the study provided first insights into human milk microbial community of Indian population and demonstrated that different lifestyle can rapidly altered milk microbiota.},

 abstract = {Biological significance of food components suggests that preferences for basic tastes should be similar across cultures. On the other hand, cultural factors play an important role in diet and can consequently influence individual preference for food. To date, very few studies have compared basic tastes preferences among populations of very diverse environmental and cultural conditions, and research rather did not involve traditional populations for whom the biological significance of different food components might be the most pronounced. Hence, our study focused on basic taste preferences in three populations, covering a broad difference in diet due to environmental and cultural conditions, market availability, dietary habits and food acquirement: 1) a modern society (Poles, n = 200), 2) forager-horticulturalists from Amazon/Bolivia (Tsimane', n = 138), and 3) hunter-gatherers from Tanzania (Hadza, n = 85). The preferences for basic tastes were measured with sprays containing supra-threshold levels of sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami taste solutions. We observed several interesting differences between participating societies. We found that Tsimane' and Polish participants liked the sweet taste more than other tastes, while Hadza participants liked salty and sour tastes more than the remaining tastes. Further, Polish people found bitter taste particularly aversive, which was not observed in the traditional societies. Interestingly, no cross-cultural differences were observed for relative liking of umami taste - it was rated closely to neutral by members of all participating societies. Additionally, Hadza showed a pattern to like basic tastes that are more common to their current diet than societies with access to different food sources. These findings demonstrate the impact of diet and market availability on preference for basic tastes.},

 abstract = {The aims of this paper is threefold: 1) to explore the spatial and temporal variations in age-at-death profiles of human remains from Southern Patagonia in order to test and discuss the hypothetical increasing demography during the late Holocene; 2) to evaluate probable biases in the skeletal samples derived from preservation issues, social organization features and/or mortuary behavior, and 3) to compare the results with those reported for other hunter-gatherer societies from Pampa and Patagonia regions, offering valuable insights about the age-at-death profiles and paleodemographic for other Southern South American hunter-gatherers with different social characteristics. Age-at-death profiles from Southern Patagonia below 50°S, corresponding to the middle-late Holocene (i.e., after ca. 5500 years before present -YBP-), were constructed from a skeletal series of 119 individuals. Sex and age distribution of the entire sample was firstly analyzed, and two other age-at-death profiles were thereafter built, dividing the sample by region (Santa Cruz/Magellan, Northern Tierra del Fuego and Southern Tierra del Fuego) and by chronology (5500–3500 YBP, 3500–1000 YBP, 1000–400 YBP and after 400 YBP). The results show an attritional profile with two peaks, the first one between 1.1 and 10 years-old and the other for the 20.1–35 age group. A low number of newborns younger than 1 year-old is observed. This could be the result of a low mortality rate for this age interval and a high parental care during the first period of childhood, although taphonomical and mortuary biases cannot be completely excluded. Adult males and females are similarly represented in each age category. Juvenile Index data are higher than 0.17 between 5500 and 400 YBP periods, suggesting population growth, with a particular demographic increase between 5500–3500 and 1000–400 YBP periods. During the contact period, fertility is dramatically reduced. The age-at-death profile is similar to other hunter-gatherer past populations from Pampa and Patagonia regions. Despite the differences regarding mobility strategies, social organization, demographic dynamics and mortuary behavior known for those societies, all profiles show a comparable bimodal attritional pattern, although some variation in the most represented age-groups and demographic growth is observed.},

 abstract = {The overall goal of this paper is to derive a set of generalizations that might characterize children as tool makers/users in the earliest human societies. These generalizations will be sought from the collective wisdom of four distinct bodies of scholarship: lithic archaeology; juvenile chimps as novice tool users; recent laboratory work in human infant and child cognition, focused on objects becoming tools and; the ethnographic study of children learning their community’s tool-kit. The presumption is that this collective wisdom will yield greater insight into children’s development as tool producers and users than has been available to scholars operating within narrower disciplinary limits.},

 abstract = {Food systems primary goal should be to nourish human beings. And yet, the current industrial food system, with its profit-maximising ethos, is not achieving that goal despite producing food in excess. On the contrary, this system is the main driver of malnutrition on the planet, as well as environmental degradation. Nonetheless, food systems also play a double role as Nature's steward. Deciding which role we want food systems to play will very much depend on the idea we have about food. What is food for humans? The dominant narrative of the industrial food system undeniably considers food as a tradeable commodity whose value is mostly determined by its price. This narrative was crafted and disseminated initially by academics, who largely favoured one option (commodification of food) over the others (food as commons or public good). In this research, the author aims to understand how academia has explored the value-based considerations of food as commodity and private good (hegemonic narratives) compared to considerations of food as commons and public good (alternative narratives). A systematic literature review of academic papers since 1900 has been carried out with Google Scholar™, using different searching terms related to “food + commons”, “food + commodity”, “food + public good” and “food + private good”. Following the PRISMA methodology to clean the sample, a content analysis has been carried out with the 70 references including “food + commons” and “food + public good”. Results clearly show that both topics are very marginal subjects in the academic milieu (only 179 results before cleaning) but with a sharp increase in the eight years that followed the 2008 food crisis. On the contrary, “food + commodity” presents almost 50,000 references since 1900 (before cleaning), with a remarkable increase since the 1980s, coincidental with the dominance of neoliberal doctrines. The phenomenological approach to food (epitomised in the “food as” searching term) largely prevails over the ontological approach to food (“food is”) except when food is identified as a “private good”. This result points to the ontological absolute ”food is a private good” developed by the economic scholars as a dominant narrative that locked other valuations of food by legal, political or historical scholars or non-scientific epistemologies. In a world where the industrial food system has clearly proven its unfitness to feed us adequately in a sustainable way, the need for academia to explore other food valuations seems more urgent than ever. Scholars need to approach other narratives of food (as commons or public good) that go beyond the hegemonic and permitted ideas, unlocking unexplored food policy options to guarantee universal access to food for all humans, regardless their purchasing power, without mortgaging the viability of our planet.},

 abstract = {The origins of complex projectile weaponry provides insight into cultural and biological changes associated with the origins and spread of modern human populations. Middle Stone Age backed pieces are often thought to be components of such armaments, however our limited understanding of their functional characteristics as projectiles precludes understanding the adaptive problems they may have solved. Despite acknowledgment of raw material differences and intra-assemblage variability, whether variability in backed piece form reflects functional, economic, or stylistic variation has a paucity of empirical support. Here, the functional differences in backed piece form (size and shape) while hafted transversely and obliquely as high-velocity complex projectile armatures are examined. If there are performance tradeoffs simply in how backed pieces are arranged at the end of armaments that can influence effectiveness, then identifying the archaeological arrangement can provide insight into what variables were being prioritized in prehistoric technological systems. How variation in backed piece size, elongation, and hafting arrangement influences complex projectile performance is tested using experimental and actualistic projectile replications with a calibrated crossbow against animal and ballistics gelatin targets. The results of this study show that, within the size and shape variation of silcrete backed pieces examined, tool form plays a relatively limited role in their performance as projectile armatures. However, hafting orientation has very different performance characteristics for complex projectiles shot at ballistics gelatin compared to animal targets. We demonstrate that transversely hafted tools have more lethal internal wounds, but obliquely hafted backed pieces have greater puncture reliability. These functional differences represent different technological design emphasis: transversely hafted tools create large, deep wounds, while obliquely hafted arrows and darts create a puncture more reliably. Although obliquely hafted armaments cause less internal trauma, they are more likely to penetrate the hide of ungulate prey. Variability in MSA hunting tactics may have played a role in the design of weapon systems to optimize these performance tradeoffs. Despite similarities in shape with ethno-historic technologies, based on these results, MSA-sized backed pieces hafted as projectile armatures were unlikely to have been used with small, low-powered bows - but would have been lethal with a high-velocity delivery system.},

 abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in host development, metabolism, and health. To date, few longitudinal studies have investigated the causes and consequences of microbiota variation in wildlife, although such studies provide a comparative context for interpreting the adaptive significance of findings from studies on humans or captive animals. Here, we investigate the impact of seasonality, diet, group membership, sex, age, and reproductive state on gut microbiota composition in a wild population of group-living, frugi-folivorous primates, Verreaux's sifakas (<i>Propithecus verreauxi</i>). We repeatedly sampled 32 individually recognizable animals from eight adjacent groups over the course of two different climatic seasons. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the microbiota composition of 187 fecal samples. We demonstrate a clear pattern of seasonal variation in the intestinal microbiota, especially affecting the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be driven by seasonal differences in diet. The relative abundances of certain polysaccharide-fermenting taxa, for example, Lachnospiraceae, were correlated with fruit and fiber consumption. Additionally, group membership influenced microbiota composition independent of season, but further studies are needed to determine whether this pattern is driven by group divergences in diet, social contacts, or genetic factors. In accordance with findings in other wild mammals and primates with seasonally fluctuating food availability, we demonstrate seasonal variation in the microbiota of wild Verreaux's sifakas, which may be driven by food availability. This study adds to mounting evidence that variation in the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the ability of primates to cope with seasonal variation in food availability.},

The demands associated with living in complex social groups have been the favored explanation for the evolution of primate cognition in general and human cognition in particular. However, recent comparative research indicates that ecological variation can also shape cognitive abilities. I synthesize the emerging evidence that 'foraging cognition' - skills used to exploit food resources, including spatial memory, decision-making, and inhibitory control - varies adaptively across primates. These findings provide a new framework for the evolution of human cognition, given our species' dependence on costly, high-value food resources. Understanding the origins of the human mind will require an integrative theory accounting for how humans are unique in both our sociality and our ecology.},

Further, the collective genomes of gut microbiota (microbiome) contain 100~150-fold more genes than the human genome. The gut microbiota has coevolved with humans and has shown profound effects on various host responses. Recent findings have suggested that an altered gut microbial composition is associated with metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These findings indicate that the gut microbiota should be considered as an important factor to modulate host metabolism and metabolic disorders. If we could understand the alterations of the gut microbiota, in combination with dietary patterns, this might provide insights into how the gut microbiota contributes to disease progression and whether it could be a potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target.},

The current study investigated the effects of well-characterized butyrate-producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum CGMCC0313.1 (CB0313.1) on hyperglycemia and associated metabolic dysfunction in two diabetic mouse models. CB0313.1 was administered daily by oral gavage to leptindb/db mice for 5 weeks starting from 3 weeks of age, and to HF diabetic mice induced by high fat diet (HFD) plus streptozotocin (STZ) in C57BL/6J mice for 13 weeks starting from 4 weeks of age. CB0313.1 improved diabetic markers (fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, GLP-1 and insulin secretion), and decreased blood lipids and inflammatory tone. Furthermore, CB0313.1 reversed hypohepatias and reduced glucose output. We also found that CB0313.1 modulated gut microbiota composition, characterized by a decreased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, reduced Allobaculum bacteria that were abundant in HF diabetic mice and increased butyrate-producing bacteria. Changes in gut microbiota following CB0313.1 treatment were associated with enhanced peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), insulin signaling molecules and mitochondrial function markers. Together, our study suggests that CB0313.1 may act as a beneficial probiotic for the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia and associated metabolic dysfunction.},

Indeed, roles for the bacterial commensals in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as depression, autism, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, are emerging. Microbiota dysregulation has been documented in all of these conditions or in animal models thereof. Moreover, depletion or modulation of the gut microbiota can affect the severity of the central pathology or behavioral deficits observed in a variety of brain disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are only slowly being unraveled.

The symbiotic relationship between different gut microbial communities regulates the immune system and, therefore, any dysbiosis can dysregulate the immune system.

 abstract = {BackgroundSpace travel is associated with continuous low dose rate exposure to high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. Pathophysiological manifestations after low dose radiation exposure are strongly influenced by non-cytocidal radiation effects, including changes in the microbiome and host gene expression. Although the importance of the gut microbiome in the maintenance of human health is well established, little is known about the role of radiation in altering the microbiome during deep-space travel.ResultsUsing a mouse model for exposure to high LET radiation, we observed substantial changes in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiome. These were accompanied by changes in the abundance of multiple metabolites, which were related to the enzymatic activity of the predicted metagenome by means of metabolic network modeling. There was a complex dynamic in microbial and metabolic composition at different radiation doses, suggestive of transient, dose-dependent interactions between microbial ecology and signals from the host’s cellular damage repair processes. The observed radiation-induced changes in microbiota diversity and composition were analyzed at the functional level. A constitutive change in activity was found for several pathways dominated by microbiome-specific enzymatic reactions like carbohydrate digestion and absorption and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, while the activity in other radiation-responsive pathways like phosphatidylinositol signaling could be linked to dose-dependent changes in the abundance of specific taxa.ConclusionsThe implication of microbiome-mediated pathophysiology after low dose ionizing radiation may be an unappreciated biologic hazard of space travel and deserves experimental validation. This study provides a conceptual and analytical basis of further investigations to increase our understanding of the chronic effects of space radiation on human health, and points to potential new targets for intervention in adverse radiation effects.},

 abstract = {The influence of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms on human gut health and disease is still largely unexplored. Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the gut, but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled. We have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets, comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and lifestyle. We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization. These findings, along with the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive association with any of the disease considered, and decreased presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer and Crohn's disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally, we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3 and ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance population genomics of human parasites.},

Local communities mainly utilize the leaves, pulp, and seeds of baobab as a source of food and for income generation. The present study was conducted to determine the nutritive attributes of baobab fruit pulp and seeds across provenances in east, west, and southern Africa and to determine whether the nutrient content varied with the provenance of origin. Pulp and seed proximate composition and mineral element concentration were determined using the AOAC 1984 methods and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), respectively. The results showed that there exist significant variation (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) in pulp moisture, protein, fiber, ash, and elemental content among provenances. The highest mean pulp crude fiber (8.68 g 100 g<sup>-1</sup> dw) was recorded in Kenya. At country level, Malawi had the highest mean pulp potassium (22.2 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), calcium (4,300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), magnesium (2,300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), sodium (1,000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and phosphorus (1,100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) levels. Kenya had the highest mean pulp iron (57.4 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) and manganese (27.2 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) content, while Mali had the lowest iron (13.1 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) and manganese (8.6 μg g<sup>-1</sup>). At country level, the mean seed calcium content was highest (3,200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in Malawi and lowest (2,000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in Kenya. The highest mean iron content of 63.7 μg g<sup>-1</sup> was recorded in seeds from Kenya, while the lowest (25.8 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) was in Mali. Baobab seed mineral and proximate content varied significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) among the selected countries. Overall, baobab fruit pulp and seeds contain significant amounts of nutritionally essential minerals and proximate components but the amounts varied significantly among the selected countries. This variation offers opportunities for selecting provenances to concentrate on during germplasm collection for conservation and domestication of baobab.},

Bacterial diversity was high in the first days of life, and was dominated by the genus Prevotella. Then, it rapidly decreased and remained low up to D28 when the gut flora was composed almost exclusively of strictly anaerobic bacteria. Each infant's fecal bacterial microbiota composition was significantly closer to that of their mother than to that of any other woman in the mothers' group, suggesting an intrauterine, placental or amniotic fluid origin of such bacteria. Moreover, bacterial communities differed according to the delivery mode. Overall, the bacterial microbiota communities displayed a similar diversification and expansion in newborns within and between countries during the first four weeks of life. Moreover, six of the fifteen infants of this study harbored enteric viruses (rotavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) in fecal samples, but never in the meconium. A maternal source for the viruses detected at D02 and D07 can be excluded because none of them was found also in the child's mother. These findings improve our knowledge on the gut bacterial and viral communities of infants from two Sub-Saharan countries during their first month of life.},

 abstract = {For hominins living in the Paleolithic era, early food antigen exposures-<i>in utero</i> and throughout infancy-closely matched later exposures, and therefore immune system tolerance mechanisms evolved under the expectation of this condition being met. This predicts that the degree of mismatch between early and downstream food antigen exposures is a key variable underlying the development of childhood food allergies. Three historical periods are identified in which the degree of mismatch climbs from near zero to substantial, as we transition from one period to another. The first encompasses our long history as foragers; the second begins with the advent of farming and the third spans only the most recent two or three decades, and manifests from social changes driven largely by an explosion in access to information. Testable predictions are generated and evaluated in light of available evidence, and an approach for primary prevention of childhood food allergies is proposed.},

 abstract = {The symbiotic relationship between the host and its gut microbiota has evolved to benefit both parties, especially by maintaining the host health and providing nutrients to the microbiota. Until recently, the study of this complex relationship was limited to culture-based studies. For this purpose, functional metagenomics has proved to be a powerful technique for exploring the diversity of the microbiota, discovering new functions and signaling pathways and extending our knowledge in the cross talk between the host and its gut microbiota. By assigning functions to proteins without any a priori knowledge of their sequences, the activity-based metagenomic approach allows to rationalize the sequencing efforts, to boost enzyme discovery, and to obtain knowledge on their mode of action, from the molecular to the ecosystem scales. This review offers an overview of the recent results obtained by activity-based metagenomic approach on the exploration of the human gut microbiota and gives insights on future developments and promising discoveries in the field.},

It is estimated through HMP metagenomic sequencing and analysis that human beings harbor 10 times more bacteria than cells in their bodies. The intestine is the body's largest immune organ. The gut microbiome is in constant crosstalk with the host immune system and plays a paramount role in immune system development, immune regulation, and immune responses. Inflammation is the natural immune reaction in the body against any environmental stimuli and plays a major role in the healing process. Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the harvest, storage, and expenditure of energy obtained from the diet. Diet has a major role to play in the occurrence of noncommunicable diseases. The role of the gut microbiome in brain functions like cognition and behavior is being increasingly appreciated and has been suggested to begin during the fetal stage.},

 abstract = {The manipulation of fire is a technological act. The identification of the archaeological signatures of the controlled use of fire has important implications not only for the estimations of the origins and functions of the first fireplaces but also for our understanding of prehistoric technological development and resource use. At Riwi (Kimberley region, Western Australia), excavations over two field seasons have revealed a discontinuous occupation sequence over the past 45 ka, showing numerous, different combustion features interspersed within the deposit. Anthracological and micromorphological investigations at Riwi Cave indicate that the combustion features at the site can be categorised into three types: flat combustion features (type A), dug combustion features (type B) and thick accumulations of mixed combustion residues (type C). These provide evidence for two kinds of combustion practice: (i) fires lit directly on the ground and most likely not re-used and (ii) ground ovens, the latter appearing some 10,000 years after the first evidence for occupation of the site. A comparison of the wood species identified within these combustion features with those from equivalent scattered context levels, enables an exploration of the potential factors influencing wood selection and fire use through time at the site. A detailed understanding of the relationship between wood charcoal remains and archaeological context yields significant information on changes to environmental context and site occupation patterns over time.},

 abstract = {Long-term exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been connected to chronic human health disorders. It is also well-known that i) PAH contamination alters soil bacterial communities, ii) human microbiome is associated with environmental microbiome, and iii) alteration in the abundance of members in several bacterial phyla is associated with adverse or beneficial human health effects. We hypothesized that soil pollution by PAHs altered soil bacterial communities that had known associations with human health. The rationale behind our study was to increase understanding and potentially facilitate reconsidering factors that lead to health disorders in areas characterized by PAH contamination. Large containers filled with either spruce forest soil, pine forest soil, peat, or glacial sand were left to incubate or contaminated with creosote. Biological degradation of PAHs was monitored using GC-MS, and the bacterial community composition was analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. Proteobacteria had higher and Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes had lower relative abundance in creosote contaminated soils than in non-contaminated soils. Earlier studies have demonstrated that an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes are particularly associated with adverse health outcomes and immunological disorders. Therefore, we propose that pollution-induced shifts in natural soil bacterial community, like in PAH-polluted areas, can contribute to the prevalence of chronic diseases. We encourage studies that simultaneously address the classic "adverse toxin effect" paradigm and our novel "altered environmental microbiome" hypothesis.},

Various hypotheses have been used to explain the disappearance of Neanderthals from Eurasia. However, very few studies have explicitly examined the causative role of demography on Neanderthal and anatomically modern humans (AMH) interaction. Here we use an integrative method based on computational modelling and the analysis of archaeological data to construct an agent based model that explores the influence of demographic variables (birth and death rates) and mobility (home range size) on the bio-cultural interaction between AMH and Neanderthals during the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic on the Iberian Peninsula (50 ka to 30 ka BP). Our simulation results are consistent with the current radiocarbon framework for the disappearance of Neanderthals in this region. This suggest that the extinction of Neanderthals could be explained by inter-specific differences in demographic behaviour and mobility patterns compared with AMH.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). A metagenomic approach and network analysis were used to establish a comprehensive antibiotic resistome catalog and to obtain co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and microbial taxa in fecal samples from 180 healthy individuals from 11 different countries. In total, 507 ARG subtypes belonging to 20 ARG types were detected with abundances ranging from 7.12 × 10<sup>-7</sup> to 2.72 × 10<sup>-1</sup> copy of ARG/copy of 16S-rRNA gene. Tetracycline, multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, bacitracin, vancomycin, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the top seven most abundant ARG types. The multidrug ABC transporter, aadE, bacA, acrB, tetM, tetW, vanR and vanS were shared by all 180 individuals, suggesting their common occurrence in the human gut. Compared to populations from the other 10 countries, the Chinese population harboured the most abundant ARGs. Moreover, LEfSe analysis suggested that the MLS resistance type and its subtype 'ermF' were representative ARGs of the Chinese population. Antibiotic inactivation, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic efflux were the dominant resistance mechanism categories in all populations. Procrustes analysis revealed that microbial phylogeny structured the antibiotic resistome. Co-occurrence patterns obtained via network analysis implied that 12 species might be potential hosts of 58 ARG subtypes.},

We compare the results to previously published data from a nearby contemporary site, CA-CCO-548. Data show that, on average, children were weaned earlier at CA-SJO-112, but unlike at CA-CCO-548, boys and girls were eating similar types of foods and overall dietary composition was more homogenous among all children at CA-SJO-112. These differences suggest alternative parental investment strategies at the two sites, perhaps due to greater sharing and communal foraging at CA-SJO-112. Combined with low apparent infant mortality rates and similar rates of stress, as measured by rates of linear enamel hypoplasia, earlier weaning at CA-SJO-112 has important implications for population growth in the region.},

One possibility is that these daily fluctuations in sleep are caused by the underlying genotype of the individual. However, differences attributable to genetic causes are difficult to distinguish from environmental factors in outbred populations such as humans. We therefore employed Drosophila as a model of intra-individual variability in sleep using previously collected sleep and activity data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a collection of wild-derived inbred lines. Individual flies had significant daily fluctuations in their sleep patterns, and these fluctuations were heritable. Using the standard deviation of sleep parameters as a metric, we conducted a genome-wide association study. We found 663 polymorphisms in 104 genes associated with daily fluctuations in sleep. We confirmed the effects of 12 candidate genes on the standard deviation of sleep parameters. Our results suggest that daily fluctuations in sleep patterns are due in part to gene activity.},

En el primero se observa una tendencia a la difuminación de las diferencias sociales y, en el segundo, se nota una distinción en función del grupo de edad y género. Tras el cambio climático y de patrones de asentamiento en el paso del Gravetiense al Magdaleniense y Epigravetiense, se percibe que, hasta cierto punto, las formas en que se inhumaban los diversos sectores sociales se tornaron más homogéneas. Pero, reconociendo constantes, se concluye que las concepciones paleolíticas de la muerte conformaron un fenómeno de larga duración en el que, pese a la existencia de modificaciones superficiales, pudieron mantenerse una serie de elementos más centrales.   Based on a comparative analysis of archaeological burial contexts and rock art in the European Upper Palaeolithic, this paper suggests two main forms of mortuary practices for that period: one aimed at the disposal and eventual disintegration of the dead, and another focused on their preservation and retention. The earlier reveals an intention to disguise social differences, the latter, on the contrary, seems to represent an effort to singularize the gender and age-group of the deceased. It appears that, following the changes in climate and settlement patterns that took place after the Gravettian and into the Magdalenian and Epigravettian, the burial forms and practices pertaining to different social groups became more homogeneous, to some extent. However, we identify some continuous trends which lead us to conclude that the Paleolithic idea of death may be perceived as a long-term phenomenon that, despite superficial transformations, maintained some basic elements at its core.},

Particularly understudied is the effect of secular changes in physical activity on child development. We address these shortcomings using data spanning the transition from traditional to semi-developed economy among Yucatec Maya agriculturalists. Anthropometric and behavioral observation data were collected from children living in a subsistence-based rural community in 1992 and again in 2012 following the introduction of a school and mechanized technologies but minimal overt dietary change. Multiple regression analyses demonstrate dramatic twenty-year transformations in how children spent their time. This behavioral change was associated with large declines in estimated physical activity level (PAL), associated activity energy expenditure savings of several hundred kilocalories/day, and sizable increases in mean height, weight, and triceps skinfold thickness. Controlling for observed frequency of market food consumption, PAL was inversely related to child body size and subcutaneous fat stores and significantly mediated the effects of data collection year on anthropometric indices. These findings indicate that physical activity can considerably influence childhood growth, highlighting the role of energy allocation tradeoffs between physical activity and competing life tasks in shaping patterns of human ontogeny and health.},

The X-linked grandmother hypothesis posits that differential X-chromosome relatedness between grandmothers and their grandchildren is a leading driver of differential grandchild survival between grandmother lineages and grandchild sexes. We tested this hypothesis using time-event models on a large, multigenerational dataset from pre-industrial Finland. We found that the presence of an MGM increases grandson survival more than PGM presence, and that granddaughter survival is higher than that of grandsons in the presence of a PGM. However, there was no support for the key prediction that the presence of PGMs improves granddaughter survival more than that of MGMs, diminishing the overall support for the hypothesis.

It is defined as the ratio between the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> quantity received during the maximum allowed outdoor exposure without erythema risk and the target value. Sunbathing is safe for HOEI&gt;1 and 1/HOEI represents a part of minimal erythema dose (MED) necessary to obtain the target value. We examine the following targets: a vitamin D<sub>3</sub> quantity equivalent to 1000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> taken orally, and an optimal vitamin D<sub>3</sub> quantity defined by Krzyścin et al. (2016). The biologically weighted (previtamin D<sub>3</sub> and erythemal) doses from the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudinal stations are analyzed to find HOEI dependence on personal and meteorological factors. HOEI depends mostly on the exposed skin area, person's age, and sun elevation at noon but not on the Fitzpatrick skin phototype. We found that only young adults (&lt;21 yr) could safely obtain vitamin D<sub>3</sub> quantity, which is equivalent to 1000 IU taken orally, almost throughout the whole year. Duration of such exposures appears &lt;1 h only in the warm subperiods of the year (April-September) for a person with minimal erythema dose of 330 J m<sup>-2</sup>. Exposing larger part of the body (~30%) enables the oldest persons (&gt;59 yr) to reach 1000 IU target during warm days in spring and summer. The optimal daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> quantity could only be synthesized only by young adults for about 40-60% of days in the May-August period if they expose at least 1/3 part of their body surface area. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation seems to be necessary over the whole year for the oldest persons with daily dosage of ~2000 IU but reduced to ~1000 IU in summer for sunseekers exposing significant part of the body.},

Also, more participatory polities were less likely to commit atrocities in the course of internal warfare.

                    This study demonstrates regional comparisons are important because they help us evaluate the generalizability of worldwide findings. Additionally, adding atrocities to the study of democracy and warfare is new and suggests reduced atrocities as an additional benefit of political participation.

 abstract = {Key PointsThe inheritance of identical haplotypes from a common ancestor creates long tracts of homozygous genotypes known as runs of homozygosity (ROH).ROH are ubiquitous across human populations, and they correlate with pedigree inbreeding. Larger populations have fewer, shorter ROH, whereas isolated or bottlenecked populations have more, somewhat longer ROH. Admixed groups have the fewest ROH, whereas consanguineous communities carry very long ROH. Native American populations have the highest burdens of ROH in the world.ROH can be detected in microarray or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, using either observational approaches, for example, that implemented in PLINK, or model-based approaches. Simulations show that PLINK outperforms many other methods.ROH are non-randomly distributed across the genome, being more prevalent in areas of low recombination, but are also concentrated in small regions called ROH islands.Quantitative traits related to stature and cognition have been robustly associated with ROH burden, implying recessive variants contribute to their genetic architecture. Case–control analyses of ROH, on the other hand, appear more easily confounded by socioeconomic or cultural factors.Both megacohorts and special populations are now being used to investigate diverse aspects of the scope and mechanism of inbreeding depression in humans.},

 abstract = {Previous studies indicated that populations consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in fiber, vegetables, and fruits have a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases than populations of industrialized societies consuming diets enriched in processed carbohydrates, animal proteins, and fats. To explore the potential contributions of gut microbiota to the observed diet-related metabolic effects, we conducted an integrative analysis of distal gut microbiota composition and functions and intestinal metabolites in Egyptian and U.S. teenagers. All Egyptian gut microbial communities belonged to the <i>Prevotella</i> enterotype, whereas all but one of the U.S. samples were of the <i>Bacteroides</i> enterotype. The intestinal environment of Egyptians was characterized by higher levels of short-chain fatty acids, a higher prevalence of microbial polysaccharide degradation-encoding genes, and a higher proportion of several polysaccharide-degrading genera. Egyptian gut microbiota also appeared to be under heavier bacteriophage pressure. In contrast, the gut environment of U.S. children was rich in amino acids and lipid metabolism-associated compounds; contained more microbial genes encoding protein degradation, vitamin biosynthesis, and iron acquisition pathways; and was enriched in several protein- and starch-degrading genera. Levels of 1-methylhistamine, a biomarker of allergic response, were elevated in U.S. guts, as were the abundances of members of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>, two genera with recognized anti-inflammatory effects. The revealed corroborating differences in fecal microbiota structure and functions and metabolite profiles between Egyptian and U.S. teenagers are consistent with the nutrient variation between Mediterranean and Western diets. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The human gastrointestinal microbiota functions as an important mediator of diet for host metabolism. To evaluate how consumed diets influence the gut environment, we carried out simultaneous interrogations of distal gut microbiota and metabolites in samples from healthy children in Egypt and the United States. While Egyptian children consumed a Mediterranean diet rich in plant foods, U.S. children consumed a Western diet high in animal protein, fats, and highly processed carbohydrates. Consistent with the consumed diets, Egyptian gut samples were enriched in polysaccharide-degrading microbes and end products of polysaccharide fermentation and U.S. gut samples were enriched in proteolytic microbes and end products of protein and fat metabolism. Thus, the intestinal microbiota might be selected on the basis of the diets that we consume, which can open opportunities to affect gut health through modulation of gut microbiota with dietary supplementations.},

 abstract = {A species has a post-reproductive stage if, like humans, a female entering the adult population can expect to live a substantial proportion of their life after their last reproductive event. However, it is conceptually and statistically challenging to distinguish these true post-reproductive stages from the usual processes of senescence, which can result in females occasionally surviving past their last reproductive event. Hence, despite considerable interest, the taxonomic prevalence of post-reproductive stages remains unclear and debated. In this study we use life tables constructed from published data on wild populations of mammals, and statistical measures of post-reproductive lifespans, to distinguish true post-reproductive stages from artefacts of senescence and demography in 52 species. We find post-reproductive stages are rare in mammals and are limited to humans and a few species of toothed whales. By resolving this long-standing debate, we hope to provide clarity for researchers in the field of evolutionary biology and a solid foundation for further studies investigating the evolution and adaptive significance of this unusual life history trait.},

 abstract = {Summary  Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in gut bacteria can hydrolyze conjugated bile salts to unconjugated bile acids and amino acids. Thereby play a crucially important role in host health by reducing serum cholesterol levels, preserving bile acids balance and regulating various metabolism as signaling molecules. Here we present the taxonomic identification of BSHs in human microbiota and elucidate the abundance and activity differences of various bacterial BSHs among 11 different populations. For the first time, we have revealed BSH are distributed in 154 intestinal bacterial strains within 33 genera in human microbiota. However, these BSHs present obviously differentiation for the sequence identity being from 28.6% to 100%, and the 32.7% bacteria strains having more than one paralogs of BSHs with dissimilarity. Therefore, we reclassified the BSHs from the different genera into 6 phylotypes basing on their phylogenetic tree, and demonstrate the significant abundance patterns of BSH phylotypes among different populations. From the enzyme activity comparison, the representative sequence of BSH-T3 was shown highest enzyme activity in 6 phylotypes. Meanwhile, BSH-T3 sequences which all distributed in Lactobacillus show highest abundance in Chinese and Austrian. The information illustrated by this study is useful for investigating the population differences of bile acid metabolism related diseases, and further giving a new suggestion on selection of probiotics or development of pharmaceutical proteins based upon the activity of BSH phylotypes to regulate host metabolism and maintain fitness. },

 abstract = {Researchers have recently proposed that "moralistic" religions-those with moral doctrines, moralistic supernatural punishment, and lower emphasis on ritual-emerged as an effect of greater wealth and material security. One interpretation appeals to life history theory, predicting that individuals with "slow life history" strategies will be more attracted to moralistic traditions as a means to judge those with "fast life history" strategies. As we had reservations about the validity of this application of life history theory, we tested these predictions with a data set consisting of 592 individuals from eight diverse societies. Our sample includes individuals from a wide range of traditions, including world religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, but also local traditions rooted in beliefs in animism, ancestor worship, and worship of spirits associated with nature. We first test for the presence of associations between material security, years of formal education, and reproductive success. Consistent with popular life history predictions, we find evidence that material security and education are associated with reduced reproduction. Building on this, we then test whether or not these demographic factors predict the moral concern, punitiveness, attributed knowledge-breadth, and frequency of ritual devotions towards two deities in each society. Here, we find no reliable evidence of a relationship between number of children, material security, or formal education and the individual-level religious beliefs and behaviors. We conclude with a discussion of why life-history theory is an inadequate interpretation for the emergence of factors typifying the moralistic traditions.},

We also demonstrate the utility of the living data resource and cross-cohort comparison to confirm existing associations between the microbiome and psychiatric illness, and to reveal the extent of microbiome change within one individual during surgery, providing a paradigm for open microbiome research and education.  Importance We show that a citizen-science, self-selected cohort shipping samples through the mail at room temperature recaptures many known microbiome results from clinically collected cohorts and reveals new ones.

 abstract = {The functions of human NK cells in defense against pathogens and placental development during reproduction are modulated by interactions of killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) with HLA-A, -B and -C class I ligands. Both receptors and ligands are highly polymorphic and exhibit extensive differences between human populations. Indigenous to southern Africa are the KhoeSan, the most ancient group of modern human populations, who have highest genomic diversity worldwide. We studied two KhoeSan populations, the Nama pastoralists and the ≠Khomani San hunter-gatherers. Comprehensive next-generation sequence analysis of <i>HLA-A</i>, <i>-B</i>, and <i>-C</i> and all <i>KIR</i> genes identified 248 different <i>KIR</i> and 137 <i>HLA class I</i>, which assort into ∼200 haplotypes for each gene family. All 74 Nama and 78 ≠Khomani San studied have different genotypes. Numerous novel <i>KIR</i> alleles were identified, including three arising by intergenic recombination. On average, KhoeSan individuals have seven to eight pairs of interacting KIR and HLA class I ligands, the highest diversity and divergence of polymorphic NK cell receptors and ligands observed to date. In this context of high genetic diversity, both the Nama and the ≠Khomani San have an unusually conserved, centromeric <i>KIR</i> haplotype that has arisen to high frequency and is different in the two KhoeSan populations. Distinguishing these haplotypes are independent mutations in <i>KIR2DL1</i>, which both prevent KIR2DL1 from functioning as an inhibitory receptor for C2<sup>+</sup> HLA-C. The relatively high frequency of C2<sup>+</sup> HLA-C in the Nama and the ≠Khomani San appears to have led to natural selection against strong inhibitory C2-specific KIR.},

Current theoretical approaches and research methods are limited in their ability to capture this complexity. We draw on insights from a predictive coding account of neural activity and a grounded cognition account of concept representation to conceive of emotion perception as a stream of synchronized conceptualizations between two individuals, which is supported and shaped by language. We articulate how this framework can illuminate the fundamental need to study culture, as well as other sources of conceptual variation, in unpacking conceptual synchrony in emotion. We close by suggesting that the conceptual system provides the necessary flexibility to overcome gaps in emotional synchrony.},

These include analyses of the interplay of light and materials in natural scenes, to the genetic, neural, and cognitive processes underlying color sensitivity and percepts. The basic model for color vision, where the light spectrum is first sampled by receptors and then represented in opponent mechanisms, remains a cornerstone of color theory. However, the ways in which these processes are manifest and operate are surprisingly varied and still poorly understood. New developments continue to reveal that color vision involves highly flexible coding schemes that support sophisticated perceptual inferences. Characterizing these processes is providing fundamental insights not only into our experience of color, but into perception and neural coding generally.},

 abstract = {The ecology of Neanderthals is a pressing question in the study of hominin evolution. Diet appears to have played a prominent role in their adaptation to Eurasia. Based on isotope and zooarchaeological studies, Neanderthal diet has been reconstructed as heavily meat-based and generally similar across different environments. This image persists, despite recent studies suggesting more plant use and more variation. However, we have only a fragmentary picture of their dietary ecology, and how it may have varied among habitats, because we lack broad and environmentally representative information about their use of plants and other foods. To address the problem, we examined the plant microremains in Neanderthal dental calculus from five archaeological sites representing a variety of environments from the northern Balkans, and the western, central and eastern Mediterranean. The recovered microremains revealed the consumption of a variety of non-animal foods, including starchy plants. Using a modeling approach, we explored the relationships among microremains and environment, while controlling for chronology. In the process, we compared the effectiveness of various diversity metrics and their shortcomings for studying microbotanical remains, which are often morphologically redundant for identification. We developed Minimum Botanical Units as a new way of estimating how many plant types or parts are present in a microbotanical sample. In contrast to some previous work, we found no evidence that plant use is confined to the southern-most areas of Neanderthal distribution. Although interpreting the ecogeographic variation is limited by the incomplete preservation of dietary microremains, it is clear that plant exploitation was a widespread and deeply rooted Neanderthal subsistence strategy, even if they were predominately game hunters. Given the limited dietary variation across Neanderthal range in time and space in both plant and animal food exploitation, we argue that vegetal consumption was a feature of a generally static dietary niche.},

 abstract = {This study investigated categorical perception for unique hues in order to establish a relationship between color appearance, color discrimination, and low-level (second-stage) mechanisms. We tested whether pure red, yellow, green, and blue, (unique hues) coincide with troughs, and their transitions (binary hues) with peaks of sensitivity in DKL-space. Results partially confirmed this idea: JNDs demarcated perceptual categories at the binary hues around green, blue and less clearly around yellow, when colors were isoluminant with the background and when accounting for the overall variation of sensitivity by fitting an ellipse. The categorical JND pattern for those three categories was in line with the effect of the second-stage mechanisms. In contrast, the results for unique red, binary red-yellow, and the JNDs for dark colors clearly contradicted categorical perception. There was a JND maximum around the center of red and JNDs strongly decreased away from the center. Although this observation alone would also be in line with categorical perception; unique red was shifted away from the center towards yellow so that unique red was close to the minimum instead of the maximum JND, hence contradicting categorical perception. In addition, we also showed that observers do not adjust unique hues more consistently than binary hues, confirming a previous study. Taken together, our findings suggest that some of the unique hues could be inherent in the early stages of color processing. At the same time, they also raise questions about complex effects of lightness, chroma and instructions on the measurements of JNDs and unique hues.},

Calcium is needed for a variety of cellular and metabolic processes in the body. Large amounts of vitamin D can be produced in the skin when exposed to UV-B radiation. It is therefore a paradox that in Europe, Caucasians living in higher latitude countries, such as Scandinavia and Iceland, have higher serum vitamin D compared with those living in lower latitude. In a recent study of adult-type lactase persistence (LP), it was shown that Caucasian of European descent, who carried the C-13910T LP allele, had higher levels of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with those who were lactase non-persistent. This was attributed to higher consumption of dairy. We postulated that the distribution of the LP C-13910T allele in Caucasian populations may explain the vitamin D concentration pattern seen in Europe.Subjects/methodsBaseline mean total serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration from a clinical trial of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis was correlated to published LP frequencies in European populations.ResultsIn multiple regression analysis, mean total serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in both winter and summer were in turn correlated to LP phenotype frequency (winter: r2 = 0.51, p < 0.05; summer: r2 = 0.4, p < 0.05).ConclusionsHigh frequency of LP in northern Europe may explain high mean total serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations despite low UV-B radiation exposure.},

 abstract = {Here we report the results of an experiment that tests the reciprocal risk reduction1 and ‘tolerated theft’ or taking hypotheses2 for why the human species is unique in having extensive exchange of resources among non-kin. We designed an experiment to determine whether, in response to variance of resource acquisition, people exchange food resources via taking or, alternatively, form reciprocal relationships based on giving. In the experiment, subjects forage individually, experience variation in resource acquisition, and then consume either by actions in which resources are taken from, or moved to, others in a group environment. The key feature of the experimental design is that individuals can transfer resources to others, attempt to take resources from others and defend against take-away attempts. Many subjects begin by attempting to take resources from others, who can resist those attempts at a cost to each. Over time, subjects shift to a cooperative strategy of voluntary reciprocal giving, a response not suggested by the instructions. These results provide evidence that people are independently able to overcome initial use of taking strategies, evaluate gains from exchange, and create endogenous reciprocal trading relationships as a response to unsynchronized variance in resource availability.},

However, the focus of this book has revolved around understanding the multispecies interactions that have occurred throughout time. Intriguingly, many of the impacts and alterations from human life and adaptation have gone unseen, and remains largely unexamined to this day. Microorganisms coat every surface of the earth – the ground we walk on, the air we breathe, the bodies we live in, the water we drink, and the animals and artifacts we interact with on a daily basis. Every decision, movement, and interaction that humans have with the earth impacts these microorganisms. Therefore, it has become critical to examine these diverse microbial communities in the world, and examine how human activity altered and impacted these inter-species relationships. While a unique form of multispecies interaction, the relationship humans have with the microorganisms that live within the body – the microbiota – is a critical one for understanding the ramifications of human activity in the past.},

 abstract = {The term Khoisan, alternatively spelled “Khoesan,” is used by contemporary linguists as a convenient blanket term for the non-Bantu and non-Cushitic click-using languages of Africa and does not imply the existence of any familial relationships between the member groups. Some scholars include two isolate click languages of Tanzania, namely, Hadza and Sandawe, within the scope of a so-called “Macro-Khoisan,” although there is little evidence to suggest that these two languages are related even to each other, let alone to any of the southern African languages. This chapter begins by setting out the shifting speaker numbers and distributions of the diverse and often trans-nationally located Khoisan languages of southern Africa, as far as these have been reliably estimated for the present day on the basis of population surveys, and as far as they can be reasonably projected for the relatively recent, largely colonial period on the basis of historical records. The discussion then draws on comparative linguistic evidence (in both a narrow and wider sense) to assess various popular beliefs concerning the older, undocumented past of the Khoisan languages, which are often romantically imagined to be the last vestiges of some primordial African substrate – and the possibility of an alternative scenario is briefly sketched. The chapter concludes with a few brief notes on the uncertain future of these highly endangered African languages in an era of conflicting economic, political, and social-cultural demands.},

                Composed of hundreds of microbial species, the composition of the human gut microbiota can vary with chronic diseases underlying health disparities that disproportionally affect ethnic minorities. However, the influence of ethnicity on the gut microbiota remains largely unexplored and lacks reproducible generalizations across studies. By distilling associations between ethnicity and differences in two United States based 16S gut microbiota datasets including 1,673 individuals, we report 12 microbial genera and families that reproducibly vary by ethnicity. Interestingly, a majority of these microbial taxa, including the most heritable bacterial family, Christensenellaceae, overlap with genetically-associated taxa and form co-occurring clusters linked by similar fermentative and methanogenic metabolic processes. These results demonstrate recurrent associations between specific taxa in the gut microbiota and ethnicity, providing hypotheses for examining specific members of the gut microbiota as mediators of health disparities.},

 abstract = { Surface morphometry comprises a relevant set of techniques that provide objective tools to identify, map, and understand use wear patterns in stone tools. Thus far, these techniques have been applied mainly to 2D or 2.5D data, but their application to 3D 360° data is promising and still underdeveloped. Here, we apply new 3D techniques to calculate morphometric variables and to analyse surficial features and changes in pounding stone tools used for baobab processing among Hadza foragers of Tanzania. Baobab pounding stones were collected after use by Hadza foragers for processing the plant food and then 3D point clouds were acquired from laser scanners and SfM photogrammetry. Morphometry was conducted directly on 3D point clouds to avoid time-consuming and surface modifications related to more complex 3D data, such as meshing. Several morphometric variables were computed for the complete pieces (360° sphere) providing fast and accurate data to identify the detailed morphometric features of the artefacts. Additionally, stone surface changes due to baobab processing were measured by comparing the stone surface before and after use, thus enabling calculation of spatial abrasion patterns. Data were interpreted using multivariate exploratory statistical analysis. Differences in the effect of processing on surface morphology are likely explained by variations in raw source material and use. Results suggest that the traces produced by baobab processing on stone tools should be detectable in the archaeological record.},

 abstract = {Since the inception of modern social evolution theory, a vast majority of studies have sought to explain cooperation using relatedness-driven hypotheses. Natural populations, however, show a substantial amount of variation in social behaviour that is uncorrelated with relatedness. Age offers a major alternative explanation for variation in behaviour that remains unaccounted for. Most natural populations are structured into age-classes, with ageing being a nearly universal feature of most major taxa, including eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Despite this, the theoretical underpinnings of age-dependent social behaviour remain limited. Here, I investigate how group age-composition, demography and life history shape trajectories of age-dependent behaviours that are expressed conditionally on an actor and recipient's age. I show that demography introduces novel age-dependent selective pressures acting on social phenotypes. Furthermore, I find that life history traits influence the costs and benefits of cooperation directly, but also indirectly. Life history has a strong impact not only on the genetic structure of the population but also on the distribution of group age-compositions, with both of these processes influencing the expression of age-dependent cooperation. Age of peak reproductive performance, in particular, is of chief importance for the evolution of cooperation, as this will largely determine the age and relatedness of social partners. Moreover, my results suggest that later-life reproductive senescence may occur because of demographic effects alone, which opens new vistas on the evolution of menopause and related phenomena.},

Here we used an <i>in vitro</i> human digestive and gut microbiota model system to investigate the effect of three commercial fiber products; NutriKane™, Benefiber® and Psyllium husk (Macro) on the adult gut microbiota. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing results showed dramatic fiber-dependent changes in the gut microbiota structure and composition. Specific bacterial OTUs within the families <i>Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> showed an increase in the relative abundances in the presence of one or more fiber product(s), while <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Pseudomonadaceae</i> showed a reduction in the relative abundances upon addition of all fiber treatments compared to the no added fiber control. Fiber-specific increases in SCFA concentrations showed correlation with the relative abundance of potential SCFA-producing gut bacteria. The chemical composition, antioxidant potential and polyphenolic content profiles of each fiber product were determined and found to be highly variable. Observed product-specific variations could be linked to differences in the chemical composition of the fiber products. The general nature of the fiber-dependent impact was relatively consistent across the individuals, which may demonstrate the potential of the products to alter the gut microbiota in a similar, and predictable direction, despite variability in the starting composition of the individual gut microbiota.},

Here, I summarize and critique previously proposed theories to explain human susceptibility to AD, grouped into 8 distinct hypotheses based on the concepts of novel extension of the lifespan; lack of selective pressure during the post-reproductive phase; antagonistic pleiotropy; rapid brain evolution; delayed neuropathy by selection for grandmothering; novel alleles selected to delay neuropathy; by-product of selection against cardiovascular disease; and thrifty genotype. Subsequently, I describe a new hypothesis inspired by the concept of mismatched environments. Many of the factors that enhance AD risk today may have been absent or functioned differently before the modern era, potentially making AD a less common affliction for age-matched individuals before industrialization and for the majority of human history. Future research is needed to further explore whether changes in environments and lifestyles across human history moderate risk factors and susceptibility to AD.},

To the best of our knowledge, the fundamental question of how the abundance and function of the gut microbiota of domestic dogs evolved to adapt to the changes in host feeding habits has yet to be addressed. In this study, our comparative analyses of gut metagenomes showed that the abundance of gut microbiota between the two species have some significant differences. Furthermore, a number of taxa observed in higher numbers in domestic dogs are related to carbohydrate metabolism, which may be because that there were more complicated polysaccharides in dogs diets than that in wolves diets. A significant difference in the abundance of genes encoding glycosyltransferase family 34 (GT34), carbohydrate-binding module family 25 (CBM25), and glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) between the gut microbiota metagenomes of domestic dogs and gray wolves also supported this observation. Furthermore, the domestic dog gut microbiota has greater valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. This result showed that compared with wolves, the domestic dog diet contains a smaller amount of animal protein, which is consistent with the dietary composition of wolves and dogs. Our results indicate that the function and abundance of gut microbiota of domestic dogs has been adapted to domestication, which is of great significance for the ability of domestic dogs to adapt to changes in food composition.},

                  CrAssphage (cross-assembly phage) is a bacteriophage that was first discovered in human gut metagenomic data. CrAssphage belongs to a diverse family of crAss-like bacteriophages thought to infect gut commensal bacteria belonging to
                  Bacteroides
                  species. However, not much is known about the biogeography of crAssphage and whether certain strains are associated with specific human populations. In this study, we screened publicly available human gut metagenomic data from 3,341 samples for the presence of crAssphage
                  sensu stricto
                  (NC_024711.1). We found that crAssphage prevalence is low in traditional, hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru, as compared to industrialized, urban populations. Statistical comparisons showed no association of crAssphage prevalence with variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and health status of individuals. Phylogenetic analyses show that crAssphage strains reconstructed from the same individual over multiple time-points, cluster together. CrAssphage strains from individuals from the same study population do not always cluster together. Some evidence of clustering is seen at the level of broadly defined geographic regions, however, the relative positions of these clusters within the crAssphage phylogeny are not well-supported. We hypothesize that this lack of strong biogeographic structuring is suggestive of a recent expansion event within crAssphage. Using a Bayesian dating approach, we estimate this expansion has occurred within the past 200 years. Overall, we determine that crAssphage presence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle. The absence of strong biogeographic structuring within global crAssphage strains is likely due to a recent population expansion within this bacteriophage.

 abstract = {Abstract Reconstructing individual dietary histories at Shamanka II, an Early Neolithic (7000–5700 cal. BP) Kitoi hunter‐gatherer cemetery in Cis‐Baikal, Siberia, revealed surprising intrapopulation variability in childhood diets. Stable isotope analytical data produced by micro‐sampled first molars identified changes in both the timing and rate of weaning for different individuals. Further, examination within the framework of a high‐resolution radiocarbon chronology identified shifting practices between two phases of cemetery use, and additional links with mortuary treatment that indicates differences relating to group and/or family structure. The differential treatment of infants, correlated with the complex hunter‐gatherer social structure, and subsequent burial treatment evident at this cemetery are investigated in light of regional dietary trends.},

 abstract = {The coastal environments of South Africa’s Cape Floristic Region (CFR) provide some of the earliest and most abundant evidence for the emergence of cognitively modern humans. In particular, the south coast of the CFR provided for hunter-gatherers a uniquely diverse resource base, namely marine shellfish, game, and carbohydrate-bearing plants, especially those with underground storage organs (USOs). It has been hypothesized that these resource underpinned the continuity of human occupation in the region since the Middle Pleistocene. Very little research has been conducted on the foraging potential of carbohydrate resources in the CFR. This study focuses on the seasonal availability of plants with edible carbohydrate by assessing their visibility to foragers at six-weekly intervals over a two-year period in four vegetation types on South Africa’s Cape south coast. A total of 52 edible plant species were recorded across all vegetation types. Of these, 33 species were geophytes with edible USOs and 21 species had aboveground edible carbohydrates. Limestone Fynbos had the richest flora, followed by Strandveld, Renosterveld and lastly, Sand Fynbos. The availability of USO species differed across vegetation types and between survey years. The number of available USO species was highest for a six-month period from winter to early summer (Jul-Dec) across all vegetation types. Months of lowest species’ availability were in mid-summer to early autumn (Jan-Apr); the early winter (May-Jun) values were variable, being highest in Limestone Fynbos. However, even during the late summer carbohydrate “crunch”, 25 carbohydrate bearing species were visible across the four vegetation types. Overall, the plant-based carbohydrate resources available to Stone Age foragers of the Cape south coast, especially USOs belonging to the Iridaceae family, are likely to have comprised a reliable and nutritious source of calories over most of the year. The winter and early spring months likely coincided with a scarcity of protein, especially marine invertebrates, but an abundance of carbohydrates. At these times, plant carbohydrates, especially USOs, may have comprised 100% of dietary intake. However, recognising which vegetation types are most productive, identifying hotspots of productivity and distinguishing between edible and toxic USOs must have required considerable cognitive skills.},

Malignant breast tumors have lower Lactobacillus abundance compared with benign lesions, implicating Lactobacillus as a negative regulator of breast cancer. Diet is a main determinant of gut microbial diversity. Whether diet affects breast microbiome populations is unknown. In a non-human primate model, we found that consumption of a Western or Mediterranean diet modulated mammary gland microbiota and metabolite profiles. Mediterranean diet consumption led to increased mammary gland Lactobacillus abundance compared with Western diet-fed monkeys. Moreover, mammary glands from Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys had higher levels of bile acid metabolites and increased bacterial-processed bioactive compounds. These data suggest that diet directly influences microbiome populations outside the intestinal tract in distal sites such as the mammary gland. Our study demonstrates that diet affects the mammary gland microbiome, establishing an alternative mechanistic pathway for breast cancer prevention.},

This article overviews the high-throughput research screening on multifactorial interplay between genetic risk factors, the intestinal microbiota, urbanization, modernization, Westernization, the environmental influences and immune responses in the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Inflammatory bowel disease is an expensive multifactorial debilitating disease that affects thousands new people annually worldwide with no known etiology or cure. The conservative therapeutics focus on the established pathology where the immune dysfunction and gut injury have already happened but do not preclude or delay the progression. Inflammatory bowel disease is evolving globally and has become a global emergence disease. It is largely known to be a disease in industrial-urbanized societies attributed to modernization and Westernized lifestyle associated with environmental factors to genetically susceptible individuals with determined failure to process certain commensal antigens. In the developing nations, increasing incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with rapid urbanization, modernization and Westernization of the population. In summary, there are identified multiple associations to host exposures potentiating the landscape risk hazards of inflammatory bowel disease trigger, that include: Western life-style and diet, host genetics, altered innate and/or acquired/adaptive host immune responses, early-life microbiota exposure, change in microbiome symbiotic relationship (dysbiosis/dysbacteriosis), pollution, changing hygiene status, socioeconomic status and several other environmental factors have long-standing effects/influence tolerance. The ongoing multipronged robotic studies on gut microbiota composition disparate patterns between the rural vs. urban locations may help elucidate and better understand the contribution of microbiome disciplines/ecology and evolutionary biology in potentially protecting against the development of inflammatory bowel disease.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                Although the microbiota in the proximal gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been implicated in health and disease, much of these microbes remains understudied compared to the distal GI tract. This study characterized the microbiota across multiple proximal GI sites over time in healthy individuals.
                As part of a study of the pharmacokinetics of oral mesalamine administration, healthy, fasted volunteers (N=8; 10 observation periods total) were orally intubated with a four-lumen catheter with multiple aspiration ports. Samples were taken from stomach, duodenal, and multiple jejunal sites, sampling hourly (≤7 hours) to measure mesalamine (administered at t=0), pH, and 16S rRNA gene-based composition.
                
                  We observed a predominance of Firmicutes across proximal GI sites, with significant variation compared to stool. The microbiota was more similar within individuals over time than between subjects, with the fecal microbiota being unique from that of the small intestine. The stomach and duodenal microbiota displayed highest intra-individual variability compared to jejunal sites, which were more stable across time. We observed significant correlations in the duodenal microbial composition with changes in pH; linear mixed models identified positive correlations with multiple
                  Streptococcus
                  operational taxonomic units (OTU) and negative correlations with multiple
                  Prevotella and Pasteurellaceae
                  OTUs. Few OTUs correlated with mesalamine concentration.
                
                The stomach and duodenal microbiota exhibited greater compositional dynamics compared to the jejunum. Short-term fluctuations in the duodenal microbiota was correlated with pH. Given the unique characteristics and dynamics of the proximal GI tract microbiota, it is important to consider these local environments in health and disease states.},

 abstract = {Humans with metabolic and inflammatory diseases frequently harbour lower levels of butyrate-producing bacteria in their gut. However, it is not known whether variation in the levels of these organisms is causally linked with disease development and whether diet modifies the impact of these bacteria on health. Here we show that a prominent gut-associated butyrate-producing bacterial genus (Roseburia) is inversely correlated with atherosclerotic lesion development in a genetically diverse mouse population. We use germ-free apolipoprotein E-deficient mice colonized with synthetic microbial communities that differ in their capacity to generate butyrate to demonstrate that Roseburia intestinalis interacts with dietary plant polysaccharides to: impact gene expression in the intestine, directing metabolism away from glycolysis and toward fatty acid utilization; lower systemic inflammation; and ameliorate atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intestinal administration of butyrate reduces endotoxaemia and atherosclerosis development. Together, our results illustrate how modifiable diet-by-microbiota interactions impact cardiovascular disease, and suggest that interventions aimed at increasing the representation of butyrate-producing bacteria may provide protection against atherosclerosis.},

Seasonal fluctuations in fasting glucose levels and GCT results were previously described. We sought to investigate seasonal changes in GCT results in a large cohort.
METHODS: GCT results were analyzed of all women insured at the Central District of Clalit Health Services (the largest health maintenance organization in Israel), between the years 2005 and 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 101,359 GCT results were analyzed. Mean GCT was 110 ± 28.9 mg/dL, and 14.5% (n = 14,652) were pathological. Both the mean and the incidence of pathological GCT were lowest in the winter, followed by spring, fall, and summer, (p for trend < 0.001). The difference in mean GCT between winter and summer was 7.82 ± 0.24 mg/dL (95% CI, 7.35-8.29). After adjustment for BMI and age, having a GCT in the winter was independently associated with the lowest risk for pathological GCT, as compared to all other seasons.
CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal changes in GCT results should be studied further in additional regions, and if found, the cutoff threshold for abnormal GCT should be re-examined and adapted to local weather conditions and seasonal variability.},

Since the 1980s, the primary pharmacological treatment has been antidepressants, but due to the recent discovery of the association between the gut microbiome and mental health, probiotics have been proposed as an adjunctive or alternate treatment. In this narrative review, we aim to provide a holistic perspective by synthesizing and evaluating existing evidence, discussing key biological mechanisms, exploring the history of probiotic use, and appreciating the influence of modern diet on mental health. Five online databases were searched for relevant studies up to December 2017. Systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depressive symptoms were included. Seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Three of these reviews conducted meta-analyses, out of which, two concluded that probiotics improved depressive symptoms in the sample population. Out of the four reviews that conducted qualitative analysis, three reviews concluded that probiotics have the potential to be used as a treatment. Due to the differences in clinical trials, a definitive effect of probiotics on depressive symptoms cannot be concluded. Nonetheless, probiotics seem to potentially produce a significant therapeutic effect for subjects with pre-existing depressive symptoms. Further studies are warranted for definitive conclusions.},

However, the influence of ethnicity on the gut microbiota remains largely unexplored and lacks reproducible generalizations across studies. By distilling associations between ethnicity and differences in two US-based 16S gut microbiota data sets including 1,673 individuals, we report 12 microbial genera and families that reproducibly vary by ethnicity. Interestingly, a majority of these microbial taxa, including the most heritable bacterial family, Christensenellaceae, overlap with genetically associated taxa and form co-occurring clusters linked by similar fermentative and methanogenic metabolic processes. These results demonstrate recurrent associations between specific taxa in the gut microbiota and ethnicity, providing hypotheses for examining specific members of the gut microbiota as mediators of health disparities.},

 abstract = {The relative importance of individual and social learning in acquiring complex technological skills in animals is debated, especially the influence of processes allowing high copying fidelity (namely, imitation and teaching). We investigated how immature wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, acquired the technique for extracting underground honey. This technique is interesting because (1) adults perform exploration, pounding and perforation in nonrandom but highly flexible action sequences to locate underground bee nests, (2) they have individual preferences for how to perforate the ground and (3) the nests are deeply buried and concealed, making success difficult to achieve. We analysed the behaviour of 16 immatures recorded by camera traps at 50 sites, and tested the influence of individual attributes (namely, age and sex) and maternal behaviour; we also tested whether mothers provided learning opportunities for their offspring. We found that, as they aged, immatures of both sexes progressively matched adults' behaviour in action sequences and observed their social models more continuously. Immature males used the most common grip type used by adults for perforating (namely, the coordinated use of hands and feet) progressively more as they aged, but no effect of maternal preferences was detected. Thus, the adult technique was probably acquired via a combination of physical maturation (i.e. increased body strength and motor coordination) and observational learning, although individual learning could not be completely ruled out. Finally, the proportion of time mothers spent inactive at bee nest sites was high when they were accompanied by young daughters and decreased as daughters aged, while the opposite pattern was found for sons. Mothers may thus stimulate learning by immatures by adjusting their behaviour according to their offspring's sex and age. Overall, we showed that immature chimpanzees acquired this complex tool use behaviour via a combination of social and nonsocial learning processes, including potential maternal stimulation.},

Antimicrobials alter the structure of the microbiota, expand the host-specific pool of antimicrobial-resistance genes and organisms, degrade the protective effects of the microbiota against invasion by pathogens, and may impair vaccine efficacy. Through these effects on the microbiome they may affect immune responses. Vaccines that exert protective or therapeutic effects against pathogens may reduce the use of antimicrobials, the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and the harmful impacts of these drugs on the microbiome. Other strategies involving manipulation of the microbiome to deplete antibiotic-resistant organisms or to enhance immune responses to vaccines may prove valuable in addressing antimicrobial resistance as well. This article describes the intersections of immunity, microbiome and antimicrobial exposure, and the use of vaccines and other alternative strategies for the control and management of antimicrobial resistance.},

Fecal microbiota and blood cytokines were analyzed before and after Ge-OH treatment, as well as IBS symptomatology by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-IBS).ResultsThe results show that orally administered Ge-OH is a powerful modulator of the intestinal microbial ecosystem, capable of leading to increased relative abundances of Collinsella and especially Faecalibacterium, a well-known health-promoting butyrate producer consistently found to be decreased in IBS patients. Moreover, Ge-OH strongly improved the clinical symptoms of colitis by significantly reducing the score recorded by the VAS-IBS questionnaire. Clinical improvement was associated with a significant reduction in the circulating MIP-1β, a chemokine found to be increased in several IBS patients.ConclusionGe-OH could be a powerful component for food supplement targeted to the treatment of IBS patients.Trial registrationISRCTN47041881, retrospectively registered on 19th July 2018.},

 abstract = {Microbial diversity plays a key role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and in the development of the immune system in the gut mucosa. Maybe one of the most important function of our gut microbiota is the immune system education, in particular the discrimination of friends from foes that occurs during childhood. In addition to bacterial antigens, several metabolites of microbial origin have a crucial role in training of the immune system, such as Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). There are many evidences on the role of the gut microbiota in rheumatic diseases, in particular modifications of microbiota composition causing dysbiosis that, in turn, can induce gut permeability, and thus immunological imbalance and trigger inflammation. In particular, immune cells can reach extra-intestinal sites, such as joints and trigger local inflammation. Childhood is a crucial period of life for development and evolution of the gut microbiota, especially for the acquisition of fundamental functions such as immunotolerance of commensal microorganisms. For this reason, gut dysbiosis is gaining interest as a potential pathogenetic factor for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Here we summarized the studies conducted on JIA patients in which a pro-arthritogenic microbial profiles has been observed; this, together with a depletion of microbial biodiversity, clearly distinguish patients' from healthy subjects' microbiota. Further studies are however needed to better clarify the role of microbiota in JIA pathogenesis.},

We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

 abstract = {BackgroundBile salt hydrolase plays an important role in bile acid-mediated signaling pathways, which regulate lipid absorption, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Several reports suggest that changes in the composition of bile acids are found in many diseases caused by dysbacteriosis.ResultsHere, we present the taxonomic identification of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in human microbiota and elucidate the abundance and activity differences of various bacterial BSH among 11 different populations from six continents. For the first time, we revealed that bile salt hydrolase protein sequences (BSHs) are distributed in 591 intestinal bacterial strains within 117 genera in human microbiota, and 27.52% of these bacterial strains containing BSH paralogs. Significant variations are observed in BSH distribution patterns among different populations. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we reclassified these BSHs into eight phylotypes and investigated the abundance patterns of these phylotypes among different populations. From the inspection of enzyme activity among different BSH phylotypes, BSH-T3 showed the highest enzyme activity and is only found in Lactobaclillus. The phylotypes of BSH-T5 and BSH-T6 mainly from Bacteroides with high percentage of paralogs exhibit different enzyme activity and deconjugation activity. Furthermore, we found that there were significant differences between healthy individuals and patients with atherosclerosis and diabetes in some phylotypes of BSHs though the correlations were pleiotropic.ConclusionThis study revealed the taxonomic and abundance profiling of BSH in human gut microbiome and provided a phylogenetic-based system to assess BSHs activity by classifying the target sequence into specific phylotype. Furthermore, the present work disclosed the variation patterns of BSHs among different populations of geographical regions and health/disease cohorts, which is essential to understand the role of BSH in the development and progression of related diseases.},

Prior studies examining the prevalence of this organism have focused on subjects in developed countries and on adults. Now using O. formigenes-specific PCR, we have compared the prevalence of these organisms among subjects in two remote areas in which modern medical practices have hardly been present with a USA group of mothers and their infants for the first three years of life. Among the Amerindians of the Yanomami-Sanema and Yekwana ethnic groups in Venezuela and the Hadza in Tanzania, O. formigenes was detected in 60–80% of the adult subjects, higher than found in adults from USA in this and prior studies. In young children, the prevalence was much lower in USA than in either tribal village. These data extend our understanding of the epidemiology of O. formigenes carriage, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the rising incidence of kidney stones is associated with the progressive loss of O. formigenes colonization in populations that have been highly impacted by modern medical practices.},

However, internal developments and external influences create considerable diversity in consonantal and vocalic patterns. Depressor consonants, ATR/RTR vowels, prenasalised stops, ejectives and clicks are among the sounds that have been investigated using a wide range of articulatory and acoustic instrumental phonetic techniques. Phonetic timing patterns and tone and stress interactions in Bantu languages provide a wealth of patterns to test phonological theories. The Bantu languages have received very extensive historical analysis, Bantu group of languages also provides a fertile field for examining inferences about the nature of phonetic sound change. Vowel height, backness and rounding can all be factors in control of Bantu harmony. The patterning of tones in many Bantu languages resembles that of pitch-accent systems. Bantu languages provide an opportunity to compare phonetic differences between fairly large numbers of related languages. This chapter presents three of the particular issues of phonetic interest are discussed: the dental/alveolar place contrast, the possible occurrence of articulatorily complex consonants, and the nature of the so-called ‘whistling fricatives.’ It aims to aspect of laryngeal action in consonants, to the description of clicks and their distribution in Bantu, and to some of the interesting aspects of nasality which occur in the languages. Aspiration is a contrastive property of voiceless stops in some languages where it is often a reflex of an earlier voiceless prenasalised stop.},

We must endeavor to replace our capitalist growth economy with a system based on human flourishing.

                  In the past two decades, epistemologists have significantly expanded the focus of their field. To the traditional question that has dominated the debate — under what conditions does belief amount to knowledge? — they have added questions about testimony, epistemic virtues and vices, epistemic trust, and more. This broadening of the range of epistemic concern has coincided with an expansion in conceptions of epistemic agency beyond the individualism characteristic of most earlier epistemology. We believe that these developments have not gone far enough. While the weak anti-individualism we see in contemporary epistemology may be adequate for the kinds of cases it tends to focus on, a great deal of human knowledge production and transmission does not conform to these models. Furthermore, the dispositions and norms that are knowledge-conducive in the familiar cases may not be knowledge-conducive generally. In fact, dispositions that, at an individual level, count as epistemic vices may be epistemic virtues in common social contexts. We argue that this overlooked feature of human social life means that epistemology must become more deeply and pervasively social.},

 abstract = {Molecular and isotopic analysis of sediments from archaeological combustion features is a relatively new area of study. Applications can inform us about ancient pyro-technologies and patterns of animal exploitation in a wide range of human contexts, but may be particularly informative with regard to ancient hunter-gatherers. Our analyses of sediments from experimental bone and wood fires, and from controlled laboratory heating sequences, provide fine-grained data on the formation and location of biomarkers from pyrolyzed animal fats in hearths. Integrating microstratigraphic, molecular, and isotopic data can improve recognition of bone fires in archaeological contexts, perhaps even where bone preservation is poor. Experimental bone fires produced an upper layer of calcined bone above a thin layer of tarry black amorphous material coating mineral sediments. Mineral sediments beneath the black layer showed little alteration but high lipid content. Sampling for molecular and isotopic analysis should target the black layer as the bulk of pyrolyzed biomarkers are located here and stable isotope values are less affected than in the overlying layer of ash or calcined bone. The combined presence of certain symmetric and slightly asymmetric saturated long-chain ketones (14-nonacosanone, 16-hentriacontanone 16-tritriacontanone, and 18-pentatriacontanone), especially together with heptadecane (C17n-alkane), are molecular indicators of the thermal degradation of terrestrial animal fat. Formation and relative dominance of these molecules in hearth sediments relates to the initial prevalence of specific precursor fatty acids and can provide broad separations between sources. We suggest that separations could be further supported and expanded by combining stable isotope analysis of the same compounds.},

 abstract = {Although the microbiota in the proximal gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been implicated in health and disease, much about these microbes remains understudied compared to those in the distal GI tract. This study characterized the microbiota across multiple proximal GI sites over time in healthy individuals. As part of a study of the pharmacokinetics of oral mesalamine administration, healthy, fasted volunteers (<i>n</i> = 8; 10 observation periods total) were orally intubated with a four-lumen catheter with multiple aspiration ports. Samples were taken from stomach, duodenal, and multiple jejunal sites, sampling hourly (≤7 h) to measure mesalamine (administered at <i>t</i> = 0), pH, and 16S rRNA gene-based composition. We observed a predominance of <i>Firmicutes</i> across proximal GI sites, with significant variation compared to stool. The microbiota was more similar within individuals over time than between subjects, with the fecal microbiota being unique from that of the small intestine. The stomach and duodenal microbiota displayed highest intraindividual variability compared to jejunal sites, which were more stable across time. We observed significant correlations in the duodenal microbial composition with changes in pH; linear mixed models identified positive correlations with multiple <i>Streptococcus</i> operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and negative correlations with multiple <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Pasteurellaceae</i> OTUs. Few OTUs correlated with mesalamine concentration. The stomach and duodenal microbiota exhibited greater compositional dynamics than the jejunum. Short-term fluctuations in the duodenal microbiota were correlated with pH. Given the unique characteristics and dynamics of the proximal GI tract microbiota, it is important to consider these local environments in health and disease states.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The gut microbiota are linked to a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Despite this importance, microbiota dynamics in the upper gastrointestinal tract are understudied. Our article seeks to understand what factors impact microbiota dynamics in the healthy human upper gut. We found that the upper gastrointestinal tract contains consistently prevalent bacterial OTUs that dominate the overall community. Microbiota variability is highest in the stomach and duodenum and correlates with pH.},

Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.},

 abstract = {Malnutrition has been a serious issue in Ghana and Africa as a whole. However, the potential of many indigenous fruits to combat it has not yet been tested. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the nutritional characteristics of four underutilized wild fruits (<i>Gardenia</i> <i>erubescens</i>, <i>Sclerocarya birrea, Diospyros mespiliformis</i>, and <i>Balanites aegyptiaca</i>) of dietary interest in Ghana. The nutritional and antinutritional characteristics of the fruits were analyzed according to standard methods (laid down by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists and other well-known researchers) on a dry weight (dw) basis. The nutritional value of the fruits was high enough to contribute to the nutrient requirements of humans, with their iron (0.34⁻1.46 mg/100 g), zinc (0.81⁻2.97 mg/100 g), vitamin A (0.84⁻2.03 mg/100 g), and β-carotene (64.84⁻176.89 mg/100 g) contents worth special mention. The antinutrient content also ranged between 0.06⁻1.82 mg/g. Therefore, it is evident from the study that the fruits, although containing some levels of antinutrients, are nutrient-dense, suggesting their potency in fighting malnutrition in humans.},

 abstract = {<i>HLA class I</i> and <i>KIR</i> sequences were determined for Dogon, Fulani, and Baka populations of western Africa, Mbuti of central Africa, and Datooga, Iraqw, and Hadza of eastern Africa. Study of 162 individuals identified 134 <i>HLA class I</i> alleles (41 <i>HLA-A</i>, 60 <i>HLA-B</i>, and 33 <i>HLA-C</i>). Common to all populations are three <i>HLA-C</i> alleles (<i>C1<sup>+</sup>C*07:01</i>, <i>C1<sup>+</sup>C*07:02</i>, and <i>C2<sup>+</sup>C*06:02</i>) but no <i>HLA-A</i> or <i>-B</i> Unexpectedly, no novel <i>HLA class I</i> was identified in these previously unstudied and anthropologically distinctive populations. In contrast, of 227 <i>KIR</i> detected, 22 are present in all seven populations and 28 are novel. A high diversity of <i>HLA A-C-B</i> haplotypes was observed. In six populations, most haplotypes are represented just once. But in the Hadza, a majority of haplotypes occur more than once, with 2 having high frequencies and 10 having intermediate frequencies. The centromeric (<i>cen</i>) part of the <i>KIR</i> locus exhibits an even balance between <i>cenA</i> and <i>cenB</i> in all seven populations. The telomeric (<i>tel</i>) part has an even balance of <i>telA</i> to <i>telB</i> in East Africa, but this changes across the continent to where <i>telB</i> is vestigial in West Africa. All four KIR ligands (A3/11, Bw4, C1, and C2) are present in six of the populations. <i>HLA</i> haplotypes of the Iraqw and Hadza encode two KIR ligands, whereas the other populations have an even balance between haplotypes encoding one and two KIR ligands. Individuals in these African populations have a mean of 6.8-8.4 different interactions between KIR and HLA class I, compared with 2.9-6.5 for non-Africans.},

 abstract = {The debate on whether or not a wali is required in a marriage contract has been a long standing issue among Muslim jurists, particularly during the formation of madzahib (schools of thought). The mainstream view held by Indonesian Muslims who are mostly adhered to the Syafi'i madzhab is that the presence of a wali becomes a criteria for the validity of a marriage. However, if the issue of wali is being re-examined by using historical and Islamic jurisprudence approach it is found that the presence of wali is not required in all marriage contracts of all women. A woman may become a wali and may marry off herself without a wali if she fulfils the requirement of being a wali, namely intelligent, sound of judgment, mature and independent. Such a view is held by scholars from the Hanafi school of law. Nevertheless, the concept of wali is not merely a legal issue; it is a meant for guaranteeing the wellbeing of a woman upon entering her marriage. The Prophet is therefore suggested that wali should be presented in a marriage contract.},

Recently, an exciting body of work has examined linguistic phenomena through the lens of efficiency in usage: what otherwise puzzling features of language find explanation in formal accounts of how language might be optimized for communication and learning? Here, we review studies that deploy formal tools from probability and information theory to understand how and why language works the way that it does, focusing on phenomena ranging from the lexicon through syntax. These studies show how a pervasive pressure for efficiency guides the forms of natural language and indicate that a rich future for language research lies in connecting linguistics to cognitive psychology and mathematical theories of communication and inference.},

 abstract = {Over the past decade, countries have strived to develop a global governance structure to halt deforestation and forest degradation, by achieving the readiness requirements for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). Nonetheless, deforestation continues, and seemingly intact forest areas are being degraded. Furthermore, REDD+ may fail to consider the crucial ecosystem functions of forest fauna including seed dispersal and pollination. Throughout the tropics, forest animal populations are depleted by unsustainable hunting to the extent that many forests are increasingly devoid of larger mammals—a condition referred to as empty forests. Large mammals and birds, who often disperse seeds of larger more carbon-rich tree species, are preferentially targeted by hunters and the first to be depleted. Such defaunation has cascading ecosystem effects, changing forest structure and composition with implications for carbon storage capacity. Failure to address defaunation would therefore be a major oversight in REDD+, compromising its long-term viability. We carried out a desktop study reviewing REDD+ documents and national implementation efforts in Colombia, Ecuador, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Indonesia to assess the extent to which they address hunting and acknowledged the ecosystem functions of fauna. We also assessed sub-national REDD+ projects to determine whether they recognized hunting and if and how they incorporated hunting management and wildlife monitoring at the project level. Moreover, we assessed to what extent sub-national REDD+ projects addressed the long-term impacts of the sustainability of hunting on forest ecosystem function including carbon storage. We found that hunting, the risk of defaunation, and its effects have been ignored in the REDD+ policy process at both the international and national levels. At the project level, we found some reference to hunting and the risks posed by the loss of forest fauna, albeit only addressed superficially. Our results underline the fact that forest ecosystems are being reduced to their carbon content and that, despite the rhetoric of biodiversity co-benefits, fauna is not treated as a functional component of forests. This neglect threatens to undermine forest ecosystem function and service delivery as well as long-term forest carbon assimilation capacity and hence, ultimately, to compromise REDD+ objectives.},

 abstract = {Abstract Domestication may have had convergent effects on the microbiota of domesticates and humans through analogous ecological shifts. Comparing the gut microbiota of domestic and related wild mammals plus humans and chimpanzees, we found consistent shifts in composition in domestic animals and in humans from industrialized but not traditional societies. Reciprocal diet switches in mice and canids demonstrated that diet played a dominant role in shaping the domestic gut microbiota, with stronger responses in the member of the wild-domestic pair with higher dietary and microbial diversity. Laboratory mice recovered wild-like microbial diversity and responsiveness with experimental colonization. We conclude that domestication and industrialization have similarly impacted the gut microbiota, emphasizing the utility of domestic animal models and diets for understanding host-microbial interactions in rapidly changing environments.},

 abstract = {Humans that inhabited the glacial refugia in the Cape Floristic Region are assumed to have harvested and consumed plant underground storage organs (USOs) as an important carbohydrate source during the Middle Pleistocene. Botha et al. (2020, this issue), and others have demonstrated the rich resource that such plants might offer to early human gatherers. However, such studies do not correct for the likely reduction in plant productivity and USO yields related to much reduced CO2 concentrations typical of Pleistocene glacial periods. To assess the need for such a correction, we grew Oxalis pes-caprae, a species harvested by the human gatherers, at a range of CO2 concentrations from glacial to current. Decreasing CO2 concentrations to glacial levels almost halved the mass of bulbs produced, while biomass was preferentially allocated to roots and shoots, which were not significantly decreased relative to plants grown at current CO2 concentrations. This would have major implications for estimating the potential calorific return to foraging effort, as modelled using anthropological data and assuming that USO yields would be similarly affected. The model suggests that an almost doubled foraging effort would have been required at glacial compared to current conditions. This highlights the need to consider plant growth conditions and particularly atmospheric CO2 concentrations when extrapolating current anthropological studies to the past, which could be a major gap in understanding human dietary preferences in glacial conditions.},

In addition, little is known about how trans-kingdom interactions might influence disease susceptibility and progression.

 abstract = {Plants have developed toxic chemical and physical defenses as a consequence of their co-evolution with herbivores. Humans, like other animal species, have evolved strategies to protect themselves from such plant dangers. For example, recent studies have shown that human infants exhibit a reluctance to manually explore plants and use social learning (SL) to acquire knowledge about plants. However, SL can also be costly under certain circumstances and there is reason to suspect this may be the case for plants. Some plant species are difficult to distinguish from one another. For example, some plants have evolved an adaptive strategy to fight against herbivorous threats, called Batesian mimicry, in which an edible plant mimics features of a poisonous plant to minimize the probability that it is consumed. When SL is prevalent in a population, by proliferating the knowledge about an edible mimic, SL also spreads the risk of consuming its poisonous counterpart. Here we propose a model describing different scenarios where SL is (a) favored, (b) ecologically stable, and (c) expected to evolve. Results show that SL is selected when the proportion of poisonous plants is high. However, this is only true if the edible mimic population is below a certain threshold and its selection depends on the capacity to minimize errors when differentiating edible mimics from their poisonous counterparts.},

We now have a solid foundation for studying the microbiota and thus recent efforts have focused on identifying how perturbations to the microbiota composition and function affect disease risk. This chapter focuses on the relationship between the microbiota and cardiometabolic risk with an emphasis on how diet modulates these effects. The gut microbiome of healthy adults is remarkably stable in the absence of large perturbations—such as dramatic weight loss or gain, dietary changes, or antibiotic use. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome have been identified to increase susceptibility to several chronic metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. One challenge in understanding the role of the microbiome in health is the difficulty establishing causality between actual microbes within the microbiota and disease. In addition to the use of model organisms, there is evidence that perturbing, and even transplanting, the microbiome between humans may have therapeutic benefit. Much of the efforts to understand the interactions of diet and the microbiome have focused on the effects of a high-fat, calorie-rich diet. Extensive epidemiological evidence has led to the broad recommendation to consume a diet high in fiber to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.},

 abstract = {Environmental changes can induce diversity shifts within ecosystems that affect interactions between species. Similarly, the development of kidney disease induces shifts within the ecosystem of the intestinal microbiome, affecting host physiology and fitness. Renal failure itself, together with related changes in diet and medication, alters the microbiota and its secretome of micronutrients, nutrients and regulatory metabolites towards a phenotype characterized by the production of uraemic toxins, hence contributing to the clinical syndrome of uraemia and its complications. These alterations are associated with structural changes in the intestinal wall that impair barrier function and cause leakage of bacterial metabolites, bacterial wall products and live bacteria into the circulation. Thus, the intestinal microbiota represents a new therapeutic target to improve outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including symptoms of uraemia, metabolic changes, cardiovascular complications, aberrant immunity and disease progression. Initial interventional studies have shown promising effects of unselective probiotic preparations on kidney inflammation and uraemia in patients with CKD but longer-term studies are needed. Here, we take an ecological approach to understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in determining survival fitness in kidney disease.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although pre-Hispanic hunter-gatherer and horticulturalist (known as Guaraní) societies from the lower Paraná River Delta (Argentina) presented differences in diet, pottery decoration, mortuary practices, and places of origin, differences in skeletal morphology between such groups have never been systematically explored. This work focuses on variations in humeral and femoral external linear measurements and derived structural properties of adult individuals from both societies as well as on variations in body mass and stature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone length, epiphyseal size, and midshaft breadth were measured in 82 adult humeri and 100 femora from hunter-gatherer and Guaraní archeological sites. Epiphyseal and midshaft robusticity, residual strength, midshaft shape and area, stature, and body mass were then estimated. Mann-Whitney tests were run to compare the hunter-gatherer and Guaraní samples.
RESULTS: Male Guaraní individuals presented stronger humeri and more robust femoral and humeral proximal epiphyses than hunter-gatherers. In addition, female Guaraní individuals showed rounder femoral diaphyses in comparison with female hunter-gatherers. Concerning stature, the Guaraní individuals were found to be shorter than hunter-gatherers, regardless of sex. No statistical differences were found in body mass.
DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that skeletal variations between Guaraní and hunter-gatherers could be a consequence of differences in mechanical loadings and genetic composition, bone robusticity is also positively correlated with increased age, but as the age composition of the Guaraní sample could not be estimated, skeletal variation between the samples could be a consequence of differences in age distribution.},

The cache consisted of 21 obsidian prismatic blades and a number of chert artifacts, including 21 stemmed bifaces, a large laurel leaf biface, and a tridentate eccentric. The technological analysis of the stemmed bifaces identified three distinct stem production techniques that may be attributable to a combination of idiosyncratic knapping gestures and laterality, or handedness. A survey of Maya iconography demonstrated that large laurel-leaf bifaces and tridentate eccentrics occur in scenes depicting sacrifice and the burning of human remains, often by ritual specialists titled ch’ajoom, or “person of incense.” It is suggested that the presence of a large laurel-leaf biface and tridentate eccentric in the cache may indicate that Blue Creek was the residence of ch’ajoom at some point during the Late Classic period.},

Significant results were obtained between 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms and IBS risk among studies with the genotype distribution of controls in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (L vs. S, OR =  1.41, 95% CI: 1.11–1.79; LL vs. SS, OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.16–4.08; LL vs. LS + SS, OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25–4.20). In subgroup analyses, 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms were significantly associated with increased IBS-C risk in China; however, no risk was observed for IBS-D and IBS-M.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    This meta-analysis clearly indicates that 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of IBS in the Chinese population, especially IBS-C.

 abstract = {Public health authorities in low- and middle-income countries face dramatic challenges in handling rapidly increasing non-communicable diseases (NCDs), due to the epidemiological- and particularly nutritional transition. Among major reasons for the development of NCDs are smoking and alcohol, but overnutrition and obesity are also major threats to population health. Obesity is related to diabetes and cancer, but also has a genetic background. It is difficult to recommend a healthy nutrition. This is because of conflicting nutritional conceptions, and given the complexity of human metabolism understanding this topic can be difficult for the laymen.  Public health measures advocating physical activity and refraining from high intake of energy, sugar and soft drinks need to be enhanced by supporting the 'intrinsic motivation' to preserve a good health. The mission of public health should be to increase awareness about the complexity of human metabolism, and the involvement of genetic and epigenetics in health and diseases. To maintain homeostasis, means to keep an optimal relationship between catabolism and synthesis, seems to be of particular interest. Preconditions for this is, that public health institutions within the administration- and academic sector follow up developments in life science and molecular biology and conduct population-based research making use of molecular epidemiology, especially those related to key metabolic steps and maintenance of 'homeostasis', in balancing catabolism and anabolism. A prospective biomarker for this situation might be α-2-macroglobulin.},

 abstract = {BackgroundTermites are an important food resource for many human populations around the world, and are a good supply of nutrients. The fungus-farming ‘higher’ termite members of Macrotermitinae are also consumed by modern great apes and are implicated as critical dietary resources for early hominins. While the chemical nutritional composition of edible termites is well known, their microbiomes are unexplored in the context of human health. Here we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of gut microbiota extracted from the whole intestinal tract of two Macrotermes sp. soldiers collected from the Limpopo region of South Africa.ResultsMajor and minor soldier subcastes of M. falciger exhibit consistent differences in taxonomic representation, and are variable in microbial presence and abundance patterns when compared to another edible but less preferred species, M. natalensis. Subcaste differences include alternate patterns in sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Euryarchaeota abundance, and differences in abundance between Alistipes and Ruminococcaceae. M. falciger minor soldiers and M. natalensis soldiers have similar microbial profiles, likely from close proximity to the termite worker castes, particularly during foraging and fungus garden cultivation. Compared with previously published termite and cockroach gut microbiome data, the taxonomic representation was generally split between termites that directly digest lignocellulose and humic substrates and those that consume a more distilled form of nutrition as with the omnivorous cockroaches and fungus-farming termites. Lastly, to determine if edible termites may point to a shared reservoir for rare bacterial taxa found in the gut microbiome of humans, we focused on the genus Treponema. The majority of Treponema sequences from edible termite gut microbiota most closely relate to species recovered from other termites or from environmental samples, except for one novel OTU strain, which clustered separately with Treponema found in hunter-gatherer human groups.ConclusionsMacrotermes consumed by humans display special gut microbial arrangements that are atypical for a lignocellulose digesting invertebrate, but are instead suited to the simplified nutrition in the fungus-farmer diet. Our work brings to light the particular termite microbiome features that should be explored further as avenues in human health, agricultural sustainability, and evolutionary research.},

 abstract = {Extensive post reproductive lifespan (PRLS) is observed only in a few
species, such as humans or resident killer whales, and its origin is under
debate. Hypotheses like mother-care and grandmother-care invoke strategies of
investment--provision to one's descendants to enhance one's overall
reproductive success--to explain PRLS. The contribution of an investment
strategy varies with the age of the caregiver, as the number of care-receiving
descendant changes with age. Here we simulated an agent based model, which is
sensitive to age-specific selection, to examine how the investment strategies
in different hypotheses affect survival and reproduction across different
stages of life. We found that extensive PRLS emerges if we combine multiple
investment strategies, including grandmother-care but not mother-care, which
allow an individual to have an increasing contribution as it ages. We also
found that, if mother-care is further introduced to the PRLS-enabling
strategies, it will let contribution at mid-life to substitute contribution at
late life, which consequently terminates extensive PRLS.},

Grandmother Hypothesis. We build on an earlier model by Kim et al. [27] by
allowing for evolution in both longevity and age at last birth, and also
assuming that post-fertile females support only their daughters' fertility.
Similarly to Kim et al. [27], we find that only two locally stable equilibria
exist: one corresponding to great ape-like longevities and the other
corresponding to hunter-gatherer longevities. Our results show that
grandmothering enables the transition between these two equilibria, without
extending the end of fertility. Moreover, sensitivity analyses of the model
show that male competition, arising from a skew in the mating sex ratio towards
males, plays a significant role in determining whether the transition from
great ape-like longevities to higher longevities is possible and the
equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan. Whereas grandmothering effects
have a significant impact on the equilibrium value of the average age at last
birth and enable the transition to higher longevities, they have an
insignificant impact on the equilibrium value of the average adult lifespan.},

The beneficial potential of probiotic has gradually expanded to areas such as mood improvement, metabolism homeostasis and vaginal health according to scientific research advances. The positive research results provide novel and promising insight into preventing and even therapeutic methods for various human morbidity by probiotic. Scope and approach This review summarized the bidirectional relationship between the host physiology and microbiota from various animal experiments and clinical studies reported in peer-reviewed journal articles. Then the study summarized the benefits that probiotic confer to the host physiology. As a kind of food supplement, application precautions and formula suggestions were also provided for futuristic research and product development. Key Findings and Conclusions: Microbial ecosystem has a symbiotic relationship with host. The alteration in the host physiology and shift in the microbial composition in the hosts can positively or negatively impact each other. The clear and thorough comprehension of the complexity of microbiota–host crosstalk is significant for the development of probiotic intervention. Probiotic may confer various benefits ranging from traditional immune support, gastrointestinal heath even to disease control as sepsis prevention. Probiotic may function in the host mainly through competing with deleterious bacteria, beneficial metabolites and maintaining the homeostasis of gut, and new mechanisms are being discovered each year. The failed clinical study and negative results of probiotic treatment may propose the customized probiotic design for treatment. For probiotic supplement products in the market, upgrading are strongly suggested from aspects of formula innovation and clinically referred probiotic dosage.},

Some, like Japan, that have not used DST over the past decades are thinking about introducing this twice-a-year change in clock time, while others want to abolish the switch between DST and Standard Time, but don't agree which to use: California has proposed keeping <i>perennial</i> DST (i.e., all year round), and the EU debates between <i>perennial</i> Standard Time and <i>perennial</i> DST. Related to the discussion about DST is the discussion to which time zone a country, state or region should belong: the state of Massachusetts in the United States is considering switching to Atlantic Standard Time, i.e., moving the timing of its <i>social clock</i> (local time) 1 h further east (which is equivalent to perennial DST), and Spain is considering leaving the Central European Time to join Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., moving its social timing 1 h further west. A wave of DST discussions seems to periodically sweep across the world. Although DST has always been a political issue, we need to discuss the biology associated with these decisions because the circadian clock plays a crucial role in how the outcome of these discussions potentially impacts our health and performance. Here, we give the necessary background to understand how the <i>circadian clock</i>, <i>the social clock</i>, <i>the sun clock</i>, time zones, and DST interact. We address numerous fallacies that are propagated by lay people, politicians, and scientists, and we make suggestions of how problems associated with DST and time-zones can be solved based on circadian biology.},

 abstract = {The modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), featured by the consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish and lean meat, while excluding grains, dairy products, salt and refined sugar, has gained substantial public attention in recent years because of its potential multiple health benefits. However, to date little is known about the actual impact of this dietary pattern on the gut microbiome (GM) and its implications for human health. In the current scenario where Western diets, low in fiber while rich in industrialized and processed foods, are considered one of the leading causes of maladaptive GM changes along human evolution, likely contributing to the increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases, we hypothesize that the MPD could modulate the Western GM towards a more "ancestral" configuration. In an attempt to shed light on this, here we profiled the GM structure of urban Italian subjects adhering to the MPD, and compared data with other urban Italians following a Mediterranean Diet (MD), as well as worldwide traditional hunter-gatherer populations from previous publications. Notwithstanding a strong geography effect on the GM structure, our results show an unexpectedly high degree of biodiversity in MPD subjects, which well approximates that of traditional populations. The GM of MPD individuals also shows some peculiarities, including a high relative abundance of bile-tolerant and fat-loving microorganisms. The consumption of plant-based foods-albeit with the exclusion of grains and pulses-along with the minimization of the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the MPD, could therefore contribute to partially rewild the GM but caution should be taken in adhering to this dietary pattern in the long term.},

 abstract = {The human microbiome research is with the notable exception of fecal transplantation still mostly in a descriptive phase. Part of the difficulty for translating research into medical interventions is due to the large compositional complexity of the microbiome resulting in datasets that need sophisticated statistical methods for their analysis and do not lend to industrial applications. Another part of the difficulty might be due to logical flaws in terminology particularly concerning 'dysbiosis' that avoids circular conclusions and is based on sound ecological and evolutionary reasoning. Many case-control studies are underpowered necessitating more meta-analyses that sort out consistent from spurious dysbiosis-disease associations. We also need for the microbiome a transition from statistical associations to causal relationships with diseases that fulfil a set of modified Koch's postulates for commensals. Disturbingly, the most sophisticated statistical analyses explain only a small percentage of the variance in the microbiome. Microbe-microbe interactions irrelevant to the host and stochastic processes might play a greater role than anticipated. To satisfy the concept of Karl Popper about conjectures and refutations in the scientific process, we should also conduct more experiments that try to refute the role of the commensal gut microbiota for human health and disease.},

I offer “hydrosocial moments” as a way to extend Boelens and colleagues' “hydrosocial territories” through time. Water facts and truths change through a dialectical process of truth assertion and contradiction. In the Mikea case, one changing truth was who Mikea are: exotic desert hunter‐gatherers, victimized indigenous peoples losing forest to rapacious farmers, or poor people in need of development. Interveners borrowed truths from neighboring hydrosocial territories. The concepts of hydrosocial territories and moments are significant because they have real effects, in this case, poverty. },

 abstract = {Human Biomonitoring (HB), the process for determining whether and to what extent chemical substances penetrated our bodies, serves as a useful tool to quantify human exposure to pollutants. In cases of nutrition and physiologic status, HB plays a critical role in the identification of excess or deficiency of essential nutrients. In pollutant HB studies, levels of substances measured in body fluids (blood, urine, and breast milk) or tissues (hair, nails or teeth) aid in the identification of potential health risks or associated adverse effects. However, even as a widespread practice in several countries, most HB studies reflect exposure to a single compound or mixtures which are measured at a single time point in lifecycle. On the other hand, throughout an individual's lifespan, the contact with different physical, chemical, and social stressors occurs at varying intensities, differing times and durations. Further, the interaction between stressors and body receptors leads to dynamic responses of the entire biological system including proteome, metabolome, transcriptome, and adductome. Bearing this in mind, a relatively new vision in exposure science, defined as the exposome, is postulated to expand the traditional practice of measuring a single exposure to one or few chemicals at one-time point to an approach that addresses measures of exposure to multiple stressors throughout the lifespan. With the exposome concept, the science of exposure advances to an Environment-Wide Association Perspective, which might exhibit a stronger relationship with good health or disease conditions for an individual (phenotype). Thus, this critical review focused on the current progress of HB and exposome investigations, anticipating some challenges, strategies, and future needs to be taken into account for designing future surveys.},

 abstract = {The co-evolution of the gut microbiota with its human host has revolutionized our current scientific viewpoint about the contribution of diet and lifestyle on human health. Most studies so far have focused on populations living in the United States and Europe or compared those with communities from other geographic areas in the world. In order to determine the taxonomic and predicted functional profile of the gut microbiome of a hitherto unstudied human community, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota in a community of Fulani nomadic pastoralists, and their semi-urbanized neighbors - the Jarawa. The Jarawa reside in a city (Jos) in the north-central part of Nigeria, and are adapted in part to a westernized lifestyle. The nomadic Fulani lifestyle resembles a mix of Paleolithic and Neolithic lifestyle patterns with a greater predisposition to diseases. The fecal microbiota of the Fulani and the Jarawa were characterized by paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by downstream bioinformatics analysis of the sequence reads. The Fulani harbored increased numbers of signatures of microbes that are known to be associated with a foraging lifestyle such as the Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Prevotellaceae, while the Jarawa were dominated by signatures of Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Christensenellaceae. Notably, the gut microbiota of the Fulani showed less taxonomic diversity than those of the Jarawa. Although they reside in the same geographical zone, microbial community composition was significantly different between the two groups. Pathogens were predicted to be more abundant in the gut microbiota of the Fulani than of the Jarawa. Predicted pathogenic pathways and pathways associated with the breakdown of fiber-rich diet were enriched in the Fulani, including glutathione metabolism, while pathways associated with the consumption of low-fiber diet and xenobiotics, including fructose and mannose metabolic pathways, and nitrotoluene degradation pathways, respectively, were enriched in the Jarawa. Significant differences in composition between both groups were likely due to differences in diet and lifestyle and exposure to pathogens. These results suggest that microbial diversity may not always be higher in non-industrialized societies than in westernized societies, as previously assumed.},

 abstract = {(Arabic language)The Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016) is an updated version of the original UN Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions of 1991 (commonly known as the Minnesota Protocol). The revised Protocol establishes detailed procedures for crime-scene investigations, interviews of suspects and witnesses, the excavation of graves, post-mortem examinations, and the analysis of skeletal remains. Such investigations, along with subsequent accountability processes, play a vital role in upholding the right to life. The new Protocol is an indispensable tool to guide investigations into suspicious deaths, ensure accountability for violations of the right to life, and bring truth and justice to the families of victims. It is aimed at police officers, medical practitioners, lawyers, judicial officers, NGOs and others involved in death investigations, setting a common standard of performance in the investigation of potentially unlawful death.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
                Little is known about the relative contributions of selective and neutral forces on human-associated microbiota assembly. Here, we characterize microbial community assembly in 52 Tsimane infant-mother pairs, using longitudinally collected stool and tongue swab samples profiled with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The Tsimane are an indigenous Bolivian population who practice infant care associated behaviors expected to increase mother-infant dispersal. Infant consumption of dairy products, vegetables, and chicha (a fermented drink inoculated with oral microbes) was significantly associated with gut microbiota composition. At both body sites, maternal microbes at higher relative abundance were more likely to be shared. Shared microbes were also higher in abundance in infants at both body sites, but decreased in average relative abundance with age and were not significantly higher by 12 months of age. Infant microbiotas were modeled using a neutral community model of assembly, which showed that the prevalence of more than two thirds of infant-colonizing microbes could be explained using neutral processes alone. The same method was applied to datasets from Finnish and Bangladeshi infants, confirming that the majority of microbes colonizing infants from different countries were neutrally distributed. Among the Tsimane infant and adult gut microbiota samples, neutral processes were less prominent in villages with more market access. These results underscore the importance of neutral processes during infant microbiota assembly, and suggest that cultural changes associated with market integration may be affecting traditional modes of microbiota assembly by decreasing the role of these neutral processes, perhaps through changes in diet, sanitation, or access to medical care.},

A holistic mechanistic understanding will require study of the gut microbiota as an interactive and spatially organized biological system, which is difficult to do in complex natural communities. Synthetic gut microbial ecosystems can function as model systems to further current understanding of the composition, stability and functional activities of the microbiota. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current synthetic ecology strategies that can be used towards a more comprehensive understanding of the human gut ecosystem. Such approaches that integrate in vitro experiments using cultured isolates with mathematical modelling will enable the ultimate goal: translating mechanistic and ecological knowledge into novel and effective therapies.},

 abstract = {Infants experience a dramatic change in their food in the first year after birth when they shift from breast milk to solid food. This results in a large change in presence of indigestible polysaccharides, a primary energy resource of gut microbes. How the gut microbiota adapts to this dietary shift has not been well examined. Here, by using metagenomics data, we studied carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) of gut microbiota, which are essential enzymes catalyzing the breakdown of polysaccharides, during this dietary shift. We developed a new approach to categorize CAZyme families by food intake and found CAZyme families associated with milk or solid food. We also found CAZymes with most abundance in 12 months infants that are not associated with solid food or milk but may be related to modulating carbohydrates in the mucus. Additionally, the abundance of gut CAZymes were found to be affected by many other factors, including delivery modes and life style in adults. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the dynamic change of gut CAZymes in early human life and provide potential markers for food interference or gut microbiota restoration.},

The major players for clearing infection are the genes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC region encodes for the most polymorphic genes in human genome, human leukocyte antigen (HLA). A population with diverse HLA class II alleles is able to generate a response to various infections and have a survival advantage. However, the presence of certain class II alleles has been linked to the development of autoimmune diseases. The development of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or celiac disease is determined by genetic and environmental factors. Among the genetic factors, HLA class II genes confer the highest relative risk to the majority of autoimmune diseases. Thus while the disease-associated HLA class II molecules are efficient in clearing infections, they predispose to autoimmunity.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cities are home to over half the global population; that proportion is expected to rise to 70% by mid-century. The urban environment differs greatly from that in which humans evolved, with potentially important consequences for health. Rates for allergic, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases appear to rise with urbanization and be higher in the more urbanized nations of the world which has led some to suggest that cities promote the occurrence of these diseases. However, there are no syntheses outlining what urban-associated diseases are and what characteristics of cities promote their occurrence.
OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the current understanding of "urban-associated diseases", and discover the common, potentially modifiable features of cities that may be driving these associations.
METHODS: We focus on any diseases that have been associated with cities or are particularly prominent in today's urban societies. We draw on expertise across diverse health fields to examine the evidence for urban connections and drivers.
DISCUSSION: We found evidence for urban associations across allergic, auto-immune, inflammatory, lifestyle and infectious disease categories. Some conditions (e.g. obesity and diabetes) have complex relationships with cities that have been insufficiently explored. Other conditions (e.g. allergies and asthma) have more evidence demonstrating their relationship with cities and the mechanisms driving that association. Unsurprisingly, air pollution was the characteristic of cities most frequently associated with disease. Other identified urban risk factors are not as widely known: altered microbial exposure and a disconnect from environmental microbiomes, vitamin D deficiency, noise and light pollution, and a transient, over-crowded, impoverished population. However, many complexities and caveats to these relationships beg clarification; we highlight the current knowledge gaps and outline ways to fill those gaps. Identifying urban-associated diseases and their drivers will allow us to prepare for the urban-disease burden of the future and create healthy cities that mitigate that disease burden.},

 abstract = {The term Khoisan, alternatively spelled “Khoesan,” is used by contemporary linguists as a convenient blanket term for the non-Bantu and non-Cushitic click-using languages of Africa and does not imply the existence of any familial relationships between the member groups. Some scholars include two isolate click languages of Tanzania, namely, Hadza and Sandawe, within the scope of a so-called “Macro-Khoisan,” although there is little evidence to suggest that these two languages are related even to each other, let alone to any of the southern African languages. This chapter begins by setting out the shifting speaker numbers and distributions of the diverse and often trans-nationally located Khoisan languages of southern Africa, as far as these have been reliably estimated for the present day on the basis of population surveys, and as far as they can be reasonably projected for the relatively recent, largely colonial period on the basis of historical records. The discussion then draws on comparative linguistic evidence (in both a narrow and wider sense) to assess various popular beliefs concerning the older, undocumented past of the Khoisan languages, which are often romantically imagined to be the last vestiges of some primordial African substrate – and the possibility of an alternative scenario is briefly sketched. The chapter concludes with a few brief notes on the uncertain future of these highly endangered African languages in an era of conflicting economic, political, and social-cultural demands.},

While taxa for oral diseases have been well studied using culture-based as well as amplicon sequencing methods, metagenomic and genomic information remain scarce compared to the fecal microbiome. Here we provide metagenomic shotgun data for 3346 oral metagenomics samples, and together with 808 published samples, assemble 56,213 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). 64% of the 3,589 species-level genome bins contained no publicly available genomes, others with only a handful. The resulting genome collection is representative of samples around the world and across physiological conditions, contained many genomes from Candidate phyla radiation (CPR) which lack monoculture, and enabled discovery of new taxa such as a family within the Acholeplasmataceae order. New biomarkers were identified for rheumatoid arthritis or colorectal cancer, which would be more convenient than fecal samples. The large number of metagenomic samples also allowed assembly of many strains from important oral taxa such as Porphyromonas and Neisseria . Predicted functions enrich in drug metabolism and small molecule synthesis. Thus, these data lay down a genomic framework for future inquiries of the human oral microbiome. },

 abstract = {This targeted review of oral paleopathology in the Central Andes explores research that focuses on a set of interrelated, multifactorial processes: dental caries, macrowear, alveolar abscess, antemortem tooth loss (AMTL), periodontal disease, and the presence of dental calculus. These conditions help characterize oral health because they result from the culturally mediated interaction of individuals' oral cavity with their external environment. To better understand how osteologists working in the Central Andes have interpreted the frequencies of these conditions, I review the etiology of each, as well as discuss the important issues in their analyses. I then highlight studies that integrate of a number of oral paleopathological conditions, that examine associations between oral conditions and other skeletal indicators of health, or that use multivariate statistical techniques to analyze conditions. In the Central Andes, these proxies for oral health have generally focused on several key research themes including the introduction of domesticated foods may have occurred earlier than expected, but that populations may have maintained mixed subsistence strategies for a significant period. Researchers have also identified that changes accompanying Inca imperialism were likely not as detrimental to local populations as was Spanish colonialism. Finally, the long-practiced, culturally important, activity of chewing coca has been shown to create an identifiable pattern of oral paleopathological conditions.},

Here, we describe the genomic diversity of 83 P. copri isolates from 11 human donors. We demonstrate that genomically distinct isolates, which can be categorized into different P. copri complex clades, utilize defined sets of polysaccharides. These differences are exemplified by variations in susC genes involved in polysaccharide transport as well as polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that were predicted in part from genomic and metagenomic data. Functional validation of these PULs showed that P. copri isolates utilize distinct sets of polysaccharides from dietary plant, but not animal, sources.

Materials and methods Rapid Appraisal Approach (RAA) together with the semi-structured questionnaire technique was used to collect data from June 2014 to July 2015 and relative importance of reported medicinal plants was shown by calculating the use value and frequency of citation. Results and discussions A total of 71 medicinal plants belonging to 48 families were reported to be effective against 40 human ailments. Rosaceae was the predominant plant family contributing maximum number of medicinal plants to the medicinal flora of that area. Indigofera heterantha, Artemisia vulgaris, Berberis lycium, Aesculus indica, Juglans regia, Ajuga integrifolia, Thymus linearis and Paeonia emodi exhibited the highest usage value among other reported medicinal plants. Conclusion Quantitative analysis indicated that medicinal plants are an integral part of the life of the inhabitants. Local flora is recognised as highly valuable and is reported to be used against various ailments. Most commonly reported diseases were arthritis, kidney stone, typhoid fever, stomach problems, hepatitis, jaundice and diabetes. Among these aliments, the most common in the study area were stomach disorders, diabetes and kidney stones.

 abstract = {The study of prehistoric hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies on the Tibetan Plateau is important for understanding the mechanisms and processes of human adaption to high altitude environments. But to date, only a few Paleolithic sites have been found on the Tibetan Plateau with clear stratigraphy and reliable dating. These sites are mainly distributed in the Qinghai Lake Basin on the northeastern part of the plateau, and the sporadic fauna and flora remains excavated provide limited information about the subsistence strategies of hunter-gatherers. In 2014, relatively abundant animal remains were unearthed in the Lower Cultural Layer (LCL, 15400–13100 cal yr BP) of the “151 site” located in the Qinghai Lake Basin, providing important information about human subsistence strategies on the Tibetan Plateau during the Last Deglaciation. Zooarchaeological analysis of these faunal remains indicates that hunter-gatherers at the “151 site” mainly targeted large ungulates of Bos and wild horse/ass, and only brought back the most nutritious parts of animal carcasses including upper and intermediate limb bones, heads, and trunks (ribs and vertebrae). People then processed and consumed the carcasses around single hearths. Our comprehensive analyses of contemporaneous sites in the Qinghai Lake Basin show that a subsistence strategy involving opportunistic hunting of ungulates, high mobility, and short occupation of campsites was used by terminal Pleistocene hunter-gatherers to adapt to the high-altitude environment on the Tibetan Plateau. This subsistence strategy may have been a first step of gradual hunter-gatherer adaptation to the extreme conditions on the Tibetan Plateau after the Last Glacial Maximum, and laid the foundation for the widespread distribution of hunter-gatherers on the plateau during the Holocene.},

We then link two of the most important functions of play-exploration and innovation-to the potential for cumulative cultural evolution in general and for the emergence of complex language in particular. If correct, the shorter childhood of Neanderthals-involving restrictions on time to experiment and innovate-may have restricted their language (and other symbolic) system/s. Consequently, fully investigating the role that play may have had in the transmission of language and the development of symbolic cultures in both modern humans and Neanderthals provides a new avenue of research for Paleolithic archaeology and related disciplines.},

 abstract = {Gut bacteria from the genus Prevotella are found in high abundance in faeces of non-industrialised communities but low abundance in industrialised, Westernised communities. Prevotella copri is one of the principal Prevotella species within the human gut. As it has been associated with developmental health and disease states, we sought to (i) develop a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to rapidly determine P. copri abundance and (ii) investigate its abundance in a large group of Australian pregnant mothers.The Barwon Infant Study is a pre-birth cohort study (n = 1074). Faecal samples were collected from mothers at 36 weeks gestation. Primers with a probe specific to the V3 region of P. copri 16S rRNA gene were designed and optimised for real-time PCR. Universal 16S rRNA gene primers amplified pan-bacterial DNA in parallel. Relative abundance of P. copri was calculated using a 2-ΔCt method.Relative abundance of P. copri by PCR was observed in 165/605 (27.3%) women. The distribution was distinctly bimodal, defining women with substantial (n = 115/165, 69.7%) versus very low P. copri expression (n = 50/165, 30.3%). In addition, abundance of P. copri by PCR correlated with 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing data (r2 = 0.67, P < 0.0001, n = 61).We have developed a rapid and cost-effective technique for identifying the relative abundance of P. copri using real-time PCR. The expression of P. copri was evident in only a quarter of the mothers, and either at substantial or very low levels. PCR detection of P. copri may facilitate assessment of this species in large, longitudinal studies across multiple populations and in various clinical settings.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The gut microbiota varies across human populations. The first years of life are a critical period in its development. While delivery mode and diet contribute to observed variation, the additional contribution of specific environmental factors remains poorly understood. One factor is waterborne enteric pathogen exposure. In this pilot study, we explore the relationship between household water security and the gut microbiota of children.
METHODS: From Nicaraguan households (n = 39), we collected drinking water samples, as well as fecal samples from children aged one month to 5.99 years (n = 53). We tested water samples for total coliforms (CFU/mL) and the presence of common enteric pathogens. Composition and diversity of the gut microbiota were characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing. Households were classified as having drinking water that was "low" (<29 CFU/mL) or "high" (≥29 CFU/mL) in coliforms. We used permutational analyses of variance and Mann-Whitney U-tests to identify differences in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota of children living in these two home types.
RESULTS: Insecure access led households to store drinking water and 85% tested positive for coliforms. High concentrations of Salmonella and Campylobacter were found in water and fecal samples. Controlling for age, the gut microbiota of children from high coliform homes were compositionally different and less diverse than those from low coliform homes.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that research exploring the ways water insecurity affects human biology should consider the gut microbiome and that investigations of inter-population variation in the gut microbial community of children should consider pathogen exposure and infection.},

 abstract = {BackgroundHumans have coevolved with microbial communities to establish a mutually advantageous relationship that is still poorly characterized and can provide a better understanding of the human microbiome. Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches.ResultsWe reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories.ConclusionsThe newly reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.},

 abstract = {Colorfulness and saturation have been neglected in research on color appearance and color naming. Perceptual particularities, such as cross-cultural stability, "focality," "uniqueness," "salience," and "prominence" have been observed for red, yellow, green, and blue when those colors were more saturated than other colors in the stimulus samples. The present study tests whether high saturation is a characteristic property of red, yellow, green, and blue, which would explain the above observations. First, we carefully determined the category prototypes and unique hues for red, yellow, green, and blue. Using different approaches in two experiments, we assessed discriminable saturation as the number of just noticeable differences away from the adaptation point (i.e., neutral gray). Results show that some hues can reach much higher levels of maximal saturation than others. However, typical and unique red, yellow, green, and blue are not particularly colorful. Many other intermediate colors have a larger range of discriminable saturation than these colors. These findings suggest that prior claims of perceptual salience of category prototypes and unique hues actually reflect biases in stimulus sets rather than perceptual properties. Additional analyses show that consistent prototype choices across fundamentally different languages are strongly related to the variation of discriminable saturation in the stimulus sets. Our findings also undermine the idea that every color can be produced by a mixture of unique hues. Finally, the measurements in this study provide a large amount of data on saturation across hues, which allows for reevaluating existing estimates of saturation in future studies.},

SCFAs may mitigate inflammatory conditions such as obesity through modulation of histone acetylation. Lipid metabolism and inflammation play critical roles during pregnancy. However, few studies have examined maternal SCFAs in relation to pregnancy outcomes. This pilot study examined plasma SCFAs in spontaneous preterm birth. This study used stored plasma from an existing cohort to measure seven (proponic acid, methanoic acid, butanoic acid, isovaleric acid, pentanoic acid, methylpropylbutanoic and methylbutanoic acids) SCFAs in 20 women with spontaneous preterm delivery (< 37 weeks gestation) and 30 women with a healthy term delivery (≥ 37 weeks gestation). All women had singleton pregnancies and provided serum at the time of admission to labor and delivery. SCFAs were measured by purge and trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. SCFAs were log transformed. Logistic regression with penalized likelihood approach examined associations between SCFAs and preterm birth, adjusting for age, BMI, and race. We also explored if SCFAs had a linear association with pre-pregnancy BMI. Propionic acid had a negative association with preterm birth [odds ratioadj: 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.41–0.86). There was a negative association between propionic acid and BMI after adjustments (β = −0.14, p = 0.0011). No other associations were found. Lower levels of propionic acid were associated with preterm birth and correlated with higher BMI. Larger studies should explore if circulatory SCFAs protect against inflammatory pathways during pregnancy and are associated with adverse outcomes when measured earlier in pregnancy.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Hamadryas baboon is a highly social primate that lives in complex multilevel societies exhibiting a wide range of group behaviors akin to humans. Here, we report the comprehensive 16s rRNA gene analyses of group-living baboon microbiota across different body sites. Additionally, we compared the baboon and human microbiome of the oral cavity, gut and vagina. Our analyses show that the baboon microbiome is distinct from the human and baboon cohabitants share similar microbial profiles in multiple body sites. The oral, gut and vagina shared more bacterial ASVs in group-living baboons than in humans. The shared ASVs in baboons had significantly positive correlations, suggesting a potential bacterial exchange throughout the body. No significant differences in baboon gut microbiome composition within the maternity line and between maternity lines were detected, suggesting that the offspring acquire their gut microbiota primarily through bacterial exchange among cohabitants. Besides, Lactobacillus was not so predominant in baboon vagina as in the human vagina but was the most abundant genus in baboon gut. These data and findings can form the basis of future microbiome studies in baboons and be used as a reference to research where the microbiome is expected to impact human modeling with baboons. },

 abstract = {CrAssphage (cross-assembly phage) is a bacteriophage that was first discovered in human gut metagenomic data. CrAssphage belongs to a diverse family of crAss-like bacteriophages thought to infect gut commensal bacteria belonging to Bacteroides species. However, not much is known about the biogeography of crAssphage and whether certain strains are associated with specific human populations. In this study, we screened publicly available human gut metagenomic data from 3,341 samples for the presence of crAssphage sensu stricto (NC_024711.1). We found that crAssphage prevalence is low in traditional, hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru, as compared to industrialized, urban populations. Statistical comparisons showed no association of crAssphage prevalence with variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and health status of individuals. Phylogenetic analyses show that crAssphage strains reconstructed from the same individual over multiple time-points, cluster together. CrAssphage strains from individuals from the same study population do not always cluster together. Some evidence of clustering is seen at the level of broadly defined geographic regions, however, the relative positions of these clusters within the crAssphage phylogeny are not well-supported. We hypothesize that this lack of strong biogeographic structuring is suggestive of an expansion event within crAssphage. Using a Bayesian dating approach, we estimate that this expansion has occurred fairly recently. Overall, we determine that crAssphage presence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle and the absence of strong biogeographic structuring within global crAssphage strains is likely due to a recent population expansion within this bacteriophage.},

The anthropometric and clinical indices of each subject were measured. Fecal samples of each subject were also collected and were processed for 16S rDNA sequencing. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associations of enterotypes with type 2 diabetes. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between lipopolysaccharide levels and insulin sensitivity after adjusting for age, BMI, TG, HDL-C, DAO, and TNF-<i>α</i>. The correlation analysis between factors and microbiota was identified using Spearman correlation analysis. The correlation analysis between factors was identified using partial correlation analysis.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota, by influencing multiple metabolic processes in the host, is an important determinant of human health and disease. However, gut dysbiosis associated with metabolic complications shows inconsistent patterns. This is likely driven by factors shaping gut microbial composition that have largely been under-evaluated, at a population level, in school-age children, especially from developing countries.
RESULTS: Through characterization, by 16S sequencing, of the largest gut microbial population-based school-aged children cohort in Latin America (ORSMEC, <i>N</i> = 926, aged 6-12 y), we identified associations of 14 clinical and environmental covariates (P<sub>FDR</sub>&lt;0.1), collectively explaining 15.7% of the inter-individual gut microbial variation. Extrinsic factors such as markers of socioeconomic status showed a major influence in the most abundant taxa and in the enterotypes' distribution. Age was positively correlated with higher diversity, but only in normal-weight children (rho = 0.138, P <i>=</i>2 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). In contrast, this correlation although not significant, was negative in overweight and obese children (rho = -0.125, P <i>=</i> 0.104 and rho = -0.058, P <i>=</i> 0.409, respectively). Finally, co-abundance groups (CAGs) were associated with the presence of metabolic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers evidence that the presence of overweight and obesity could impair the microbial diversity maturation associated with age. Furthermore, it provides novel results toward a better understanding of gut microbiota in the pediatric population that will ultimately help to develop therapeutic approaches to improve metabolic status.},

Compound constructions typically involve an auxiliary form followed by an inflected main verb. However, the six East African Bantu languages under examination in this paper exhibit a word order in which the auxiliary appears after the verb. This order is typologically unusual for languages with SVO word order and comparatively unusual in the context of the Bantu languages. This paper presents a synchronic description of this word order and develops an account of its possible origins. It is proposed that the verb-auxiliary order originated from a verb-fronting construction which was used historically to convey predication focus. The account further corroborates the claim that the progressive aspect is an inherently focal category in Bantu and, from a wider perspective, shows the interplay between the encoding of information structure and tense-aspect information.},

 abstract = {Laterality effects generally include two major components: laterality in the horizontal display of objects and laterality in terms of human embodiment, for example, with regard to handedness (left versus right). Horizontal display is an environmental factor, whereas handedness is largely a genetic trait grounded in evolution. Both can act together in driving consumer choice. Previous research has shown that right-handers react differently from left-handers to a variety of stimuli. Right-handers are conditioned to engage stimuli in asymmetric terms, favoring their dominant right hand in guiding their perceptions of those stimuli; left-handers view the world in more symmetric terms with less favoring of their dominant hand. In three studies, we show that handedness plays a role in consumers’ choice responses to lateral displays, an effect that we call the choice polarity effect. Implications are drawn for laterality research and for the complex interrelationships of handedness with evolutionary, coevolutionary and epigenetic forces.},

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the composition of gut microbiota during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.
METHODS: A subcohort of 201 children with behavioural outcome measures was identified within a longitudinal, Australian birth-cohort study. The faecal microbiota were analysed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. Behavioural outcomes were measured at 2 years of age.
FINDINGS: In an unselected birth cohort, we found a clear association between decreased normalised abundance of Prevotella in faecal samples collected at 12 months of age and increased behavioural problems at 2 years, in particular Internalizing Problem scores. This association appeared independent of multiple potentially confounding variables, including maternal mental health. Recent exposure to antibiotics was the best predictor of decreased Prevotella.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a strong association between the composition of the gut microbiota in infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes; and support the importance of responsible use of antibiotics during early life.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fusobacteria are not common nor relatively abundant in non-colorectal cancer (CRC) populations, however, we identified multiple <i>Fusobacterium</i> taxa nearly absent in western and rural populations to be comparatively more prevalent and relatively abundant in southern Chinese populations. We investigated whether these represented known or novel lineages in the <i>Fusobacterium</i> genus, and assessed their genomes for features implicated in development of cancer.
METHODS: Prevalence and relative abundances of fusobacterial species were calculated from 3157 CRC and non-CRC gut metagenomes representing 16 populations from various biogeographies. Microbial genomes were assembled and compared with existing reference genomes to assess novel fusobacterial diversity. Phylogenetic distribution of virulence genes implicated in CRC was investigated.
RESULTS: Irrespective of CRC disease status, southern Chinese populations harboured increased prevalence (maximum 39% vs 7%) and relative abundances (average 0.4% vs 0.04% of gut community) of multiple recognised and novel fusobacterial taxa phylogenetically distinct from <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>. Genomes assembled from southern Chinese gut metagenomes increased existing fusobacterial diversity by 14.3%. Homologues of the FadA adhesin linked to CRC were consistently detected in several monophyletic lineages sister to and inclusive of <i>F. varium</i> and <i>F. ulcerans</i>, but not <i>F. mortiferum</i>. We also detected increased prevalence and relative abundances of <i>F. varium</i> in CRC compared with non-CRC cohorts, which together with distribution of FadA homologues supports a possible association with gut disease.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of fusobacteria in guts of southern Chinese populations are higher compared with several western and rural populations in line with the notion of environment/biogeography driving human gut microbiome composition. Several non-nucleatum taxa possess FadA homologues and were enriched in CRC cohorts; whether this imposes a risk in developing CRC and other gut diseases deserves further investigation.},

As the prevalence of these diseases increases globally, efficient new strategies are necessary to target CMD and modifiable risk factors. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated regarding the influence of gut microbiota (GM) on CMD, providing new targets for therapeutic interventions.<b>Areas covered</b>: This narrative review discusses the pathophysiologic link between CMD, GM, and potential microbiota-based targets against atherosclerosis and modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis. Low-grade inflammation can be induced through GM and its derived metabolites. CMD are influenced by GM and microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), secondary bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and the composition of GM can modulate host metabolism. All of the above can lead to promising therapeutic targets.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Most data are derived from animal models or human association studies; therefore, more translational and interventional research in humans is necessary to validate these promising findings. Reproduced findings such as aberrant microbiota patterns or circulating biomarkers could be targeted depending on individual metabolic profiles, moving toward personalized medicine in CMD.},

 abstract = {Gut dysbiosis has been associated with several disease outcomes including diabetes in human populations. Currently, there are no studies of the gut microbiome composition in relation to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Africans. Here, we describe the profile of the gut microbiome in non-diabetic adults (controls) and investigate the association between gut microbiota and T2D in urban West Africans. Gut microbiota composition was determined in 291 Nigerians (98 cases, 193 controls) using fecal 16S V4 rRNA gene sequencing done on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Data analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTU) was conducted to describe microbiome composition and identify differences between T2D and controls. The most abundant phyla were <i>Firmicutes, Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Bacteroidetes</i>. <i>Clostridiaceae</i>, and <i>Peptostreptococcaceaea</i> were significantly lower in cases than controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Feature selection analysis identified a panel of 18 OTUs enriched in cases that included <i>Desulfovibrio piger, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, and Eubacterium</i>. A panel of 17 OTUs that was enriched in the controls included <i>Collinsella, Ruminococcus lactaris, Anaerostipes</i>, and <i>Clostridium</i>. OTUs with strain-level annotation showing the largest fold-change included <i>Cellulosilyticum ruminicola</i> (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -3.1; <i>p</i> = 4.2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), <i>Clostridium paraputrificum</i> (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -2.5; <i>p</i> = 0.005), <i>and Clostridium butyricum</i> (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -1.76; <i>p</i> = 0.01), all lower in cases. These findings are notable because supplementation with <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> and <i>Desulfovibrio piger</i> has been shown to improve hyperglycemia and reduce insulin resistance in murine models. This first investigation of gut microbiome and diabetes in urban Africans shows that T2D is associated with compositional changes in gut microbiota highlighting the possibility of developing strategies to improve glucose control by modifying bacterial composition in the gut.},

 abstract = {The equine microbiome can change in response to dietary alteration and may play a role in insulin dysregulation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adding pasture to a hay diet on the faecal bacterial microbiome of both healthy and insulin-dysregulated ponies. Faecal samples were collected from 16 ponies before and after dietary change to enable bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing of the V3-V4 region. The dominant phyla in all samples were the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The evenness of the bacterial populations decreased after grazing pasture, and when a pony was moderately insulin dysregulated (<i>P</i>=0.001). Evenness scores negatively correlated with post-prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration after a hay-only diet (<i>r</i>²=-0.7, <i>P</i>=0.001). A change in diet explained 3% of faecal microbiome variability. We conclude that metabolically healthy ponies have greater microbial stability when challenged with a subtle dietary change, compared with moderately insulin-dysregulated ponies.},

                  Background
                  Comparisons of traditional hunter-gatherers and pre-agricultural communities in Africa with urban and suburban Western North American and European cohorts have clearly shown that diet, lifestyle and environment are associated with gut microbiome composition. Yet, little is known about the gut microbiome composition of most African adults. South Africa comprises a richly diverse ethnolinguistic population that is experiencing an ongoing epidemiological transition and concurrent spike in the prevalence of obesity, largely attributed to a shift towards more Westernized diets and increasingly inactive lifestyle practices. To better characterize the microbiome of African adults living in more mainstream lifestyle settings and to investigate associations between the microbiome and obesity, we conducted a pilot study in two South African cohorts that are representative of urban and rural populations. The study was designed collaboratively with community leaders. As the rate of overweight and obesity is particularly high in women, we collected single time-point stool samples from 170 HIV-negative women (51 at Soweto; 119 at Bushbuckridge), performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on these samples and compared the data to concurrently collected anthropometric data.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    We found the overall gut microbiome of our cohorts to be reflective of their ongoing epidemiological transition. Specifically, our results show a relatively higher than expected abundance of Western gut-associated taxa such as
                    Barnesiella
                    and the presence of
                    Bifidobacteria
                    and
                    Bacteroides
                    together with the more traditionally non-Western gut-associated
                    Prevotella
                    ,
                    Treponema
                    and
                    Succinivibrio
                    . Interestingly, we observed a relatively higher abundance of the
                    Melainabacteria
                    ,
                    Vampirovibrio
                    , a predatory bacterium, in the rural cohort. We also found
                    Prevotella
                    , despite its generally high prevalence relative to all taxa present in the cohort, to be associated with obesity.
                  
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Altogether, this work identifies putative microbial features associated with host health in a historically understudied community. Furthermore, we note the crucial role of community engagement to the success of a study in an African setting, the importance of more population-specific studies to inform targeted interventions as well as present a basic foundation for future research in this regard.

 abstract = {Microbiome science asserts humans are made up of more microbial cells and genes than human ones, and that each person harbors their own unique microbial population. Human microbiome studies gesture toward the post-racial aspirations of personalized medicine—characterizing states of human health and illness microbially. By viewing humans as “supraorganisms” made up of millions of microbial partners, some microbiome science seems to disrupt binding historical categories often grounded in racist biology, allowing interspeciality to supersede race. But inevitably, unexamined categories of race and ethnicity surface in a myriad of studies on microbiota. This paper approaches race as a ghost variable across microbiome research and asks, what is race doing in studies of the microbiome? Why is it there, and how is it functioning? I examine this research to argue that social scientists must work with biological scientists to help put microbial differences into perspective—to investigate how microbiomes and race are entangled embodiments of the social, environmental, and biological. Ultimately, transdisciplinary collaboration is required to address racial health disparities in microbiome research without reifying race as a straightforward biological or social designation.},

The comparison of shell midden locations, sizes and contents from a well-studied section of the Cape west coast of South Africa, against the framework of Metcalf and Barlow's (1992) model of the ‘optimal trade-off between field processing and transport’ leads us to suggest that through time different decisions were made by local shellfish gatherers.

Westernized populations have high rates of allergic disease and low rates of gastrointestinal carriage of Prevotella, a commensal bacterial genus that produces short chain fatty acids and endotoxins, each of which may promote the development of fetal immune tolerance. In this study, we use a prebirth cohort (n = 1064 mothers) to conduct a nested case-cohort study comparing 58 mothers of babies with clinically proven food IgE mediated food allergy with 258 randomly selected mothers. Analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples shows maternal carriage of Prevotella copri during pregnancy strongly predicts the absence of food allergy in the offspring. This association was confirmed using targeted qPCR and was independent of infant carriage of P. copri. Larger household size, which is a well-established protective factor for allergic disease, strongly predicts maternal carriage of P. copri.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Multiple factors contribute to the etiology of addiction, including genetics, sex, and a number of addiction-related behavioral traits. For example, individuals that are predisposed to assign incentive salience to food stimuli ("sign-trackers", ST), are not only more impulsive compared to those that do not ("goal-trackers", GT), but are also more sensitive to drugs and drug stimuli as well. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota as a key regulator of brain and behavior, and have shown that many microbiota-associated changes occur in a sex-dependent manner. However, few studies have examined how the microbiome might influence addiction-related behaviors. To this end, we sought to determine if gut microbiome composition was correlated with addiction-related behaviors. Methods: Outbred male (N=101) and female (N=101) heterogeneous stock rats underwent a series of behavioral tests measuring impulsivity, attention, reward-learning, incentive salience, and locomotor response. Cecal microbiome composition was estimated using 16S rRNA. Behavior and microbiome were characterized and correlated with behavioral phenotypes. Robust sex differences were observed in both behavior and microbiome; further analyses were conducted within sex using the pre-established goal/sign-tracking (GT/ST) phenotype and partial least squares differential analysis (PLS-DA) clustered behavioral phenotype. Results: Microbial alpha diversity was significantly decreased in female STs. On the other hand, a measure of impulsivity had many significant correlations to microbiome in both males and females. Several measures of impulsivity were correlated with the genus Barnesiella in females. In the female STs, attention, as measured by omissions in the reaction time test revealed notable microbiome correlations. In both males and females, many measures were correlated with bacterial family Ruminocococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Conclusions: These data demonstrate correlations between several addiction-related behaviors and the microbiome specific to sex.Funding Statement: Funding sources: P50DA037844, 12/RC/2273.

 abstract = {Background: Early childhood interventions have primarily focused on the mother-child relationship, but grandmothers are often critical in childcare. Prior research is mixed on how grandmother involvement influences child outcomes. There is a paucity of research on grandmother caregiving in low- and middle-income countries. We described maternally-reported grandmother caregiving activities and examined the role of grandmother involvement on child growth and development cross-sectionally and longitudinally.Methods: We utilized the Bachpan study, a birth cohort in rural Pakistan. Grandmother involvement was based on maternal report at 3 and 12 months postpartum of 20 items related to daily instrumental and non-instrumental caregiving. A summed score was created and categorized into non-involved, low, and high. Outcomes included 12- and 24-month child growth, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 12 months, and Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Socioemotional at 24 months. Complete data were available for 699 households. We used adjusted linear mixed models to estimate mean differences (MD).Findings: The majority of grandmothers were involved in caregiving at 3 and 12 months. Children with highly involved grandmothers at 3 months (vs. non-involved) had higher 12-month weight-for-length z-scores (MD=0·33, 95% CI: 0·07, 0·59); however, 12-month grandmother involvement was associated with lower 24-month weight-for-length z-scores (MD= -0·21, 95% CI: -0·42, -0·01). Twelve-month high grandmother involvement (vs. non-involved) was associated with improved cognitive (MD=0·48, 95% CI: 0·10, 0·87) and fine motor (MD=0·42, 95% CI: 0·09, 0·76) at 12 months and socioemotional development (MD= -15·52, 95% CI: -25·27, -5·76) at 24 months.Interpretation: Early grandmother involvement had positive associations on child weight, but this association became negative as the child grew older. Grandmother involvement was positively associated with cognitive, fine motor, and socioemotional development.

 abstract = {Pidan, as the preserved duck egg, is a traditional alkaline-pickled food in China. Previous studies have suggested preserved egg white has an anti-inflammatory effect, though the mechanism of action was unclear. In this work, the difference of peptides distribution in the digestive products was identified from those of duck egg. The effects of preserved egg diet on the modulation of gut microbiota as well as the alteration in fecal metabolites were further investigated. Minor variations of gut microbiota in phylum level were observed between preserved and fresh duck egg diet groups, even though, preserved egg diet intake attributed to increases in the relative abundance of Prevotella and Phascolarctobacterium (p < 0.05), while Ruminococcaceae and Allobaculum were quantitatively decreased (p < 0.05). In terms of metabolites, the contents of acetic acid (p < 0.01) and propionic acid (p < 0.05) were significantly increased in the preserved egg diet group. It was speculated that the preserved egg diet might alter the proportion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut of rats by modulating specific intestinal bacteria, and subsequently play an active role in anti-inflammatory effects. Compared to the fresh egg group, the bacterial produced SCFAs of preserved egg group were increased in abundance (p < 0.05), which may have potential anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects. The results provide a novel insight into the relationship between preserved egg intake, gut microbiota and potential positive effects on host health.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota (HGM) has far-reaching impacts on human health and nutrition, which are fueled primarily by the metabolism of otherwise indigestible complex carbohydrates commonly known as dietary fiber. However, the molecular basis of the ability of individual taxa of the HGM to address specific dietary glycan structures remains largely unclear. In particular, the utilization of β(1,3)-glucans, which are widespread in the human diet as yeast, seaweed, and plant cell walls, had not previously been resolved. Through a systems-based approach, here we show that the symbiont <i>Bacteroides uniformis</i> deploys a single, exemplar polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) to access yeast β(1,3)-glucan, brown seaweed β(1,3)-glucan (laminarin), and cereal mixed-linkage β(1,3)/β(1,4)-glucan. Combined biochemical, enzymatic, and structural analysis of PUL-encoded glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and surface glycan-binding proteins (SGBPs) illuminates a concerted molecular system by which <i>B. uniformis</i> recognizes and saccharifies these distinct β-glucans. Strikingly, the functional characterization of homologous β(1,3)-glucan utilization loci (1,3GUL) in other <i>Bacteroides</i> further demonstrated that the ability of individual taxa to utilize β(1,3)-glucan variants and/or β(1,3)/β(1,4)-glucans arises combinatorially from the individual specificities of SGBPs and GHs at the cell surface, which feed corresponding signals to periplasmic hybrid two-component sensors (HTCSs) via TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs). These data reveal the importance of cooperativity in the adaptive evolution of GH and SGBP cohorts to address individual polysaccharide structures. We anticipate that this fine-grained knowledge of PUL function will inform metabolic network analysis and proactive manipulation of the HGM. Indeed, a survey of 2,441 public human metagenomes revealed the international, yet individual-specific, distribution of each 1,3GUL.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Bacteroidetes</i> are a dominant phylum of the human gut microbiota (HGM) that target otherwise indigestible dietary fiber with an arsenal of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), each of which is dedicated to the utilization of a specific complex carbohydrate. Here, we provide novel insight into this paradigm through functional characterization of homologous PULs from three autochthonous <i>Bacteroides</i> species, which target the family of dietary β(1,3)-glucans. Through detailed biochemical and protein structural analysis, we observed an unexpected diversity in the substrate specificity of PUL glycosidases and glycan-binding proteins with regard to β(1,3)-glucan linkage and branching patterns. In combination, these individual enzyme and protein specificities support taxon-specific growth on individual β(1,3)-glucans. This detailed metabolic insight, together with a comprehensive survey of individual 1,3GULs across human populations, further expands the fundamental roadmap of the HGM, with potential application to the future development of microbial intervention therapies.},

However, PCR-based tests are still considered the "golden standard" for many clinical applications. Here, we designed a qPCR-based platform with fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide probes for assessing human gut microbiome composition. The system allows conducting qualitative and semiquantitative analysis for 12 prokaryotic taxa that are prevalent in the human gut and associated with diseases, diet, age and other factors. The platform was validated by comparing microbiome profile data obtained with two different methods - the platform and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing - across 42 stool samples. The test can form the basis for precise and cost-efficient microbiome assay for large-scale surveys including clinical trials with interventions related to diet and disease risks.},

 abstract = {Although females in human and the great ape populations reach the end of fertility at similar ages (approximately 45 years), female humans often live well beyond their post-fertile years, while female primates typically die before or shortly after the end of fertility. The grandmother hypothesis proposes that the care-giving role provided by post-fertile females contributed to the evolution of longevity in human populations. When post-fertile females provide care for weaned infants, mothers are able to have their next baby sooner without compromising the chances of survival of their previous offspring. Thus, the post-menopausal longevity that is unique to human populations may be an evolutionary adaptation. In this work, we construct, simulate, and analyze an ordinary differential equations mathematical model to study the grandmother hypothesis. Our model describes the passage of the individuals of a population through five life stages in the cases with and without grandmothering. We demonstrate via numerical simulation of the mathematical model that grandmothering care is sufficient to significantly increase adult life expectancy. We also investigate the relationship between the number of weaned infants that a post-fertile female can care for at a given time and the steady-state age distributions of a population.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome has been increasingly acknowledged as playing a pivotal role in human health. Therefore, a number of studies have focused on variables that impact its microbial structure and consequent functionality. A wide range of factors, such as diet, age, sex, life stage, behavior, ethnicity, and diseases have been considered, and strong links were set out. However, some aspects regarding the microbiome determinants are still under-explored.
DISCUSSION: Recently, Bosman et al. presented evidence that skin exposure to narrowband UVB light modulated the gut microbiome of a specific human cohort. This cohort presented an increase of biodiversity, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and a decrease of Bacteroidetes. Based on these findings, we revisited our data on a hunter-gatherer gut microbiome (Yanomami) and identified similarities in the gut microbiome of these two cohorts. Both presented a high abundance of Proteobacteria, which had been observed as a unique feature in the Yanomami gut microbiome, and based on Bosman et al study, could be associated with their natural sunlight exposure.
CONCLUSION: In this commentary, we would like to point out that the human lifestyle concerning sunlight exposure should be considered as one force modulating the gut microbiome, highlighting, as proposed by Bosman et al, a novel skin-gut axis which is associated with health and disease.},

 abstract = {The forced relocation of several thousand Africans during Mexico's historic period has so far been documented mostly through archival sources, which provide only sparse detail on their origins and lived experience. Here, we employ a bioarchaeological approach to explore the life history of three 16<sup>th</sup> century Africans from a mass burial at the San José de los Naturales Royal Hospital in Mexico City. Our approach draws together ancient genomic data, osteological analysis, strontium isotope data from tooth enamel, δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N isotope data from dentine, and ethnohistorical information to reveal unprecedented detail on their origins and health. Analyses of skeletal features, radiogenic isotopes, and genetic data from uniparental, genome-wide, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are consistent with a Sub-Saharan African origin for all three individuals. Complete genomes of Treponema pallidum sub. pertenue (causative agent of yaws) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) recovered from these individuals provide insight into their health as related to infectious disease. Phylogenetic analysis of both pathogens reveals their close relationship to strains circulating in current West African populations, lending support to their origins in this region. The further relationship between the treponemal genome retrieved and a treponemal genome previously typed in an individual from Colonial Mexico highlights the role of the transatlantic slave trade in the introduction and dissemination of pathogens into the New World. Putting together all lines of evidence, we were able to create a biological portrait of three individuals whose life stories have long been silenced by disreputable historical events.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple factors contribute to the etiology of addiction, including genetics, sex, and a number of addiction-related behavioral traits. One behavioral trait where individuals assign incentive salience to food stimuli ("sign-trackers", ST) are more impulsive compared to those that do not ("goal-trackers", GT), as well as more sensitive to drugs and drug stimuli. Furthermore, this GT/ST phenotype predicts differences in other behavioral measures. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota as a key regulator of brain and behavior, and have shown that many microbiota-associated changes occur in a sex-dependent manner. However, few studies have examined how the microbiome might influence addiction-related behaviors. To this end, we sought to determine if gut microbiome composition was correlated with addiction-related behaviors determined by the GT/ST phenotype.
METHODS: Outbred male (N=101) and female (N=101) heterogeneous stock rats underwent a series of behavioral tests measuring impulsivity, attention, reward-learning, incentive salience, and locomotor response. Cecal microbiome composition was estimated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Behavior and microbiome were characterized and correlated with behavioral phenotypes. Robust sex differences were observed in both behavior and microbiome; further analyses were conducted within sex using the pre-established goal/sign-tracking (GT/ST) phenotype and partial least squares differential analysis (PLS-DA) clustered behavioral phenotype.
RESULTS: Overall microbiome composition was not associated to the GT/ST phenotype. However, microbial alpha diversity was significantly decreased in female STs. On the other hand, a measure of impulsivity had many significant correlations to microbiome in both males and females. Several measures of impulsivity were correlated with the genus Barnesiella in females. Female STs had notable correlations between microbiome and attentional deficient. In both males and females, many measures were correlated with the bacterial families Ruminocococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate correlations between several addiction-related behaviors and the microbiome specific to sex.},

In this review, we critically discuss the present status of the gut microbiome in the Indian population and its difference from other populations.

This can be performed within one liquid chromatography (LC)-MS2 experiment or at the repository scale. GNPS-MassIVE is a public data repository for untargeted MS2 data with sample information (metadata) and annotated MS2 spectra. These publicly accessible data can be annotated and updated with the GNPS infrastructure keeping a continuous record of all changes. This knowledge is disseminated across all public data; it is a living dataset. Molecular networking—one of the main analysis tools used within the GNPS platform—creates a structured data table that reflects the molecular diversity captured in tandem mass spectrometry experiments by computing the relationships of the MS2 spectra as spectral similarity. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for creating reproducible, high-quality molecular networks. For training purposes, the reader is led through a 90- to 120-min procedure that starts by recalling an example public dataset and its sample information and proceeds to creating and interpreting a molecular network. Each data analysis job can be shared or cloned to disseminate the knowledge gained, thus propagating information that can lead to the discovery of molecules, metabolic pathways, and ecosystem/community interactions.},

 abstract = {Early puberty is a risk factor for adult diseases and biomedical and psychosocial research implicate growth (in height and weight) and stress as modifiable drivers of early puberty. Seldom have studies examined these drivers simultaneously or concurrently using quantitative and qualitative methods. Within the context of migration, we used mixed-methods to compare growth, stress and puberty in a study of 488 girls, aged 5-16, who were either Bangladeshi, first-generation migrant to the UK, second-generation migrant, or white British (conducted between 2009 and 2011). Using a biocultural framework, we asked the questions: 1) Does migration accelerate pubertal processes? 2) What biocultural markers are associated with migration? 3) What biocultural markers are associated with puberty? Girls self-reported pubertal stage, recalled 24-h dietary intake, and answered questions relating to dress, food, and ethnic identity. We collected anthropometrics and assayed saliva specimens for dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) to assess adrenarcheal status. Our findings demonstrate that first-generation migrants had earlier puberty than second-generation migrants and Bangladeshi girls. British style of dress did not increase with migration, while dietary choices did, which were reflected in increasing body mass index. However, the widely-used phrase, "I'm proud of my religion, but not my culture" demonstrated that ethnic identity was aligned more with Islamic religion than 'Bangladeshi culture.' This was epitomized by wearing the hijab, but denial of eating rice. The social correlates of puberty, such as 'practicing' wearing the hijab and becoming 'dedicated to the scarf,' occurred at the same ages as adrenarche and menarche, respectively, among first-generation girls. We suggest that the rejection of 'Bangladeshi culture' might be a source of psychosocial stress for first-generation girls, and this may explain elevated DHEA-S levels and early puberty compared to their second-generation counterparts. Our results support a biocultural model of adolescence, a period for biological embedding of culture, when biological and psychosocial factors adjust developmental timing with potential positive and negative implications for long-term health.},

                  Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are powerful modulators of microbiota composition and function. These substrates are often derived from diet, such as complex polysaccharides from plants or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) during breastfeeding. Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins may serve as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate the potential role of purified, orally-administered mucus glycans in maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified
                  O
                  -linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, suppress
                  C. difficile
                  abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced obesity, and increase relative abundance of resident
                  Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico
                  analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during host development and throughout evolution of the host-microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.

                    Background and objectives
                    Kin-selected altruism is an evolutionary explanation for why biological kin other than parents are willing childcare providers or alloparents. Kin alloparents may increase lineage fitness by reducing maternal energy depletion and improving child survival through childcare activities. The aim of this research was to apply the hypothesis that kin-based alloparental care has benefits for child health in a western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic context.
                  
                  
                    Methodology
                    The hypothesis was tested using the first sweep of the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18 552 infants). The outcome was number of hospitalizations by age 9 months, and the main predictors were kin-based alloparental care during work hours, socioeconomic position and infant health-related variables and their interactions with kin-based alloparenting. Analysis of hospitalizations was carried out using negative binomial regression.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Kin alloparents were primary day carers in 17% of households. Infants whose main care arrangement during work hours was with kin allocarers had statistically significantly fewer hospitalizations than infants in all other care arrangements combined (Incidence rate ratio = 0.86, P < 0.03), and when contrasted with maternal day care (Incidence rate ratio = 0.79, P < 0.02).
                  
                  
                    Conclusions and implications
                    Kin-based allocare was associated with about a 15% reduction in the risk of infant hospitalization in the first 9 months. The difference appeared to be due in part to a difference in the risk of hospitalization for infectious diseases. Sensitivity analyses indicated that infants cared for by their mother during the day rather than in day-care facilities were most at risk of hospitalization compared with those in kin-based care.
                  
                  
                    Lay summary
                    Modern industrialized societies are generally characterized by nuclear family households, with grandparents and other extended family often living a considerable distance away. Studies carried out in societies which have not undergone the fragmentation of extended families have shown that grandmothers and other biological kin reduce infant mortality, most likely because they distribute the burden of infant care so that it does not fall exclusively on the mother. Here, the hypothesis that grandparental and other family care would be beneficial for infant health in the contemporary UK was testing using the UK Millennium cohort. Infant health was measured as number of hospitalizations in the first 9 months from birth. The main findings were that kin-based infant care, which was most commonly by grandparents, was associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of hospitalization in infants up to 9 months of age. Further analysis suggested that the difference was larger for risk of infant hospitalization due to infectious diseases rather than non-infectious diseases. The results also suggested that the finding may have been driven by increased risk for infants of mothers caring for their infant during normal working hours with no other help, such as from the father or pay-for day-care.

                  The vaginal microbiota is presumably much simpler than the gut microbiome, and oral probiotics appear as a promising means to modulate its homeostasis in the general population. Here, 60 women were followed for over a year before, during and after a probiotic containing
                  Lactobacillus rhamnosus
                  GR-1 and
                  L. reuteri
                  RC-14. Shotgun metagenomic data of 1334 samples from multiple body sites did not support colonization of the probiotics to the vagino-cervical microbiome, yet the microbiome was stable in those dominated by Lactobacilli and some individuals have likely benefited from this medication-free intervention.

 abstract = {Studies in multiple host species have shown that gut microbial diversity and composition change during pregnancy and lactation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these shifts are not well understood. Here, we use longitudinal data from wild Phayre’s leaf monkeys to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in reproductive hormone concentrations contribute to gut microbial shifts during pregnancy. We described the microbial taxonomic composition of 91 fecal samples from 15 females (n = 16 cycling, n = 36 pregnant, n = 39 lactating) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and assessed whether the resulting data were better explained by overall reproductive stage or by fecal estrogen (fE) and progesterone (fP) concentrations. Our results indicate that while overall reproductive stage affected gut microbiome composition, the observed patterns were driven by reproductive hormones. Females had lower gut microbial diversity during pregnancy and fP concentrations were negatively correlated with diversity. Additionally, fP concentrations predicted both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances, while reproductive state only predicted unweighted UniFrac distances. Seasonality (rainfall and periods of phytoprogestin consumption) additionally influenced gut microbial diversity and composition. Our results indicate that reproductive hormones, specifically progestagens, contribute to the shifts in the gut microbiome during pregnancy and lactation.},

 abstract = {Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by exposure to dietary gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. In addition to the host genome, the microbiome has recently been linked to CeD risk and pathogenesis. To progress in our understanding of the role of breast milk microbiota profiles in CeD, we have analyzed samples from a sub-set of mothers (<i>n</i> = 49) included in the PreventCD project, whose children did or did not develop CeD. The results of the microbiota data analysis indicated that neither the BMI, HLA-DQ genotype, the CeD condition nor the gluten-free diet of the mothers could explain the human milk microbiota profiles. Nevertheless, we found that origin country, the offspring's birth date and, consequently, the milk sampling date influenced the abundance and prevalence of microbes in human milk, undergoing a transition from an anaerobic to a more aerobic microbiota, including potential pathogenic species. Furthermore, certain microbial species were more abundant in milk samples from mothers whose children went on to develop CeD compared to those that remained healthy. These included increases in facultative methylotrophs such as <i>Methylobacterium komagatae</i> and <i>Methylocapsa palsarum</i> as well as in species such as <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i>, that consumes fucosylated-oligosaccharides present in human milk, and other breast-abscess associated species. Theoretically, these microbiota components could be vertically transmitted from mothers-to-infants during breastfeeding, thereby influencing CeD risk.},

 abstract = {Microbiota of the wild blue sheep (<i>Pseudois nayaur</i>) presents a seasonal variation due to different dietary selection and feeding strategies from different ecological niches chosen by different sex in summer. To address those issues, we analyzed the variation of gut microbiota based on the material from the feces, with 16S rRNA and meta-genome aimed to explore seasonal and gender differences. The results indicate that seasonal dietary changes and gender differentiation, as expected, cause the variation in sheep's gut microbiota structure. The variation of the former is more significant than the latter. Dominant Firmicutes exists a significantly higher abundance in summer than that in winter. Subordinate Bacteroides expresses no seasonal difference between the two seasons. Compared with the winter group, the summer group is featured by abundant enzymes digesting cellulose and generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as beta-glucosidase (EC: 3.2.1.21) for cellulose digestion, and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7) in butyrate metabolism, implying that the changes of the composition in intestinal flora allow the sheep to adapt to the seasonalized dietary selection through alternated microbial functions to reach the goal of facilitating the efficiency of energy harvesting. The results also show that the blue sheep expresses a prominent sexual dimorphism in the components of gut microbiota, indicating that the two sexes have different adaptations to the dietary selection, and demands for physical and psychological purposes. Thus, this study provides an example of demonstrating the principles and regulations of natural selection and environmental adaptation.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe molecular clock is an important genetic tool for estimating evolutionary timescales. However, the detection of a time-dependent effect on substitution rate estimates complicates its application. It has been suggested that demographic processes could be the main cause of this confounding effect. In the present study, I propose a new algorithm for estimating the coalescent age of phylogenetically related sequences, taking into account the observed time-dependent effect on the molecular rate detected by others.ResultsBy applying this method to real human mitochondrial DNA trees with shallow and deep topologies, I obtained significantly older molecular ages for the main events of human evolution than were previously estimated. These ages are in close agreement with the most recent archaeological and paleontological records favoring the emergence of early anatomically modern humans in Africa 315 ± 34 thousand years ago (kya) and the presence of recent modern humans outside of Africa as early as 174 ± 48 thousand years ago. Furthermore, during the implementation process, I demonstrated that in a population with fluctuating sizes, the probability of fixation of a new neutral mutant depends on the effective population size, which is in better accordance with the fact that under the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the fate of a molecular mutation is mainly determined by random drift.ConclusionsI suggest that the demographic history of populations has a more decisive effect than purifying selection and/or mutational saturation on the time-dependent effect observed for the substitution rate, and I propose a new method that corrects for this effect.},

Prenatal vestibular-stimulation-as-dance (VES-D) was informed by Laban movement theories, modern dance technique, and pregnant hunter-gatherer’s activity patterns. Five pregnant women completed the VES-D program and participated in semi-structured interviews that explored their attitudes, expectations, and cultural beliefs before and during the dance program. Between nine and 11 days post-birth, the adult participants’ five newborn infants completed a home-based visual attention task that measured looking time and eye shifts using direct and averted gaze face stimuli. Adult participants reported the dance program was relaxing, enjoyable, and beneficial for both themselves and for their fetus. All infants showed habituation of the non-face stimulus and reorientation to the face stimulus for a mean time of 36 s, establishing looking time as a suitable outcome measure. Gaze preference based on infants’ pupil shifts was not determined to be a suitable outcome measure of attention. Administration of a home infant lab enhanced the ecological validity of the study design.},

 abstract = {Vitamin D is responsible for regulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism and maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. It is also known as an immunomodulatory hormone. Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, exerts immunologic activities on multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as endothelial membrane stability. Association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, respiratory infection, and COVID-19, has been observed. Accordingly, a number of clinical trials aiming to determine the efficacy of administration of vitamin D and its metabolites for treatment of these diseases have been conducted with variable outcomes. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D more or less than others as high inter-individual difference in broad gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to vitamin D supplementation has been observed. Although it is still debatable what level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is optimal, it is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and preferably at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve the optimal overall health benefits of vitamin D.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) is a highly social primate that lives in complex multilevel societies exhibiting a wide range of group behaviors akin to humans. In contrast to the widely studied human microbiome, there is a paucity of information on the host-associated microbiomes of nonhuman primates (NHPs). Here, our goal was to understand the microbial composition throughout different body sites of cohabiting baboons.ResultsWe analyzed 170 oral, oropharyngeal, cervical, uterine, vaginal, nasal and rectal samples from 16 hamadryas baboons via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, raw Miseq sequencing data from 1041 comparable publicly available samples from the human oral cavity, gut and vagina were reanalyzed using the same pipeline. We compared the baboon and human microbiome of the oral cavity, gut and vagina, showing that the baboon microbiome is distinct from the human. Baboon cohabitants share similar microbial profiles in their cervix, uterus, vagina, and gut. The oral cavity, gut and vagina shared more bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in group living baboons than in humans. The shared ASVs had significantly positive correlations between most body sites, suggesting a potential bacterial exchange throughout the body. No significant differences in gut microbiome composition were detected within the maternity line and between maternity lines, suggesting that the offspring gut microbiota is shaped primarily through bacterial exchange among cohabitants. Finally, Lactobacillus was not so predominant in baboon vagina as in the human vagina but was the most abundant genus in the baboon gut.ConclusionsThis study is the first to provide comprehensive analyses of the baboon microbiota across different body sites. We contrast this to human body sites and find substantially different microbiomes. This group of cohabitating baboons generally showed higher microbial diversity and remarkable similarities between body sites than were observed in humans. These data and findings from one group of baboons can form the basis of future microbiome studies in baboons and be used as a reference in research where the microbiome is expected to impact human modeling with baboons.},

Here, we characterize microbial community assembly in 47 infant-mother pairs from six Tsimane villages, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of longitudinal stool and tongue swab samples. We find that infant consumption of dairy products, vegetables, and chicha (a fermented drink inoculated with oral microbes) is associated with stool microbiota composition. In stool and tongue samples, microbes shared between mothers and infants are more abundant than non-shared microbes. Using a neutral model of community assembly, we find that neutral processes alone explain the prevalence of 79% of infant-colonizing microbes, but explain microbial prevalence less well in adults from river villages with more regular access to markets. Our results underscore the importance of neutral forces during microbiota assembly. Changing lifestyle factors may alter traditional modes of microbiota assembly by decreasing the role of neutral processes.},

Children waste large quantities of food and more research is required to better understand this problem and consequently to reduce food waste in the youngest generation. Here, we examined affective and behavioral components of attitudes towards food-wasting in a group of 670 children and 123 adults, aged 3–28. The participants viewed food wasting and food saving in a video, and we tested whether age affected the moral-emotional and behavioral reactions to a food wasting vs. food saving person. The attitude towards the food wasting protagonist (operationalized as “liking” indicated on a pictorial scale) was significantly more negative than that towards the food saving protagonist in all age groups except for the three- to five-year old children. Behavioral attitude towards the video protagonists was defined as a willingness to share some goods with a food wasting vs. a food saving person, and in our study, food wasting protagonist received equal amount or less resources distributed by the participants. Additionally, our data suggest that food wasting preferentially affected food sharing in adults, but not in children, as food was shared with the food wasting protagonist in significantly smaller quantities than pens by the oldest age group. In , we show that even preschoolers disapprove of food wasting behavior, but only in 6–7 year old children this attitude begins to become well established; it consolidates at the age of 8–9 and starts to include a behavioral component at the age of 10–12. We suggest that pro-environmental interventions targeting food waste reduction in children should start at middle childhood and focus on behavior.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Early childhood interventions primarily focus on the mother-child relationship, but grandmothers are often critical in childcare in low-resource settings. Prior research is mixed on how grandmother involvement influences child outcomes and there is a paucity of research on grandmother caregiving in low-income and middle-income countries. We examined the role of grandmother involvement on child growth and development in the first 2 years of life cross sectionally and longitudinally in rural Pakistan.
METHODS: We used data from the Bachpan Cohort, a longitudinal birth cohort in rural Pakistan. Maternally reported grandmother involvement in daily instrumental and non-instrumental caregiving was collected at 3 and 12 months. A summed score was created and categorised into non-involved, low and high. Outcomes included 12-month and 24-month child growth, 12-month Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and 24-month Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Socioemotional. We used multivariable generalised linear models to estimate mean differences (MD) at 12 months (n=727) and 24 months (n=712). Inverse probability weighting was used to account for missingness and sampling.
RESULTS: In our sample, 68% of children lived with a grandmother, and most grandmothers were involved in caregiving. Greater 3-month grandmother involvement was positively associated with 12-month weight z-scores; however, greater involvement was associated with lower 24-month weight z-scores. High 12-month grandmother involvement was associated with improved 12-month cognitive (MD=0.38, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.76), fine motor skills (MD=0.45, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83) and 24-month socioemotional development (MD=-17.83, 95% CI -31.47 to -4.19). No meaningful associations were found for length z-scores or language development.
CONCLUSION: In rural Pakistan, grandmothers provide caregiving that influences early child development. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between grandmother involvement and child weight, and suggest that grandmothers may positively promote early child cognitive, fine motor and socioemotional development. Understanding how grandmother involvement affects child outcomes in early life is necessary to inform caregiving interventions.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Background We compare life histories and selection forces among chimpanzees and human subsistence societies in order to identify the age-specific vital rates that best explain fitness variation, selection pressures and species divergence.   Methods We employ Life Table Response Experiments that quantify vital rate contributions to population growth rate differences. Although widespread in ecology, these methods have not been applied to human populations or to look at species differences among humans and chimpanzees. We also estimate correlations between vital rate elasticities and life history traits to investigate differences in selection pressures and test predictions of life history theory.   Results Chimpanzees’ earlier maturity and higher adult mortality drive species differences, whereas infant mortality and fertility variation drive differences among humans. Human fitness is decoupled from longevity by postreproductive survival, while chimpanzees forfeit higher potential lifetime fertility due to adult mortality attrition. Infant survival is often lower among humans, but lost fitness is recouped via short birth spacing and high peak fertility, thereby reducing selection on infant survival. Lastly, longevity and delayed maturity reduce selection on child survival, but among humans, recruitment selection is unexpectedly highest in longer-lived populations, which are also faster-growing due to high fertility.   Conclusion Humans differ from chimpanzees more because of delayed maturity and adult mortality than child mortality or fertility rates. In both species, high child mortality reflects bet-hedging costs of quality/quantity tradeoffs borne by offspring, with high and variable child mortality likely regulating human population growth over evolutionary history. Among human subsistence societies, positive correlations between survival and natural fertility lead selection pressures in human subsistence societies to differ from modern populations undergoing demographic transition, due in part to positive correlations between longevity and natural fertility and negative correlations between recruitment elasticity and reproductive effort. },

HQT contains abundant flavonoids, which display potent anticancer effects, but no research studies have investigated the cancer-preventive effects of HQT on CRC in vivo. Here, we found that HQT inhibits azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in a preneoplastic colonic ACF rat model. The essential role of the gut microbiota in the chemopreventive effect of HQT on CRC in a pseudo-germ-free rat model was confirmed. Besides, HQT modulates inflammatory cytokine expression by significantly decreasing IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α expression, and elevating IFN-γ production. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that HQT regulated the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Lachnoclostridium, Alistipes, Roseburia, and Lactococcus) and reducing the levels of Bacteroides, Parasutterella, and unidentified_Clostridiales. Fecal metabolomics showed that HQT modulated the AOM-induced metabolomic disorder, and these altered metabolites were almost involved in the lipid metabolic pathways. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. Collectively, these results suggested that HQT exerted beneficial effects on host health by inhibiting inflammation, and by regulating the gut microbiota profile and certain metabolic pathways. In conclusion, HQT inhibits AOM-induced ACF formation by modulating the gut microbiota composition and improving metabolomic disorders, indicating the potential of HQT as a functional beverage candidate for the prevention and treatment of CRC.},

 abstract = {Anthropologists and archaeologists have claimed that climate change can promote the occurrence of warfare because of competition over scarce resources. This chapter aims to illustrate a counterexample to this claim using a case-study of prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Jōmon period of Japan (13,000 cal BC–800 cal BC). We demonstrate the effects of climate change on ecological and sociocultural aspects of Jōmon society. The most notable consequence is population decline and the collapse of large settlements at the end of the Middle Jōmon sub-period. Based on the bioarchaeological data, we show that mortality attributable to violence remained at a low level throughout the Jōmon period and did not change in association with climate change, implying that climate change did not lead to an increase in violent behavior. Finally, we explore various non-violent strategies of Jōmon society for responding to harsh environments. Our results suggest that human societies can have a variety of buffers, including violent and non-violent ways, to react to environmental changes and thus the consequence of human-environment interactions can be diverse depending on their socio-cultural backgrounds.},

 abstract = {Diet plays an important role in shaping gut microbiota. However, much remains to be learned regarding this association. We analyzed dietary intake and gut microbiota in a community-dwelling cohort of 441 Colombians. Diet quality, intake of food groups and nutrient consumption were paired with microbial diversity and composition using linear regressions, Procrustes analyses and a random-forest machine-learning algorithm. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, including the five cities from where the participants originated, sex (male, female), age group (18-40 and 41-62 years), BMI (lean, overweight, obese) and socioeconomic status. Microbial diversity was higher in individuals with increased intake of nutrients obtained from plant-food sources, whereas the intake of food groups and nutrients correlated with microbiota structure. Random-forest regressions identified microbial communities associated with different diet components. Two remarkable results confirmed previous expectations regarding the link between diet and microbiota: communities composed of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers were more prevalent in the microbiota of individuals consuming diets rich in fiber and plant-food sources, such as fruits, vegetables and beans. In contrast, an inflammatory microbiota composed of bile-tolerant and putrefactive microorganisms along with opportunistic pathogens thrived in individuals consuming diets enriched in animal-food sources and of low quality, i.e., enriched in ultraprocessed foods and depleted in dietary fiber. This study expands our understanding of the relationship between dietary intake and gut microbiota. We provide evidence that diet is strongly associated with the gut microbial community and highlight generalizable connections between them.},

 abstract = {All results in this paper are based upon a new dataset consisting in 60 Swadesh lists of 207 items, overall 12,420 terms collected during 2018-2019. Each list corresponds to a different variety of Malagasy, which is not simply identified by the name of the ethnicity but also by the precise location where the variety was collected. This is very important since some traditional ethnic groups are a heritage of historical events rather than representing communities with similar habits and dialects. This new dataset is by far the best available, both for dimension and completeness. The varieties are classified both by standard tools, as the trees generated by UPGMA and NJ which privilege genealogy by detecting vertical transmissions, and by a new method which privileges horizontal exchanges. The new method results in a two-dimensional chart of Madagascar which realistically reproduces geography despite being generated only by comparison of words. The landing date of the ancestors of Malagasy is determined about 650 CE. This result is obtained by a straightforward approach based on the comparison of the UPGMA Malagasy family tree with the analogous tree of Romance family of languages for which all dates are well historically attested. We also propose an improved definition of Diversity computed for every locus in Madagascar and not only in places where the dialects were collected. Moreover, Diversity becomes a locally determined quantity as it is usually in biology. Diversity differences point to the South-East coast as the location where the first colonizers landed or, at least, where Malagasy variants started their dispersion. Finally, we find that the dialect spoken by the Mikea, a hunter-gatherer people in the South-West of Madagascar, is not very different from the variants of their neighbours Vezo and Masikoro. Therefore, Mikea unlikely can be linked to eventual aboriginal populations living in Madagascar prior to the main colonization event in 650 CE.},

It offers a broad range of economic benefits, including clothing and medicines, protection (shade), non-wood-forestry products and raw materials for several products. Milk, flavoring agents, spices, protein, oils, and feeds can be sourced from the fruits, the seeds, the leaves, and the flowers. Presently, there are several medicinal benefits of African Baobab. The roots, bark, and leave extracts (methanolic extracts) have high antiviral and antimicrobial activities. The bark contains alkaloid “Adansonin” studied to be active against malaria and fever. The fruit pulp is used as a functional food for natural treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemia associated health anomalies, through enhancing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. Notwithstanding this wealth of benefits, death of the tree has taken place in some part of the world, hence, imperative means of management and prevention must be enforced. Thus, this review tends to highlight the varied economical, medicinal, nutritional and anti-nutritional properties of African Baobab, and notably, its environmental sustainability.},

 abstract = { Predation risk affects a broad range of bird behaviours, especially parental care. The adaptive behavioural changes presented by both parents, however, may differ according to different levels of predation risk suffered by each sex. This is especially prominent in sexually dichromatic species, where one of the sexes is more visually conspicuous and hence vulnerable to increased nest predation risk during nest visits. Here, we experimentally investigated how predation risk affects the parental behaviour of a sexually dichromatic Neotropical passerine, the blue‐black grassquit Volatinia jacarina . We used playbacks of known predators and non‐predatorial control sympatric species near nesting pairs in the field. Results show that grassquits modify their behaviour according to predation risk and that this behavioural response is sex‐dependent. Males decrease their nest visit times, become more discreet when moving towards the nest, and stop performing sexual displays after leaving the nest. In contrast, females tend to decrease latency to visit the nest and increase the duration of brooding bouts. These different sex responses reduce nest visual and acoustic detectability, since conspicuous males are readily spotted on nests and cryptic females camouflage nestlings and suppress begging calls. Although these behavioural changes might reduce predation risk, there might be a cost of reduced food load to nestlings and increased brood starvation risk. These changes in nesting activities illustrate the behavioural adaptability of passerines to ensure offspring survival in tropical high predation risk environments. },

 abstract = {Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are powerful modulators of microbiota composition and function. These substrates are often derived from diet, such as complex polysaccharides from plants or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) during breastfeeding. Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during host development and throughout the evolution of the host-microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.},

 abstract = {AIM: To find thresholds at which laypersons and dental professionals perceive abnormalities in two facial frontal esthetics variables: facial symmetry and vertical harmony.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A baseline frontal image of a young male face with optimum facial proportions was generated from a real image using a photo editing software. Different facial asymmetry images were then generated from this image by manipulating the chin point position at 2 mm increment to the left side. Vertical harmony was perceived through manipulating lower anterior facial height (LAFH) at a ratio of 2% of increased and decreased heights. A total of 120 raters divided equally into four groups of laypersons, general dental practitioners (GDPs), orthodontists, and oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFSs) rated these images using an analog scale of 100 mm long. Using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests at <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, the image that showed the first statistical difference compared to the baseline was considered as a threshold of abnormality.
RESULTS: The image of 4 mm asymmetry was defined by the laypersons and GDPs as the threshold of abnormality, while the orthodontists and OMFSs realized that at 2 mm. Laypersons and GDPs defined a threshold of 46% as an abnormal decrease in the LAFH and the other 2 groups at 48%. All dental professionals groups rated the image of 54% as an abnormal increase in the LAFH while laypersons perceived that at 56%.
CONCLUSION: These thresholds regarding frontal esthetics may contribute to the process of establishing proper orthodontic treatment planning that suits the highest facial esthetic standards.},

 abstract = {BackgroundComparisons of traditional hunter-gatherers and pre-agricultural communities in Africa with urban and suburban Western North American and European cohorts have clearly shown that diet, lifestyle and environment are associated with gut microbiome composition. Yet, little is known about the gut microbiome composition of most communities in the very diverse African continent. South Africa comprises a richly diverse ethnolinguistic population that is experiencing an ongoing epidemiological transition and concurrent spike in the prevalence of obesity, largely attributed to a shift towards more Westernized diets and increasingly inactive lifestyle practices. To characterize the microbiome of African adults living in more mainstream lifestyle settings and investigate associations between the microbiome and obesity, we conducted a pilot study, designed collaboratively with community leaders, in two South African cohorts representative of urban and transitioning rural populations. As the rate of overweight and obesity is particularly high in women, we collected single time-point stool samples from 170 HIV-negative women (51 at Soweto; 119 at Bushbuckridge), performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on these samples and compared the data to concurrently collected anthropometric data.ResultsWe found the overall gut microbiome of our cohorts to be reflective of their ongoing epidemiological transition. Specifically, we find that geographical location was more important for sample clustering than lean/obese status and observed a relatively higher abundance of the Melainabacteria, Vampirovibrio, a predatory bacterium, in Bushbuckridge. Also, Prevotella, despite its generally high prevalence in the cohorts, showed an association with obesity. In comparisons with benchmarked datasets representative of non-Western populations, relatively higher abundance values were observed in our dataset for Barnesiella (log2fold change (FC) = 4.5), Alistipes (log2FC = 3.9), Bacteroides (log2FC = 4.2), Parabacteroides (log2FC = 3.1) and Treponema (log2FC = 1.6), with the exception of Prevotella (log2FC = − 4.7).ConclusionsAltogether, this work identifies putative microbial features associated with host health in a historically understudied community undergoing an epidemiological transition. Furthermore, we note the crucial role of community engagement to the success of a study in an African setting, the importance of more population-specific studies to inform targeted interventions as well as present a basic foundation for future research.},

The influence of rearing conditions on the infant's gut microbiota and its relationship with developmental health has become more evident. The microbiome is essential for normal growth and metabolism, and the signaling from the gut to the brain may underlie individual differences in resilience later in life. Microbial diversity and composition were determined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples from 17 adolescents adopted internationally from orphanages into the United States and 18 adolescents reared in birth families who had similar educational and income levels. Analyses focused on diversity of the microbial community structure and differences in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Blood samples were used to immunophenotype the numbers of several T-cell subsets and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed several operational taxonomic units that were significantly different based on early rearing conditions and CMV seropositivity. There were significant associations between the relative abundance of certain taxa, the percentages of T-cell subsets in circulation, and CMV seropositivity. These findings demonstrate a possible link between the gut microbiota and associations with immune alterations initiated by early life adversity.},

This could imply that prehistoric hunter-gatherers were demographically different from recent hunter-gatherers. However, we show that the resolution of archaeological human population proxies is not sufficiently high to detect actual population dynamics and growth rates that can be observed in the historical and ethnographic data. We argue that archaeological and ethnographic population growth rates measure different things; therefore, they are not directly comparable. While ethnographic growth rate estimates of hunter-gatherer populations are directly linked to underlying demographic parameters, archaeological estimates track changes in the long-term mean population size, which reflects changes in the environmental productivity that provide the ultimate constraint for forager population growth. We further argue that because of this constraining effect, hunter-gatherer populations cannot exhibit long-term growth independently of increasing environmental productivity.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in host physiology, metabolism, immunity, and behavior. And host genetics could influence the gut microbiota of hybrid animals. The three-way cross model is commonly utilized in commercial pig production; however, the use of this model to analyse the gut microbial composition is rarely reported.
METHODS: Two three-way hybrid pigs were selected, with Saba pigs as the starting maternal pig: Duroc× (Berkshire×Saba) (DBS) pig, Berkshire×(Duroc×Saba) (BDS) pig. One hundred pigs of each model were reared from 35 days (d) to 210 d. The body weight or feed consumption of all pigs were recorded and their feed/gain (F/G) ratio was calculated. On day 210, 10 pigs from each three-way cross were selected for slaughter, and cecal chyme samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: The final body weight (FBW) and average daily gain (ADG) of DBS pigs were significantly higher than those of BDS pigs (p<0.05), while the F/G ratios of DBS pigs were significantly lower than those of BDS pigs (p<0.05). The dominant phyla in DBS and BDS pigs were Bacteroidetes (55.23% vs 59%, respectively) and Firmicutes (36.65% vs 34.86%, respectively) (p>0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Prevotella, Roseburia, and Anaerovibrio in DBS pigs was significantly lower than in BDS pigs (p<0.01). The abundance of Eubacterium, Clostridium XI, Bacteroides, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Parabacteroides in DBS pigs was significantly higher than in BDS pigs (p<0.05). The FBWs and ADGs were positively correlated with Bacteroides, ClostridiumXI, and Parabacteroides but negatively correlated with the Prevotella, Prevotella/Bacteroides (P/B) ratio, Roseburia, and Anaerovibrio.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that host genetics affect the cecal microbiota composition and the porcine gut microbiota is associated with growth performance, thereby suggesting that gut microbiota composition may be a useful biomarker in porcine genetics and breeding.},

 abstract = {Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The disease and its treatments exert profound effects on an individual's physical and mental health. There are many factors that impact an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, their response to treatments, and their risk of recurrence. The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiota, affects human health through metabolic, neural, and endocrine signaling, and immune activity. It is through these mechanisms that the gut microbiota appears to influence breast cancer risk, response to treatment, and recurrence. A disrupted gut microbiota or state of 'dysbiosis' can contribute to a biological environment associated with higher risk for cancer development as well as contribute to negative treatment side-effects. Many cancer treatments have been shown to shift the gut microbiota toward dysbiosis; however, the microbiota can also be positively manipulated through diet, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation, and exercise. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and breast cancer and to highlight potential strategies for modulation of the gut microbiota that could lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall health in this population.},

                  Background
                  The maternal microbiome has emerged as an important factor in gestational health and outcome and is associated with risk of preterm birth and offspring morbidity. Epidemiological evidence also points to successive pregnancies – referred to as maternal parity – as a risk factor for preterm birth, infant mortality, and impaired neonatal growth. Despite the fact that both the maternal microbiome and parity are linked to maternal-infant health, the impact of parity on the microbiome remains largely unexplored, in part due to the challenges of studying parity in humans.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    Using synchronized pregnancies and dense longitudinal monitoring of the microbiome in pigs, we describe a microbiome trajectory during pregnancy and determine the extent to which parity modulates this trajectory. We show that the microbiome changes reproducibly during gestation and that this remodeling occurs more rapidly as parity increases. At the time of parturition, parity was linked to the relative abundance of several bacterial species, including
                    Treponema bryantii, Lactobacillus amylovorus
                    , and
                    Lactobacillus reuteri
                    . Strain tracking carried out in 18 maternal-offspring ‘quadrads’ – each consisting of one mother sow and three piglets – linked maternal parity to altered levels of
                    Akkermansia muciniphila, Prevotella stercorea
                    , and
                    Campylobacter coli
                    in the infant gut 10 days after birth.
                  
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Collectively, these results identify parity as an important environmental factor that modulates the gut microbiome during pregnancy and highlight the utility of a swine model for investigating the microbiome in maternal-infant health. In addition, our data show that the impact of parity extends beyond the mother and is associated with alterations in the community of bacteria that colonize the offspring gut early in life. The bacterial species we identified as parity-associated in the mother and offspring have been shown to influence host metabolism in other systems, raising the possibility that such changes may influence host nutrient acquisition or utilization. These findings, taken together with our observation that even subtle differences in parity are associated with microbiome changes, underscore the importance of considering parity in the design and analysis of human microbiome studies during pregnancy and in infants.

However, a substantial amount of fundamental human milk microbiome information remains unclear, such as the origin, composition and function of the community and its members. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the diversity and composition of the milk microbiome might differ between lactation stages, due to maternal factors and diet, agrarian and urban lifestyles, and geographical location. The evolution of the methods used for studying milk microbiota, transitioning from culture dependent-approaches to include culture-independent approaches, has had an impact on findings and, in particular, primer selection within 16S rRNA gene barcoding studies have led to discrepancies in observed microbiota communities. Here, the current state-of-the-art is reviewed and emerging frontiers essential to improving our understanding of the human milk microbiome are considered.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Two human lateral mandibular incisors exhibiting exceptional dental wear in the form of lingual surface grooves along the cementoenamel junction were recovered from the superficial levels of a pit grave attributed to the Bronze Age at the archaeological site of Monte do Vale do Ouro 2 (Ferreira do Alentejo, Beja, Portugal). Although a number of analyses of dental wear features acknowledge the relatively common use of the dentition for nondietary purposes (using the ‘teeth as tools’) during the Early/Middle Bronze Age (2200–1200 BC) of southwest Iberia, the form of dental wear documented at Monte do Vale do Ouro 2 is not only a novel finding in this region but also has seldom been described in any bioarchaeological context. The present study provides a macroscopic and low‐magnification description of the atypical dental wear for this individual. Results indicate that the incisors are likely antimeres. In addition to the deep lingual grooves, asymmetrical wear removed a substantial portion of the laterolingual crown volume of each tooth. Occlusal and lingual surface wear accumulated slowly enough for tertiary dentin to form. An occlusal groove is also present on the right I 2 . A review of ethnohistoric and bioarchaeological literature suggests that some form of craft production involving the manipulation of cordage or fibre with the mouth and teeth can account for the unique wear patterns from Monte do Vale do Ouro 2. The hand‐spinning of flax requires wetting which can be accomplished by passing flax fibres through the mouth in a mediolateral direction while using a hand spindle. Similar habitual behaviours were probably practiced by the Bronze Age individual from Monte do Vale do Ouro 2. The wear grooves represent the embodiment of aspects of craft production and maintenance activities that occurred during this individual's lifecourse. },

 abstract = {BackgroundPopulation-based levels of the chronic low-grade systemic inflammation biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), vary widely among traditional populations, despite their apparent absence of chronic conditions associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. We have previously reported an apparent absence of aforementioned conditions amongst the traditional Melanesian horticulturalists of Kitava, Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea. Our objective in this study was to clarify associations between chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and chronic cardiometabolic conditions by measuring CRP in a Kitava population sample. For comparison purposes, CRP was also measured in Swedish controls matched for age and gender.
MethodsFasting levels of serum CRP were measured cross-sectionally in ≥ 40-year-old Kitavans (N = 79) and Swedish controls (N = 83).ResultsCRP was lower for Kitavans compared to Swedish controls (Mdn 0.5 mg/L range 0.1—48 mg/L and Mdn 1.1 mg/L range 0.1—33 mg/L, respectively, r = .18 p = .02). Among Kitavans, there were small negative associations between lnCRP for CRP values < 10 and total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol. Among Swedish controls, associations of lnCRP for CRP values < 10 were medium positive with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-hip ratio and low positive with triglyceride, total cholesterol-HDL cholesterol ratio, triglyceride-HDL cholesterol ratio and serum insulin.ConclusionsChronic low-grade systemic inflammation, measured as CRP, was lower among Kitavans compared to Swedish controls, indicating a lower and average cardiovascular risk, respectively, for these populations.},

 abstract = {Compared with urban-industrial populations, small-scale human communities worldwide share a significant number of gut microbiome traits with nonhuman primates. This overlap is thought to be driven by analogous dietary triggers; however, the ecological and functional bases of this similarity are not fully understood. To start addressing this issue, fecal metagenomes of BaAka hunter-gatherers and traditional Bantu agriculturalists from the Central African Republic were profiled and compared with those of a sympatric western lowland gorilla group (<i>Gorilla</i> <i>gorilla gorilla</i>) across two seasons of variable dietary intake. Results show that gorilla gut microbiomes shared similar functional traits with each human group, depending on seasonal dietary behavior. Specifically, parallel microbiome traits were observed between hunter-gatherers and gorillas when the latter consumed more structural polysaccharides during dry seasons, while small-scale agriculturalist and gorilla microbiomes showed significant functional overlap when gorillas consumed more seasonal ripe fruit during wet seasons. Notably, dominance of microbial transporters, transduction systems, and gut xenobiotic metabolism was observed in association with traditional agriculture and energy-dense diets in gorillas at the expense of a functional microbiome repertoire capable of metabolizing more complex polysaccharides. Differential abundance of bacterial taxa that typically distinguish traditional from industrialized human populations (e.g., <i>Prevotella</i> spp.) was also recapitulated in the human and gorilla groups studied, possibly reflecting the degree of polysaccharide complexity included in each group's dietary niche. These results show conserved functional gut microbiome adaptations to analogous diets in small-scale human populations and nonhuman primates, highlighting the role of plant dietary polysaccharides and diverse environmental exposures in this convergence.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The results of this study highlight parallel gut microbiome traits in human and nonhuman primates, depending on subsistence strategy. Although these similarities have been reported before, the functional and ecological bases of this convergence are not fully understood. Here, we show that this parallelism is, in part, likely modulated by the complexity of plant carbohydrates consumed and by exposures to diverse xenobiotics of natural and artificial origin. Furthermore, we discuss how divergence from these parallel microbiome traits is typically associated with adverse health outcomes in human populations living under culturally westernized subsistence patterns. This is important information as we trace the specific dietary and environmental triggers associated with the loss and gain of microbial functions as humans adapt to various dietary niches.},

 abstract = {The previous studies have reported that the mammalian gut microbiota is a physiological consequence; nonetheless, the factors influencing its composition and function remain unclear. In this study, to evaluate the contributions of the host and environment to the gut microbiota, we conducted a sequencing analysis of 16S rDNA and shotgun metagenomic DNA from plateau pikas and yaks, two sympatric herbivorous mammals, and further compared the sequences in summer and winter. The results revealed that both pikas and yaks harboured considerably more distinct communities between summer and winter. We detected the over-representation of Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria in pikas, and Archaea and Bacteroidetes in yaks. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, associated with energy-efficient acquisition, significantly enriched in winter. The diversity of the microbial community was determined by the interactive effects between the host and season. Metagenomic analysis revealed that methane-metabolism-related pathway of yaks was significantly enriched in summer, while some pathogenic pathways were more abundant in pikas. Both pikas and yaks had a higher capacity for lipid degradation in winter. Pika and yak shared more OTUs when food shortage occurred in winter, and this caused a convergence in gut microbial composition and function. From winter to summer, the network module number increased from one to five in pikas, which was different in yaks. Our study demonstrates that the host is a dominant factor in shaping the microbial communities and that seasonality promotes divergence or convergence based on dietary quality across host species identity.},

Changes in the gut microbiome may lead to varying nutrient utilizing efficiency in pregnant and lactating female primates. In this study, we examined variation in the gut bacterial community composition of wild female Tibetan macaques (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) across different reproductive states (cycling, pregnancy and lactation). Fecal samples (n = 25) were collected from ten adult females harvested across different reproductive states. Gut microbial community composition and potential functions were assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequences. We found significant changes in gut bacterial taxonomic composition, structure and their potential functions in different reproductive states of our study species. In particular, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased significantly during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, the relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and <i>Succinivibrio</i> (Succinivibrionaceae) were overrepresented in pregnant females, whereas Bifidobacteriaceae and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (Bifidobacteriaceae) were overrepresented in lactating females. Furthermore, the relative abundance of predicted functional genes of several metabolic pathways related to host's energy and nutrition, such as metabolism of carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamins, glycans and other amino acids, were enriched in pregnancy and lactation. Our findings suggest that changes in the gut microbiome may play an important role in meeting the energetic needs of pregnant and lactating Tibetan macaques.

Lak phages were detected in 13 different animal types and are particularly prevalent in pigs, with significant enrichment in the hindgut compared to foregut. We reconstructed 34 new Lak genomes, including six curated complete genomes, all of which are alternatively coded. The most deeply branched Lak is from a horse faecal sample and is the largest phage genome from an animal microbiome (~660 kbp). From the Lak genomes, we identified families of hypothetical proteins associated with specific animal types. Overall, we substantially expanded Lak phage diversity and demonstrate their occurrence in a variety of human and animal microbiomes.

We observe significantly higher genus-level resilience in non-industrial populations, while SCFA production in industrial populations is driven by a few phylogenetically closely related species (belonging to Bacteroides and Clostridium), meaning industrial microbiomes have low resilience potential. Additionally, database bias obfuscates resilience estimates, as we were 2–5 times more likely to identify SCFA-encoding species in industrial microbiomes compared to non-industrial. Overall, we find high phylogenetic diversity, richness, and evenness of bacteria encoding SCFAs in non-industrial gut microbiomes, signaling high potential for resilience in SCFA production, despite database biases that limit metagenomic analysis of non-industrial populations.},

Characterizing the interactions between the human intestinal microbiome and helminths is of interest in the development of alternative treatments that do not rely on chemotherapeutics and do not lead to drug resistance.MethodsWe recruited and obtained fecal samples from 32 pairs of mothers and children on Pemba Island and monitored their intestinal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.ResultsWe observed that microbial changes occur in the gut microbiota of infected mothers and children. Some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and carbohydrate-degrading bacteria exhibited lower abundance in the infected individuals. Potentially pathogenic Campylobacter and proinflammatory Methanobrevibacter in infected mothers and opportunistic Enterococcus in infected children exhibited greater abundance.ConclusionsOur findings could reveal the microbiota profiling in T. trichiura-infected individuals, indicate the potential roles of key microbiota in the host and aid to the development of novel strategies to control T. trichiura infection.Graphical Abstract},

This evidence from bats provides profound insights into the potential influence of gut microbiota in COVID-19 disease in humans. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota helps bats tolerate deadly viruses, and summarize the current clinical evidence on the influence of gut microbiota on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of COVID-19 leading to a fatal outcome.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota potentially plays an important role in the immunologic education of the host during early infancy.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine how the infant gut microbiota evolve during infancy, particularly in relation to hygiene-related environmental factors, atopic disorders, and a randomized introduction of allergenic solids.
METHODS: A total of 1303 exclusively breast-fed infants were enrolled in a dietary randomized controlled trial (Enquiring About Tolerance study) from 3 months of age. In this nested longitudinal study, fecal samples were collected at baseline, with additional sampling of selected cases and controls at 6 and 12 months to study the evolution of their gut microbiota, using 16S ribosomal RNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS: In the 288 baseline samples from exclusively breast-fed infant at 3 months, the gut microbiota was highly heterogeneous, forming 3 distinct clusters: Bifidobacterium-rich, Bacteroides-rich, and Escherichia/Shigella-rich. Mode of delivery was the major discriminating factor. Increased Clostridium sensu stricto relative abundance at 3 months was associated with presence of atopic dermatitis on examination at age 3 and 12 months. From the selected cases and controls with longitudinal samples (n = 70), transition to Bacteroides-rich communities and influx of adult-specific microbes were observed during the first year of life. The introduction of allergenic solids promoted a significant increase in Shannon diversity and representation of specific microbes, such as genera belonging to Prevotellaceae and Proteobacteria (eg, Escherichia/Shigella), as compared with infants recommended to exclusively breast-feed.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific gut microbiota characteristics of samples from 3-month-old breast-fed infants were associated with cesarean birth, and greater Clostridium sensu stricto abundance was associated with atopic dermatitis. The randomized introduction of allergenic solids from age 3 months alongside breast-feeding was associated with differential dynamics of maturation of the gut microbial communities.},

 abstract = {Early life gut microbiota are affected by several factors that make identification of microbial-adiposity relationships challenging. This review evaluates studies that have investigated the gut microbiota composition associated with adiposity in infants, children, and adolescents and provides evidence-based nutrition recommendations that address microbiota-adiposity links. Electronic databases were systematically searched through January 2020. Eligible studies were published in English and analyzed gut microbiota and adiposity among individuals aged birth to 18 years. Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed by three independent reviewers. Of 45 full-text articles reviewed, 33 were included. No difference in abundance was found for Bacteroidetes (n = 7/15 articles), Firmicutes (n = 10/17), Actinobacteria (n = 8/12), Proteobacteria (n = 8/12), Tenericutes (n = 4/5), and Verrucomicrobia (n = 4/6) with adiposity. Lower abundance of Christensenellaceae (n = 3/5) and Rikenellaceae (n = 6/8) but higher abundance of F. prausnitzii (n = 3/5) and Prevotella (n = 5/7) were associated with adiposity. A lack of consensus exists for gut microbial composition associations with adiposity. A healthy gut microbiota is associated with a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with moderate consumption of animal fat and protein. Future research should use more robust sequencing technologies to identify all bacterial taxa associated with adiposity and evaluate how diet effects these adiposity-associated microbes.},

The aim is to advance awareness, research capacity and knowledge translation of science related to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) as a means of preventing NCDs in future generations. Application of DOHaD science is a promising avenue for prevention, as this field is identifying how health and nutrition from conception through the first 1 000 days of life can dramatically impact a developing individual’s future life course, and specifically predicate whether or not they are programmed in infancy to develop NCDs in later life. Prevention of NCDs is an essential strategy as, if unchecked, the burden of caring for a growing and ageing population with these diseases threatens to consume entire health budgets, as well as negatively impact the quality of life of millions. Africa in particular needs specific, focussed endeavors to realize the maximal preventive potential of DOHaD science, and a means of generating governmental and public awareness about the links between health in infancy and disease in adult life. This volume summarizes the expertise and experience of a leading group of international scientists led by Abdallah Daar brought together at STIAS as part of the ‘Health in Transition’ programme.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans life histories have been described as "slow", patterned by slow growth, delayed maturity, and long life span. While it is known that human life history diverged from that of a recent common chimpanzee-human ancestor some ~4-8 mya, it is unclear how selection pressures led to these distinct traits. To provide insight, we compare wild chimpanzees and human subsistence societies in order to identify the age-specific vital rates that best explain fitness variation, selection pressures and species divergence.
METHODS: We employ Life Table Response Experiments to quantify vital rate contributions to population growth rate differences. Although widespread in ecology, these methods have not been applied to human populations or to inform differences between humans and chimpanzees. We also estimate correlations between vital rate elasticities and life history traits to investigate differences in selection pressures and test several predictions based on life history theory.
RESULTS: Chimpanzees' earlier maturity and higher adult mortality drive species differences in population growth, whereas infant mortality and fertility variation explain differences between human populations. Human fitness is decoupled from longevity by postreproductive survival, while chimpanzees forfeit higher potential lifetime fertility due to adult mortality attrition. Infant survival is often lower among humans, but lost fitness is recouped via short birth spacing and high peak fertility, thereby reducing selection on infant survival. Lastly, longevity and delayed maturity reduce selection on child survival, but among humans, recruitment selection is unexpectedly highest in longer-lived populations, which are also faster-growing due to high fertility.
CONCLUSION: Humans differ from chimpanzees more because of delayed maturity and lower adult mortality than from differences in juvenile mortality or fertility. In both species, high child mortality reflects bet-hedging costs of quality/quantity tradeoffs borne by offspring, with high and variable child mortality likely regulating human population growth over evolutionary history. Positive correlations between survival and fertility among human subsistence populations leads to selection pressures in human subsistence societies that differ from those in modern populations undergoing demographic transition.},

 abstract = {Obesity rates are increasing worldwide, with an alarming number of associated co-morbidities and deaths. Evolutionary psychology explains this development with an inherent preference for fatty and sweet foods. Recent evidence shows that consumers with a low socioeconomic status are more prone to being obese, but also that consumers with few resources respond more to scarcity signals. Based on this background, this paper investigates whether overweight individuals with a low income respond more to scarcity signaling in terms of sales promotions than others. To this end, a large-scale online survey was conducted across four food product categories in the setting of an online supermarket. Results show that overweight or obese individuals with low income levels responded more strongly to scarcity signaling. The findings inform researchers in terms of explaining different responses to sales promotions and support practitioners in aligning sales promotions to target group-specific behavior.},

A 2019 individual participant data meta-analysis of 6 studies from high-income countries found that maternal supine going-to-sleep position increased the risk of stillbirth. It is not clear whether this impact would be the same in LMICs, and the normal sleep behaviour of pregnant women in LMICs is not well understood.ObjectiveDetermine the prevalence of different sleeping positions among pregnant women in LMICs, and what (if any) positions were associated with stillbirth using a systematic review.Search strategyWe systematically searched the databases Medline, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL and Global Index Medicus for relevant studies, with no date or language restrictions on 4 April 2020. Reference lists of included studies were also screened.Selection criteriaObservational studies of maternal sleep position during pregnancy in LMICsData collection and analysisRecovered citations were screened and eligible studies were included for extraction. These steps were performed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.Main resultsA total of 3480 citations were screened but only two studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in Ghana and India and reported on different maternal sleep positions: supine and left lateral. In Ghana, a prevalence of 9.7% for supine sleeping position amongst 220 women was found. The primary outcome could not be extracted from the Indian study as sleep position information was only reported for women who had a stillbirth (100 of the 300 participants).ConclusionThere is limited information on maternal sleeping position in LMICs. Since sleep position may be a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth, there is a need for further research to understand the sleep practices and behaviours of pregnant women in LMICs.PROSPERO registration: CRD42020173314},

 abstract = {Forensic medicine has, for a long time, been relying on biochemical, anthropologic, and histopathologic evidences in solving various investigations. However, depending on the method used, lengthy sample processing time, scanty sample, and less sensitivity and accuracy pervade these procedures. Accordingly, newer arenas such as the thanatomicrobiome have come forward to aid in its quandaries; furthermore, the parallel advances in genomic and proteomic techniques have complemented and are still emerging to be used in forensic experiments and investigations. Postmortem interval (PMI) is one of the most important aspects of medico-legal investigations. The current trend in PMI estimation is toward genomic analyses of autopsy samples. Similarly, determination of cause of death, although a domain of medical sciences, is being targeted as the next level of forensic casework. With the current trend in laboratory sciences moving to the discovery of newer disease-specific markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, the same is being explored for the determination of the cause of death by using techniques such as Real-Time PCR, DNA micro-array, to Next-Gen Sequencing. Establishing an individual’s biological profile has been done using medicolegal methods and anthropology as well as bar-bodies/Davidson bodies (gender determination); and in cases where the determination of age/gender is a challenge using morphological characteristics; the recent advances in the field of genomics and proteomics have played a significant role, e.g., use of mitochondrial DNA in age estimation and in maternity disputes. The major hurdle forensic medical research faces is the fact that most of the studies are conducted in animal models, which are often difficult to mimic in human and real-time scenarios. Additionally, the high accuracy required in criminal investigations to be used in a court of law as evidence has prevented these results to come out of the labs and be used to the optimum. The current review aims at giving a comprehensive and critical account of the various molecular biology techniques including “thanatogenomics,” currently being utilized in the veritable fields of forensic medicine.},

 abstract = {Vitamin D is known not only for its importance for bone health but also for its biologic activities on many other organ systems. This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells, and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a level of least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably 40 to 60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: A healthy gut microbiome is critical for glucose metabolism during pregnancy. In vivo studies indicate that trace element affects the composition and function of the gut microbiome and potentially leads to metabolic disorders but their relationships are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate whether the gut microbiome plays a role in the relationship between trace element exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, serum levels of 22 trace elements and the fecal gut microbiome composition were assessed in 837 pregnant women in the second trimester between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy prior to GDM diagnosis. Regression and mediation analysis were used to explore the link between element exposure, the gut microbiome, and GDM.
RESULTS: 128 pregnant women (15.3%) were diagnosed with GDM. No individual trace elements were found significantly associated with GDM. In contrast, the composition of the gut microbiome was dramatically altered in women later diagnosed with GDM and characterized by lower alpha diversity and lower abundance of co-abundance groups (CAGs) composed of genera belonging to Ruminococcaceae, Coriobacteriales, and Lachnospiraceae. Rubidium (Rb) was positively associated with alpha diversity indices while mercury (Hg) and vanadium (V) showed negative associations. Elements including rubidium (Rb), thallium (Tl), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb) were significantly correlated with GDM-related CAGs and mediation analysis revealed that Rb and Sb were inversely related to GDM risk by altering abundance levels of CAGs enriched for Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriales, and Ruminococcaceae.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that trace element exposure is associated with specific gut microbiome features that may contribute to GDM development, which could provide a new avenue for intervening in environmental exposure-related GDM.},

 abstract = {One of the distinctive features of the human taste system is that it categorizes food into a few taste qualities – e.g., sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. Here, I examined the functional significance of these taste qualities by asking what they tell us about the nutritional composition and toxicity of foods. I collected published data on the composition of raw and unprocessed foods – i.e., fruits, endosperm tissues, starchy foods, mushrooms, and meats. Sweet taste is thought to help identify foods with a high caloric or micronutrient density. However, the sweetest foods (fruits) had a relatively modest caloric density and low micronutrient density, whereas the blandest foods (endosperm tissues and meats) had a relatively high caloric and high micronutrient density. Salty taste is thought to be a proxy for foods high in sodium. Sodium levels were higher in meats than in most plant materials, but raw meats lack a salient salty taste. Sour taste (a measure of acidity) is thought to signify dangerous or spoiled foods. While this may be the case, it is notable that most ripe fruits are acidic. Umami taste is thought to reflect the protein content of food. I found that free L-glutamate (the prototypical umami tastant) concentration varies independently of protein content in foods. Bitter taste is thought to help identify poisonous foods, but many nutritious plant materials taste bitter. Fat taste is thought to help identify triglyceride-rich foods, but the role of taste versus mouthfeel in the attraction to fatty foods is unresolved. These findings indicate that the taste system provides incomplete or, in some cases, misleading information about the nutritional content and toxicity of foods. This may explain why inputs from the taste system are merged with inputs from the other cephalic senses and intestinal nutrient-sensing systems. By doing so, we create a more complete sensory representation and nutritional evaluation of foods.},

Evolutionary context is rarely considered in psychological infant sleep research, and Western sleep researchers make assumptions about what optimal "normal" infant sleep is and how to achieve early, deep, infant sleep consolidation and avoid infant sleep problems. However, an evolutionary and anthropological view of infant sleep as species-typical recognizes that human evolution likely prepared the infant brain for optimal development within its evolutionary context - co-sleeping. Thus, "normal" infant sleep, sleep consolidation, and sleep problems should all be understood within the framework of co-sleeping infants, not the historically new-phenomenon of solitary-sleeping infants.

Among the latter, the gut microbiota has emerged as a critical player in the regulation of human metabolism and health and the development of non-communicable chronic diseases. Considering that no information on this matter is available in Argentina, our aim was to identify the microorganisms associated with obesity as well as their potential functionality. Using high throughput sequencing of 16SrRNA bacterial gene and diverse bioinformatics tools, we observed that the gut microbiota of obese and overweight individuals differs qualitatively and quantitatively from that from their lean counterparts. The comparison of the gut microbiota composition in obese subjects from Argentina, US and UK showed that the beta diversity significantly differs among the three countries, indicating that obesity-associated microbiota composition changes according to the geographical origin of the individuals. Moreover, four distinct microbiotypes were identified in obese individuals, whose prevalence and metabolic pathway signature differed according to the country, indicating that obesity associated dysbiosis would comprise several structures. In summary, identification of distinct taxonomic signatures associated with obesity might be a novel promising tool to stratify patients based on their microbiome configuration to design strategies for managing obesity.},

The dft index was lower in the group that breastfed for less than 18 months (<i>p</i> = 0.02). In addition, there were significant differences in the dft index in the group breastfeeding for more than 18 months between those who coslept for 18 months or more and those who coslept for less than 18 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), as well as between those who coslept for 18 months or more and those who did not cosleep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, breastfeeding at night from 18 months onwards is considered a risk factor for ECC.},

 abstract = {  The discourse of Islamophobia in Europe has become increasingly popular after the endless war in the Middle East. The instability that hit the Middle East after Arab Spring and the civil war in Syria has forced some of its population to migrate to European countries, including France. The large number of immigrants who have entered France has also been accompanied by rampant acts of attacks and terrorism, thereby revives the feelings of Islamophobia among the native white French. Meanwhile, Front National as an ultranationalist party known for its racist anti-immigrant policies has gained more influences in France by using Islamophobic narratives. In its political campaign, Front National uses the concepts of Laicite to corner French Muslim in the public sphere. The presence of French Muslim community is considered as a threat toward secular values and Christian civilization. In this study, the author will analyze the increase of Islamophobia which has been triggered by the immigrant crisis and the influence of the right-wing movement. The concept of race by W. Thomas Schmid will serve as a theoretical framework to answer the increasing Islamophobia in France. To conduct the research, the author uses the qualitative method to analyze texts and narratives related to the Islamophobia acts in France. This research concluded with a statement that Islamophobia in France post-Arab Spring generally occurs in three aspect: cognitive, motivational and behavioral aspects. A tendency of certain groups in the French society which looks Islam as a racial problem becomes one of the main roots of the rise of Islamophobia in France.   Wacana Islamofobia di Eropa berkembang pesat, didorong oleh intensitas konflik di Timur Tengah yang tidak berkesudahan. Instabilitas yang melanda kawasan Timur Tengah pasca Arab Spring dan perang saudara di Suriah mendorong sebagian besar penduduknya untuk melakukan imigrasi ke berbagai wilayah di  Eropa, termasuk Perancis. Hal ini membangkitkan kembali perasaan Islamofobia di beberapa kalangan penduduk Perancis yang berkulit putih. Dalam kondisi ini, Front National sebagai partai ultra-nasionalis menjadikan narasi-narasi Islamofobia untuk merebut pengaruh dalam politik Perancis. Front National juga menggunakan konsep Laicite untuk menyudutkan masyarakat Muslim di ranah publik. Kehadiran kelompok Muslim di tengah-tengah penduduk Perancis dianggap dapat mengancam nilai-nilai sekuler dan peradaban Kristen. Dalam tulisan ini, penulis akan menganalisis mengapa terjadi peningkatan Islamofobia yang dipicu akibat krisis imigran serta pengaruh gerakan sayap kanan. Penelitian ini menggunakan konsep Ras yang dikembangkan oleh W. Thomas Schmid. Dalam melakukan riset, penulis menggunakan metode kualitatif untuk mengkaji teks serta naskah-naskah yang terkait dengan tindakan Islamofobia di Perancis. Penelitian ini mengungkapkan bahwa Islamofobia di Perancis setelah Arab Spring terjadi dalam 3 aspek, yakni aspek kognitif, motivasional, dan behavioral. Adanya kecenderungan sebagian masyarakat Perancis memandang Islam sebagai masalah rasial menjadi akar penting yang menyebabkan berkembangnya Islamofobia di Perancis.  },

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota is a dense microbial ecosystem with extensive opportunities for bacterial contact-dependent processes such as conjugation and Type VI secretion system (T6SS)-dependent antagonism. In the gut Bacteroidales, two distinct genetic architectures of T6SS loci, GA1 and GA2, are contained on Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICE). Despite intense interest in the T6SSs of the gut Bacteroidales, there is only a superficial understanding of their evolutionary patterns, and of their dissemination among Bacteroidales species in human gut communities. Here, we combine extensive genomic and metagenomic analyses to better understand their ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We identify new genetic subtypes, document extensive intrapersonal transfer of these ICE to Bacteroidales species within human gut microbiomes, and most importantly, reveal frequent population fixation of these newly armed strains in multiple species within a person. We further show the distribution of each of the distinct T6SSs in human populations and show there is geographical clustering. We reveal that the GA1 T6SS ICE integrates at a minimal recombination site leading to their integration throughout genomes and their frequent interruption of genes, whereas the GA2 T6SS ICE integrate at one of three different tRNA genes. The exclusion of concurrent GA1 and GA2 T6SSs in individual strains is associated with intact T6SS loci and with an ICE-encoded gene. By performing a comprehensive analysis of mobile genetic elements (MGE) in co-resident Bacteroidales species in numerous human gut communities, we identify 74 MGE that transferred to multiple Bacteroidales species within individual gut microbiomes. We further show that only three other MGE demonstrate multi-species spread in human gut microbiomes to the degree demonstrated by the GA1 and GA2 ICE. These data underscore the ubiquity and dissemination of mobile T6SS loci within Bacteroidales communities and across human populations.},

 abstract = {Summary During a karate competition, a competitor in the kata discipline may choose one kata of 102 katas on the list. This kata must not be repeated. Katas differ in duration, complexity, number of fast and slow techniques, which also means different intensity, physiological response of the karateka body and energy coverage.  Problems and Aim. In our study, we focused on the identification and assessment of the duration and difficulty of selected katas by monitoring the internal response of the human body (heart rate, lactate) of three top women´s Slovak national team karate competitors of kata individual categories during training and competition.   Methods. The research sample consisted of 3 karate kata athletes (age 17.3 years, body height 161.7 cm, body weight 55.7 kg), who trained kata on average 7 years. To evaluate the indicators of the internal body load in selected katas we used mean, standard deviation, min-max.   Results. The highest mean maximum heart rate values athletes had during performance kata Gojushi Ho (187 ± 8.2 bpm). The highest average heart rate values were observed during performance kata Chatanyara Kushanku (171 ± 9.9). Similarly, we found the highest mean values of blood lactate 4 minutes after performance kata Chatanyara Kushanku. (7.6 ± 2.5 mmol.l -1 ). The longest duration had the kata Suparinpei (204 ± 13 s). There was a significant difference in level of blood lactate reached in different katas (p ≤ 0.05) and the duration of katas.   Conclusions. The duration of 5 most common katas used at the high level competition is different (p ≤ 0.05), thus the intensity expressed by the frequency of the techniques, and heart rate and blood lactate concentration. ATP-PCr energy system seems to be the major contributor while contribution of the aerobic energy system rises with the increase in duration of kata. },

 abstract = {Summary Paragraph Among the biomolecules at the center of human health and molecular biology is a system of molecules that defines the human phenotype known as the metabolome. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis of fecal samples from human individuals from Africa and the Americas—the birthplace and the last continental expansion of our species, respectively—we present the characterization of the core human fecal metabolome. The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the core human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features like leucyl-leucine dipeptides and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a core human fecal metabolome. This study represents the first characterization of the core human fecal metabolome through untargeted analyses of populations along an industrialization gradient.},

 abstract = {Loss of gut microbial diversity1–6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.},

 abstract = {Humans have both intentional and unintentional impacts on their environment, yet identifying the enduring ecological legacies of past small-scale societies remains difficult, and as such, evidence is sparse. The present study found evidence of an ecological legacy that persists today within an semiarid ecosystem of western North America. Specifically, the richness of ethnographically important plant species is strongly associated with archaeological complexity and ecological diversity at Puebloan sites in a region known as Bears Ears on the Colorado Plateau. A multivariate model including both environmental and archaeological predictors explains 88% of the variation in ethnographic species richness (ESR), with growing degree days and archaeological site complexity having the strongest effects. At least 31 plant species important to five tribal groups (Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain Ute, and Apache), including the Four Corners potato (<i>Solanum jamesii</i>), goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium</i> sp.), wolfberry (<i>Lycium pallidum</i>), and sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), occurred at archaeological sites, despite being uncommon across the wider landscape. Our results reveal a clear ecological legacy of past human behavior: even when holding environmental variables constant, ESR increases significantly as a function of past investment in habitation and subsistence. Consequently, we suggest that propagules of some species were transported and cultivated, intentionally or not, establishing populations that persist to this day. Ensuring persistence will require tribal input for conserving and restoring archaeo-ecosystems containing "high-priority" plant species, especially those held sacred as lifeway medicines. This transdisciplinary approach has important implications for resource management planning, especially in areas such as Bears Ears that will experience greater visitation and associated impacts in the near future.},

But reliable access to water in sufficient quantities and quality is also critical for many nutrition-related behaviors and activities, including growing and cooking diverse foods. Given growing challenges to water availability and safety, including climate change, pollution, and infrastructure degradation, a broader conceptualization of water and its diverse uses is needed to sustainably achieve global nutrition targets. Therefore, we review empirical and qualitative evidence describing the linkages between water security (the reliable availability, accessibility, and quality of water for all household uses) and nutrition. Primary linkages include water security for drinking, food production and preparation, infant and young child feeding, and limiting exposure to pathogens and environmental toxins. We then identify knowledge gaps within each linkage and propose a research agenda for studying water security and nutrition going forward, including the concurrent quantification of both food and water availability, accessibility, use, and stability. By making explicit the connections between water security and nutritional well-being, we aim to promote greater collaboration between the nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Interdisciplinary policies and programs that holistically address the water-nutrition nexus, versus those that focus on water and nutrition independently, are likely to significantly advance our ability to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and safe water for all.},

 abstract = {Computational reconstruction of nearly complete genomes from metagenomic reads may identify thousands of new uncultured candidate bacterial species. We have shown that reconstructed prokaryotic genomes along with genomes of sequenced microbial isolates can be used to support more accurate gene prediction in novel <i>metagenomic</i> sequences. We have proposed an approach that used three types of gene prediction algorithms and found for all contigs in a metagenome nearly optimal models of protein-coding regions either in libraries of pre-computed models or constructed de novo. The model selection process and gene annotation were done by the new GeneMark-HM pipeline. We have created a database of the species level pan-genomes for the human microbiome. To create a library of models representing each pan-genome we used a self-training algorithm GeneMarkS-2. Genes initially predicted in each contig served as queries for a fast similarity search through the pan-genome database. The best matches led to selection of the model for gene prediction. Contigs not assigned to pan-genomes were analyzed by crude, but still accurate models designed for sequences with particular GC compositions. Tests of GeneMark-HM on simulated metagenomes demonstrated improvement in gene annotation of human metagenomic sequences in comparison with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools.},

This study analyzes the influence of grandmothers’ household residency on the presence of low height-for-age and excessive fat (FMI = fat mass [kg]/height [m2]), waist circumference, and sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds in a sample of 247 6- to 8-year-old urban Maya children from Yucatan, Mexico. Between September 2011 and January 2014, we obtained anthropometric and body composition data from children and mothers, as well as socioeconomic characteristics of participants and households. Grandmothers’ place of residence was categorized as either in the same household as their grandchildren (n = 71) or in separate households (n = 176). Multiple logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between grandmothers’ residency and outcome variables. Models were adjusted for maternal anthropometric characteristics and the following socioeconomic variables: family size, location, maternal education, monthly family income, and household crowding. Models showed that the presence of grandmothers in their grandchildren’s households was not associated with any of the outcome variables. In contrast, larger family size, overcrowding in the household, and lower family income predicted low height-for-age in children. Larger family size decreased the risk for being overweight based on the three parameters of body composition. Overcrowding in the household increased the risk for greater skinfolds thickness, while low family income increased the risk for higher fat mass index. The residency of grandmothers in their adult daughters’ households is not significantly associated with the outcome variables in this sample of urban Maya families. Instead, maternal anthropometric characteristics and socioeconomic conditions of the family have a greater influence on the overall growth of children.},

However, the vast majority of rRNA amplicon-based studies reported the conspicuous intercohort and interindividual variation for the prevalence of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in breast milk. In order to elucidate whether <i>Bifidobacterium</i> phylotypes persistently co-occured at the species or strain level in mother-breast milk-infant triads, we analyzed collectively the next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-specific <i>gro</i>EL gene from maternal feces, breast milk, and infant feces in a small yet very homogeneous cohort of 25 healthy Uyghur mother-infant pairs (lactation for 7-720 days) in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China. Overall, 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that microbiome in the newborn gut was closer to that of breast milk in the first 4 months of lactation, and subsequently showed an obvious trend of adulthood at 6-12 months. Based on the BLAST accurate taxonomic result of the representative sequences of all ASVs (amplicon sequencing variants), only three sets of ASVs could be clearly assigned into <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species, whereas the remaining eight sets of ASVs corresponded to four indefinite <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species group. By contrast, the <i>groEL</i> gene dataset was partitioned into 376 ASVs, at least belonging to 13 well-known <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species or subspecies, of which 15 ASVs, annotated to seven well-known <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species or subspecies, showed triadic synchronism in most 23 mother-infant pairs tested. However, several other rare bifidobacterial phylotypes, which were frequently encountered in animals, were found to display no correspondence of the presence between the three ecosystems of mother-infant pairs. Our test results were obviously to support the hypothesis that breast milk acts as an intermediary for the transfer of probiotic commensal bacteria from mother to infant, especially for endosymbiotic <i>Bifidobacterium</i> that can colonize the infant gut. Some oxygen-insensitive exogenous <i>Bifidobacterium</i> phylotypes with a cosmopolitan lifestyle may be indirectly transferred to breast milk and the infant's intestinal tract through environmental contamination. Thus, the <i>gro</i>EL gene proved to be a very effective target for the depth resolution of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> community by high-throughput sequencing technologies.},

 abstract = {An important public health question is understanding how changes in human environments can drive changes in the gut microbiota that influence risks associated with human health and wellbeing. It is well-documented that the modernization of societies is strongly correlated with intergenerational change in the frequency of nutrition-related chronic diseases in which microbial dysbiosis is implicated. The population of Bali, Indonesia, is well-positioned to study the interconnection between a changing food environment and microbiome patterns in its early stages, because of a recent history of modernization. Here, we characterize the fecal microbiota and diet history of the young adult women in Bali, Indonesia (n = 41) in order to compare microbial patterns in this generation with those of other populations with different histories of a modern food environment (industrialized supply chain). We found strong support for two distinct fecal microbiota community types in our study cohort at similar frequency: a Prevotella-rich (Type-P) and a Bacteroides-rich (Type-B) community (p < 0.001, analysis of similarity, Wilcoxon test). Although Type-P individuals had lower alpha diversity (p < 0.001, Shannon) and higher incidence of obesity, multivariate analyses with diet data showed that community types significantly influenced associations with BMI. In a multi-country dataset (n = 257), we confirmed that microbial beta diversity across subsistent and industrial populations was significantly associated with Prevotella and Bacteroides abundance (p < 0.001, generalized additive model) and that the prevalence of community types differs between societies. The young adult Balinese microbiota was distinctive in having an equal prevalence of two community types. Collectively, our study showed that the incorporation of community types as an explanatory factor into study design or modeling improved the ability to identify microbiome associations with diet and health metrics.},

 abstract = {The extended female postreproductive life span found in humans and some toothed whales remains an evolutionary puzzle. Theory predicts demographic patterns resulting in increased female relatedness with age (kinship dynamics) can select for a prolonged postreproductive life span due to the combined costs of intergenerational reproductive conflict and benefits of late-life helping. Here, we test this prediction using >40 years of longitudinal demographic data from the sympatric yet genetically distinct killer whale ecotypes: resident and Bigg's killer whales. The female relatedness with age is predicted to increase in both ecotypes, but with a less steep increase in Bigg's due to their different social structure. Here, we show that there is a significant postreproductive life span in both ecotypes with >30% of adult female years being lived as postreproductive, supporting the general prediction that an increase in local relatedness with age predisposes the evolution of a postreproductive life span. Differences in the magnitude of kinship dynamics however did not influence the timing or duration of the postreproductive life span with females in both ecotypes terminating reproduction before their mid-40s followed by an expected postreproductive period of about 20 years. Our results highlight the important role of kinship dynamics in the evolution of a long postreproductive life span in long-lived mammals, while further implying that the timing of menopause may be a robust trait that is persistent despite substantial variation in demographic patterns among populations.},

 abstract = {After spinal cord injury (SCI), patients face many physical and psychological issues including intestinal dysfunction and comorbidities, strongly affecting quality of life. The gut microbiota has recently been suggested to influence the course of the disease in these patients. However, to date only two studies have profiled the gut microbiota in SCI patients, months after a traumatic injury. Here we characterized the gut microbiota in a large Italian SCI population, within a short time from a not only traumatic injury. Feces were collected within the first week at the rehabilitation center (no later than 60 days after SCI), and profiled by 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing. Microbial profiles were compared to those publicly available of healthy age- and gender-matched Italians, and correlated to patient metadata, including type of SCI, spinal unit location, nutrition and concomitant antibiotic therapies. The gut microbiota of SCI patients shows distinct dysbiotic signatures, i.e. increase in potentially pathogenic, pro-inflammatory and mucus-degrading bacteria, and depletion of short-chain fatty acid producers. While robust to most host variables, such dysbiosis varies by lesion level and completeness, with the most neurologically impaired patients showing an even more unbalanced microbial profile. The SCI-related gut microbiome dysbiosis is very likely secondary to injury and closely related to the degree of completeness and severity of the lesion, regardless of etiology and time interval. This microbial layout could variously contribute to increased gut permeability and inflammation, potentially predisposing patients to the onset of severe comorbidities.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic human diseases by affecting microbial community function in the gut. We provide the first associations between urinary pesticide excretion and the composition and function of the faecal microbiome in 65 twin pairs in the UK. Biomonitoring of exposure to 186 common insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide residues showed the presence of pyrethroid and/or organophosphorus insecticide residues in all urine samples, while the herbicide glyphosate was found in 45% of individuals. Other pesticides such as DEET, imidacloprid or dithiocarbamate fungicides were less frequently detected. While the geographic location or the rural/urban environment had no influence on pesticide urinary excretion, food frequency questionnaires showed that DMTP levels, a metabolite of organophosphates, was higher with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Multivariable association between urinary pesticide excretion and faecal microbial composition and function were determined with shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics. A total of 34 associations between pesticide residues concentrations and faecal metabolite concentrations were detected. Glyphosate excretion was positively associated to an increased bacterial species richness, as well as to fatty acid metabolites and phosphate levels. The insecticide metabolite Br2CA, reflecting deltamethrin exposure, was positively associated with the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol and enterolactone, and negatively associated with some N-methyl amino acids. Urine metabolomics performed on a subset of samples did not reveal associations with the excretion of pesticide residues. Our results highlight the need for future interventional studies to understand effects of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome and possible health consequences.},

 abstract = {The vaginal microbiota is less complex than the gut microbiota, and the colonization of Lactobacillus in the female vagina is considered to be critical for reproductive health. Oral probiotics have been suggested as promising means to modulate vaginal homeostasis in the general population. In this study, 60 Chinese women were followed for over a year before, during, and after treatment with the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillusreuteri RC-14. Shotgun metagenomic data of 1334 samples from multiple body sites did not support a colonization route of the probiotics from the oral cavity to the intestinal tract and then to the vagina. Our analyses enable the classification of the cervicovaginal microbiome into a stable state and a state of dysbiosis. The microbiome in the stable group steadily maintained a relatively high abundance of Lactobacilli over one year, which was not affected by probiotic intake, whereas in the dysbiosis group, the microbiota was more diverse and changed markedly over time. Data from a subset of the dysbiosis group suggests this subgroup possibly benefited from supplementation with the probiotics, indicating that probiotics supplementation can be prescribed for women in a subclinical microbiome setting of dysbiosis, providing opportunities for targeted and personalized microbiome reconstitution.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe maternal microbiome has emerged as an important factor in gestational health and outcome and is associated with risk of preterm birth and offspring morbidity. Epidemiological evidence also points to successive pregnancies—referred to as maternal parity—as a risk factor for preterm birth, infant mortality, and impaired neonatal growth. Despite the fact that both the maternal microbiome and parity are linked to maternal-infant health, the impact of parity on the microbiome remains largely unexplored, in part due to the challenges of studying parity in humans.ResultsUsing synchronized pregnancies and dense longitudinal monitoring of the microbiome in pigs, we describe a microbiome trajectory during pregnancy and determine the extent to which parity modulates this trajectory. We show that the microbiome changes reproducibly during gestation and that this remodeling occurs more rapidly as parity increases. At the time of parturition, parity was linked to the relative abundance of several bacterial species, including Treponema bryantii, Lactobacillus amylovorus, and Lactobacillus reuteri. Strain tracking carried out in 18 maternal-offspring “quadrads”—each consisting of one mother sow and three piglets—linked maternal parity to altered levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, Prevotella stercorea, and Campylobacter coli in the infant gut 10 days after birth.ConclusionsCollectively, these results identify parity as an important environmental factor that modulates the gut microbiome during pregnancy and highlight the utility of a swine model for investigating the microbiome in maternal-infant health. In addition, our data show that the impact of parity extends beyond the mother and is associated with alterations in the community of bacteria that colonize the offspring gut early in life. The bacterial species we identified as parity-associated in the mother and offspring have been shown to influence host metabolism in other systems, raising the possibility that such changes may influence host nutrient acquisition or utilization. These findings, taken together with our observation that even subtle differences in parity are associated with microbiome changes, underscore the importance of considering parity in the design and analysis of human microbiome studies during pregnancy and in infants.EiSDZE1QSYbum5s8Ch3ZCDVideo abstract},

Furthermore, the taxonomic compositions of the conjugative elements differ from the composition of the metagenome assembled genomes, both in terms of the number of assembled elements and the relative abundances of the assembled systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of assembled conjugative elements are not included within metagenomic bins, and that only a small proportion of the binned conjugative systems are included in "high-quality" metagenomic bins. Our findings highlight that conjugative systems differ between a North American inflammatory bowel disease cohort and a cohort of North American pre-term infants, but in a manner different than metagenome assembled genomes, revealing a potential use as an age-related biomarker.

 abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that microbiota are involved in the physiology and pathology and have implications in health and disease. The role of microbiota in various physiological processes, including the immune system and brain function, is well established. A great deal of studies has suggested the role of gut microbes in the brain’s physiology and pathology. The maturation and development of the human central nervous system (CNS) are regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including microbiota. Studies mostly from germ-free animals or animals treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics show that specific microbiota can impact CNS physiology and neurochemical processes. The germ-free mice show neurological deficiencies in learning, memory, recognition, and emotional behaviors. Levels of the essential neurotransmitters such as serotonin, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor are different from those in commonly grown mice. In humans, evidence for interplay between gastrointestinal pathology and neuropsychiatric conditions was presented in anxiety, depression, and autism. The gut microbiota was involved in the development and homeostasis of CNS in various pathways. In this chapter the roles of microbiota and development and function of the nervous system, gut–brain interactions, neurodegeneration, and potential approaches for treating CNS disorders will be discussed.},

 abstract = {Changed dietary habits in Western countries such as reduced fiber intake represent an important lifestyle factor contributing to the increase in inflammatory immune-mediated diseases. The mode of action of beneficial fiber effects is not fully elucidated, but short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gut microbiota have been implicated. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of dietary fiber on lupus pathology and to understand underlying mechanisms. Here, we show that in lupus-prone NZB/WF1 mice low fiber intake deteriorates disease progression reflected in accelerated mortality, autoantibody production and immune dysregulation. In contrast to our original assumption, microbiota suppression by antibiotics or direct SCFA feeding did not influence the course of lupus-like disease. Mechanistically, our data rather indicate that in low fiber-fed mice, an increase in white adipose tissue mass, fat-inflammation and a disrupted intestinal homeostasis go along with systemic, low-grade inflammation driving autoimmunity. The links between obesity, intestinal leakage and low-grade inflammation were confirmed in human samples, while adaptive immune activation predominantly correlated with lupus activity. We further propose that an accelerated gastro-intestinal passage along with energy dilution underlies fiber-mediated weight regulation. Thus, our data highlight the often-overlooked effects of dietary fiber on energy homeostasis and obesity prevention. Further, they provide insight into how intricately the pathologies of inflammatory immune-mediated conditions, such as obesity and autoimmunity, might be interlinked, possibly sharing common pathways.},

 abstract = {Environmental exposures during pregnancy that alter both the maternal gut microbiome and the infant's risk of allergic disease and asthma include a traditional farm environment and consumption of unpasteurized cow's milk, antibiotic use, dietary fiber, and psychosocial stress. Multiple mechanisms acting in concert may underpin these associations and prime the infant to acquire immune competence and homeostasis following exposure to the extrauterine environment. Cellular and metabolic products of the maternal gut microbiome can promote the expression of microbial pattern recognition receptors, as well as thymic and bone marrow hematopoiesis relevant to regulatory immunity. At birth, transmission of maternally derived bacteria likely leverages this in utero programming to accelerate postnatal transition from a T<sub>H</sub>2- to T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>17-dominant immune phenotype and maturation of regulatory immune mechanisms, which in turn reduce the child's risk of allergic disease and asthma. Although our understanding of these phenomena is rapidly evolving, the field is relatively nascent, and we are yet to translate existing knowledge into interventions that substantially reduce disease risk in humans. Here, we review evidence that the maternal gut microbiome impacts the offspring's risk of allergic disease and asthma, discuss challenges and future directions for the field, and propose the hypothesis that maternal carriage of Prevotella copri during pregnancy decreases the offspring's risk of allergic disease via production of succinate, which in turn promotes bone marrow myelopoiesis of dendritic cell precursors in the fetus.},

Platinum-resistant patients showed a marked temporal reduction in GM diversity and increased instability with loss of health-associated taxa and increased proportions of <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Notably, most of these microorganisms are lactate producers, suggesting increased lactate production as supported by inferred metagenomics. In contrast, the GM of platinum-sensitive patients appeared overall more diverse and stable and enriched in lactate utilizers from the <i>Veillonellaceae</i> family. In conclusion, we identified potential GM signatures of therapeutic outcome in EOC patients, which could open up new opportunities for cancer prognosis and treatment.},

 abstract = {Abstract Two defining features of human sociality are large brains with neurally-dense cerebral cortices and the propensity to form complex social networks with non-kin. Large brains and the social networks in which they are embedded facilitate flows of fitness-enhancing information at multiple scales, but are also energetically expensive. In this paper, we consider how flows of energy and information interact to shape the macroscopic features of hunter-gatherer socioecology. Collective computation is the processing of information by complex adaptive systems to generate inferences in order to solve adaptive problems. In hunter-gatherer societies the adaptive problem is how to maximize fitness by optimizing information processing given the energy constraints of complex environments. The solution is the emergent macroscopic structure of the socioecology. Here we show how computation is extended across social networks to form the decentralized knowledge systems characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies. Data show that hunter-gatherer bands of co-residing families constitute computationally powerful networks that are embedded within hierarchically modular social networks that form complex metapopulations bound by fission-fusion dynamics at multiple scales facilitating the flow of information far beyond local interactions. These dynamics lead to the emergence of hunter-gatherer small-worlds where highly clustered local interactions are embedded within much larger, but sparsely connected metapopulations. Hunter-gatherers optimize local energy budgets in small groups but maintain interactions with much larger social networks while avoiding many of the ecological costs.},

No statistically significant differences were found between the same developmental stages of the two subspecies. The reverse, i.e., a decrease with developmental stage occurred in relation to the fatty acid composition. Most of the minerals were higher at advanced developmental stages. Overall, the high protein content (31.4-43.4%), small amount of fat (9.5-11.5%) and abundance of minerals such asiron and zinc, make drones a suitable nutritional resource. Even though nutrient content, especially protein, was higher in the pupae than the prepupae, we propose prepupae also as a commercial product based on their higher biomass production. Provided standard production protocols maintaining hygiene and safety will be adhered to, we propose that drone honey bees can be utilized as human food or animal feed.},

 abstract = {Living systems, from micro- to macro-scales, are strongly impacted by physical factors such as temperature, pH, and the concentration of compounds in their surrounding environment. In the macro-world, it is obvious that small changes in these parameters can have profound, and even devastating, impacts on an ecosystem. For example, in the case of global warming, a change in climate, and specifically a few degrees in temperature, has taken one million species of animals to the brink of extinction. Scale things down 6 orders of magnitude, our gut microbiota also experiences similar changes in temperature due to disease. In this highly competitive environment, physical perturbations inflict long-term consequences on the microbiota ecosystem and, in turn, on the host organism. My laboratory is exploring the feedback between the gut's physical environment, the microbiota, and disease. Our research highlights the importance of measuring physical parameters for the prediction of microbial dynamics and microbiota therapies.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota could affect human health and disease. Although disease-associated microbiota alteration has been extensively investigated in the Chinese population, a nationwide Chinese gut microbiota baseline is still lacking. Here we performed 16 S rRNA gene sequencing on fecal samples from 2678 healthy Chinese individuals, who belonged to eight ethnic groups and resided in 63 counties/cities of 28 provinces. We identified four enterotypes, three of which were enriched for Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Escherichia, respectively, whereas the fourth one had no dominant genus. By assessing the association between the gut microbiota and 20 variables belonging to six categories, geography, demography, diet, urbanization, lifestyle, and sampling month, we revealed that geography explained the largest microbiota variation, and clarified the distinct patterns in the associations with staple food type, ethnicity, and urban/rural residence. Specifically, the gut microbiota of Han Chinese and ethnic minority groups from the same sites was more alike than that of the same ethnic minority groups from different sites. Individuals consuming wheat as staple food were predicted to have more microbial genes involving in glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase and S-adenosyl-l-methionine biosynthesis than those who consumed rice, based on functional prediction. Besides, an appreciable effect of urbanization on decreased intra-individual diversity, increased inter-individual diversity, and increased proportion of the Bacteroides enterotype was observed. Collectively, our study provided a nationwide gut microbiota baseline of the Chinese population and knowledge on important covariates, which are fundamental to translational microbiota research.},

Proto-Bantu does not have such a series, nor do most East African Bantu languages. By contrast, three Bantu languages in northeastern Kenya (the northern Swahili dialects, Pokomo, Elwana) have acquired such a series, which thus merits explanation. There are three mechanisms involved: sounds along with loan vocabulary, (b) a simple phonological shift whereby inherited alveolars moved one place to become dental, and (c) a more complicated shift whereby inherited (pre) palatals bypassed an intervening alveolar series to become dental, a process little reported in the literature. It is hypothesised that these forms of denta1isation took place under historical conditions of contact with neighboring Cushitic communities--not the larger Eastern Cushitic communities of today (Somali, Orma), but rather the ancestral forms of what are now remnant languages, (probably) Southern Cushitic Dahalo and (possible) Eastern Cushitic Aweera.

While the exact biological mechanisms that cause this disease have largely remained elusive, host-genetics and environmental components such as the gut microbiome have been implicated. Using a large study population of 180 individuals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where konzo is most frequent, we investigate how the structure of the gut microbiome varied across geographical contexts, as well as provide the first insight into the gut flora of children affected with this debilitating disease using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our findings indicate that the gut microbiome structure is highly variable depending on region of sampling, but most interestingly, we identify unique enrichments of bacterial species and functional pathways that potentially modulate the susceptibility of konzo in prone regions of the Congo.},

Their potentially common microbial drivers advocate for treatment strategies aimed at restoring appropriate microbiome function, but individual variation in host factors makes a uniform approach unlikely. In this Perspective, we consolidate knowledge on diet–microbiome interactions in local inflammation, gut microbiota imbalance and host immune dysregulation. By understanding and incorporating the effects of individual dietary components on microbial metabolic output and host physiology, we examine the potential for diet-based therapies for autoimmune disease prevention and treatment. We also discuss tools targeting the gut microbiome, such as faecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics and orthogonal niche engineering, which could be optimized using custom dietary interventions. These approaches highlight paths towards leveraging diet for precise engineering of the gut microbiome at a time of increasing autoimmune disease.},

As a result, some individuals are choosing to bring companion animals in the home rather than raising children. <b>Purpose</b> The purpose of this study is to explore whether these transitions result in differential companion animal attachment and caregiving behavior in the homes of parents (or those who desire to become parents) and nonparents or childfree "pet parents." <b>Methods</b> A total of 917 respondents completed an online survey via Qualtrics that included demographic questions, the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS), and Likert-scale questions designed to probe direct and indirect caretaking behaviors. <b>Results</b> Nonparents reported more <i>Generalized Attachment</i> and more <i>Affective Responsiveness</i> to their companion animals, as well as increased investment in <i>General Care</i>. They also reported more <i>People Substituting</i> on the LAPS. Parents and nonparents reported similar agreement regarding <i>Animal Rights/Welfare</i> and <i>Training and Play</i>. <b>Conclusion</b> I conclude that nonparents' investment in companion animals much like parents invest in children, but in ways that meet species-specific needs. This supports the notion that nonparents may be nurturing companion animals as a trade-off to raising children, but not as a substitute. This is an evolutionarily novel application of parenting strategies in a new, flexible environment.},

 abstract = {Migratory animals experiencing substantial change in diet and habitat across the annual cycle may have corresponding shifts in host-associated microbial diversity. Using automated telemetry and radio tags to recapture birds, we examined gut microbiota structure in the same population and often same individual of Kirtland's Warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) initially sampled on their wintering grounds in The Bahamas and subsequently resampled within their breeding territories in Michigan, USA. Initial sampling occurred in March and April and resampling occurred in May, June and early July. The composition of the most abundant phyla and classes of the warblers' microbiota is similar to that of other migratory birds. However, we detected notable variation in abundance and diversity of numerous bacterial taxa, including a decrease in microbial richness and significant differences in microbial communities when comparing the microbiota of birds first captured in The Bahamas to that of birds recaptured in Michigan. This is observed at the individual and population level. Furthermore, we found that 22 bacterial genera exhibit heightened abundance within specific sampling periods and are probably associated with diet and environmental change. Finally, we described a small, species-specific shared microbial profile that spans multiple time periods and environments within the migratory cycle. Our research highlights that the avian gut microbiota is dynamic over time, most significantly impacted by changing environments associated with migration. These results support the need for full annual cycle monitoring of migratory bird microbiota to improve understanding of seasonal host movement ecologies and response to recurrent physiological stressors.},

 abstract = {The reduction of excessive weight remains a major public health challenge, with control currently limited to a calorie reduction strategy. Currently, attempts are being made at revisiting the fibre hypothesis based on the African studies of Denis Burkitt, that the lack of dietary fibre in the modern diet was responsible for the occurrence of obesity and many of the other non-communicable diseases of what he called “Western civilization”. However, the dilemma is that Burkitt himself stressed that other peoples of his day, such as the Maasai, remained healthy without consuming such high fibre diets. Equally, the present obesity epidemic is accompanied by diseases of a malfunctioning immune system and of poor mental health that do not seem to be adequately explained simply by a deficiency of dietary fibre. Though unknown in Burkitt’s day, an increasing degradation of a mutualistic intestinal microbiome would offer a better fit to the observed epidemiology, especially if the microbiome is not effectively passed on from mother to child at birth. Taking the broader view, in this article we posit a view of the microbiome as a cofactor of mammalian evolution, in which a maternal microbial inheritance complements the parental genetic inheritance of the animal, both engaging epigenetic processes. As this would require the microbiome to be fully integrated with the animal as it develops into an adult, so we have a meaningful evolutionary role for the microbiome–gut–brain axis. By a failure to correctly establish a microbiome–gut interface, the inhibition of maternal microbial inheritance sets the scene for the future development of non-communicable disease: compromised immune system function on the one hand and dysfunctional gut–brain communication on the other. The basic principle is that the fully functioning, diverse, microbiome achieves interkingdom communication by the generation of messenger chemicals, semiochemicals. It is envisaged that the in situ detection of these as yet ill-defined chemical entities by means of an ingestible sensor would indicate the severity of disease and provide a guide as to its amelioration.},

 abstract = {Kin relations have a strong theoretical and empirical basis for explaining cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, there is growing recognition that context—the cooperative environment of an individual—also shapes the willingness of individuals to cooperate. For nomadic pastoralists in Norway, cooperation among both kin and non-kin is an essential predictor for success. The northern parts of the country are characterized by a history of herder-herder competition exacerbating between-herder conflict, lack of trust, and subsequent coordination problems. In contrast, because of a history of herder-farmer competition, southern Norway is characterized by high levels of between-herder coordination and trust. This comparative study investigates the relative importance of “cooperative context” and kinship in structuring cooperative behavior using an experimental gift game. The main findings from this study were that in the South, a high level of cooperation around an individual pushes gifts to be distributed evenly among other herders. Nevertheless, kinship matters, since close kin give and receive larger gifts. In contrast, kinship seems to be the main factor affecting gift distribution in the North. Herders in the North are also concerned with distributing gifts equally, albeit limiting them to close kin: the level of intragroup cooperation drives gifts to be distributed evenly among other closely related herders. The observed regional contrasts in cooperative decisions fit with the different historical levels of conflict and trust in the two regions: whereas herders in the South are affected by both cooperative context and kinship, kinship seems to be the main determinant of cooperation in the North.},

 abstract = {Metagenomics studies have shown that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an altered gut microbiota. Whereas different microbiota patterns have been observed in independent human cohorts, reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria has consistently been found in individuals with T2D, as well as in those with prediabetes. Butyrate is produced in the large intestine by microbial fermentations, particularly of dietary fiber, and serves as primary fuel for colonocytes. It also acts as histone deacetylase inhibitor and ligand to G-protein coupled receptors, affecting cellular signaling in target cells, such as enteroendocrine cells. Therefore, butyrate has become an attractive drug target for T2D, and treatment strategies have been devised to increase its intestinal levels, for example by supplementation of butyrate-producing bacteria and dietary fiber, or through fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). In this review, we provide an overview of current literature indicating that these strategies have yielded encouraging results and short-term benefits in humans, but long-term improvements of glycemic control have not been reported so far. Further studies are required to find effective approaches to restore butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate levels in the human gut, and to investigate their impact on glucose regulation in T2D.},

Characteristics of the early child gut microbiome may influence the course of enteric infections, and enteric infections may change the composition of the gut microbiome, all of which may have long-term implications for child growth and development.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a community-based birth cohort study to examine interactions between gut microbiome conditions and enteric infections, and how environmental conditions affect the development of the gut microbiome. We will follow 360 newborns from 3 sites along a rural-urban gradient in northern coastal Ecuador, characterising enteric infections and gut microbial communities in the children every 3 to 6 months over their first 2 years of life. We will use longitudinal regression models to assess the correlation between environmental conditions and gut microbiome diversity and presence of specific taxa, controlling for factors that are known to be associated with the gut microbiome, such as diet. From 6 to 12 months of age, we will collect weekly stool samples to compare microbiome conditions in diarrhoea stools versus stools from healthy children prior to, during and after acute enteric infections, using principal-coordinate analysis and other multivariate statistical methods.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals have been obtained from Emory University and the Universidad San Francisco de Quito institutional review boards. The findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journals.},

In this study the hypoglycemic effect of live P. copri was confirmed in mice and pasteurization of P. copri was shown to further enhance its capacity to improve glucose tolerance. The safety of live and pasteurized P. copri was evaluated by a 29-day oral toxicity study in mice. P. copri did not induce any adverse effects on body growth. General examination of the mice, gross pathological and histological analysis showed no abnormalities of the vital organs. Though relative liver weights were lower in the pasteurized (4.574 g ± 0.096) and live (4.347 g ± 0.197) P. copri fed groups than in the control mice (5.005 g ± 0.103) (p = 0.0441 and p = 0.0147 respectively), no liver biochemical marker aberrations were detected. Creatinine serum levels were significantly lower in mice fed with live (p = 0.001) but not pasteurized (p = 0.163) P. copri compared to those of control mice. Haematological parameter analysis and low plasma Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP) levels ruled out systemic infection and inflammation. Immunomodulation capacity by P. copri as determined by blood plasma cytokine analysis was limited and gut colonisation occurred in only one of the 10 mice tested. Taken together, no major adverse effects were detected in P. copri treated groups compared to controls.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiome has gained increasing attention over the past two decades. Several findings have shown that this complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem can contribute to the maintenance of host health or, when subject to imbalances, to the pathogenesis of various enteric and non-enteric diseases. This scoping review summarizes the current knowledge on how the gut microbiota and microbially-derived compounds affect host metabolism, especially in the context of obesity and related disorders. Examples of microbiome-based targeted intervention strategies that aim to restore and maintain an eubiotic layout are then discussed. Adjuvant therapeutic interventions to alleviate obesity and associated comorbidities are traditionally based on diet modulation and the supplementation of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics. However, these approaches have shown only moderate ability to induce sustained changes in the gut microbial ecosystem, making the development of innovative and tailored microbiome-based intervention strategies of utmost importance in clinical practice. In this regard, the administration of next-generation probiotics and engineered microbiomes has shown promising results, together with more radical intervention strategies based on the replacement of the dysbiotic ecosystem by means of fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors or with the introduction of synthetic communities specifically designed to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome. Finally, we provide a perspective for future translational investigations through the implementation of bioinformatics approaches, including machine and deep learning, to predict health risks and therapeutic outcomes.},

 abstract = {Neanderthals collected unusual, sometimes colorful mineral materials from different sources. Several green serpentinite smooth pebbles with a flat shape and use modifications were unearthed at Fumane Cave in northern Italy. This study explores cognitive and functional criteria that influenced the selection and use of unique pebbles based on their regional geology, morphology, petrology, use wear, and residues. Besides the attraction for green materials, there is no evidence for the use of soft green and flat pebbles, like those from Fumane Cave, during the Middle Palaeolithic. Moreover, these materials were collected by Neanderthals only from ca. 44 ka cal BP, despite the large availability of green serpentine pebbles in the alluvial beds near the cave. Ultimately, we provide new data to understand the role of aesthetic and technological factors in shaping the human behavioral range in the Middle Paleolithic.},

 abstract = {In many societies, grandmothers are important caregivers, and grandmaternal investment is often associated with improved grandchild well-being. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first study to examine grandmaternal brain function. We recruited 50 grandmothers with at least one biological grandchild between 3 and 12 years old. Brain function was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging as grandmothers viewed pictures of their grandchild, an unknown child, the same-sex parent of the grandchild, and an unknown adult. Grandmothers also completed questionnaires to measure their degree of involvement with and attachment to their grandchild. After controlling for age and familiarity of stimuli, viewing grandchild pictures activated areas involved with emotional empathy (insula and secondary somatosensory cortex) and movement (motor cortex and supplementary motor area). Grandmothers who more strongly activated areas involved with cognitive empathy (temporo-parietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) when viewing pictures of the grandchild desired greater involvement in caring for the grandchild. Finally, compared with results from an earlier study of fathers, grandmothers more strongly activated regions involved with emotional empathy (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula and secondary somatosensory cortex), and motivation (nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and caudate nucleus). All in all, our findings suggest that emotional empathy may be a key component of grandmaternal responses to their grandchildren.},

 abstract = {Despite well-established knowledge of the role of diet and the geographic effect on the gut microbiota of human populations, the temporal dynamics of the individual microbiota profile across changes associated with intercontinental short residence are still far from being understood. This pilot study sought to provide insights into the trajectory of the gut microbiota of an individual during a two-month stay in Italy and a subsequent two-month stay in Nigeria, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and inferred metagenomics. The gut microbiota underwent massive but temporary changes, both taxonomically and based on predicted functionality. The faecal microbiota associated with the short stay in Italy progressively lost diversity and showed a dominance of Firmicutes, while after returning to Nigeria, the microbial community quickly regained the typical profile, in terms of biodiversity and bacterial signatures of traditional lifestyle, i.e., <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Treponema</i>. Predicted pathways involved in glycolysis, fermentation and N-acetylneuraminate degradation were enriched during the subsequent two-month stay in Nigeria, whereas pathways associated with amino acid and peptidoglycan synthesis and maturation became over-represented during short stay in Italy. Our findings stress the plasticity of the individual gut microbiota even during a short-term travel, with loss/gain of taxonomic and functional features that mirror those of the gut microbiota of indigenous people dwelling therein.},

 abstract = {Colonization dramatically impacted native ecosystems and Indigenous foodways in the Alta California coastal regions, but its impact in colonial hinterland landscapes remains poorly understood. This study contributes information on the indirect effects of colonial ecological transformations on hinterland Indigenous foodways by examining archaeofauna from the California Historical Landmark Black Star Canyon Puhú village (CHL#217; CA-ORA-132/317) in the Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County, California. In 1832 CE, the Indigenous residents of Puhú were allegedly subsisting off stolen livestock and were massacred in retaliation by colonists. Zooarchaeological analyses of the village revealed a continuation of montane endemic hunting traditions whereas livestock had a minimal, if not non-existent, impact on the community's foodways. We suggest that the outcome of postcolonial ecological change on food availability was variable in proximal hinterland areas, and for the Puhú village, potentially enhanced access to certain native faunal resources, which enabled a different mode of cultural persistence.},

Urban poor families were more food secure, though vegetable avoidance and poor micronutrient adequacy were observed. Rather than mitigate threats to undernutrition, rural households’ reliance on home food agriculture heightened risk to food insecurity, as the Philippines is vulnerable to crop-destroying tropical storms.

 abstract = {Periodontal disease is classically characterized by progressive destruction of the soft and hard tissues of the periodontal complex, mediated by an interplay between dysbiotic microbial communities and aberrant immune responses within gingival and periodontal tissues. Putative periodontal pathogens are enriched as the resident oral microbiota becomes dysbiotic and inflammatory responses evoke tissue destruction, thus inducing an unremitting positive feedback loop of proteolysis, inflammation, and enrichment for periodontal pathogens. Keystone microbial pathogens and sustained gingival inflammation are critical to periodontal disease progression. However, recent studies have revealed the importance of previously unidentified microbes involved in disease progression, including various viruses, phages and bacterial species. Moreover, newly identified immunological and genetic mechanisms, as well as environmental host factors, including diet and lifestyle, have been discerned in recent years as further contributory factors in periodontitis. These factors have collectively expanded the established narrative of periodontal disease progression. In line with this, new ideologies related to maintaining periodontal health and treating existing disease have been explored, such as the application of oral probiotics, to limit and attenuate disease progression. The role of systemic host pathologies, such as autoimmune disorders and diabetes, in periodontal disease pathogenesis has been well noted. Recent studies have additionally identified the reciprocated importance of periodontal disease in potentiating systemic disease states at distal sites, such as in Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and oral cancer, further highlighting the importance of the oral cavity in systemic health. Here we review long-standing knowledge of periodontal disease progression while integrating novel research concepts that have broadened our understanding of periodontal health and disease. Further, we delve into innovative hypotheses that may evolve to address significant gaps in the foundational knowledge of periodontal disease.},

 abstract = {Emerging evidence shows that the gut microbiota interacts with environmental pollutants, but the effect of early exposure on the neonatal microbiome remains unknown. We investigated the association between maternal exposure to environmental pollutants and changes in early-life gut microbiome development. We surveyed 16S rRNA gene on meconium and fecal samples (at 1, 3, and 6 months) from the Brazilian birth cohort, and associated with levels of metals, perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS), and pesticides in maternal and umbilical cord blood. The results indicate that the magnitude of the microbiome changes associated with increasing pollutant exposure was bigger in cesarean-section (CS) born and CS-born-preterm babies, in relation to vaginally (VG) delivered infants. Breastfeeding was associated with a stronger pollutant-associated effect on the infant feces, suggesting that the exposure source could be maternal milk. Differences in microbiome effects associated with maternal or cord blood pollutant concentrations suggest that fetal exposure time - intrauterine or perinatal - may matter. Finally, despite the high developmental microbiota variability, specific microbionts were consistently affected across all pollutants, with taxa clusters found in samples from infants exposed to the highest toxicant exposure. The results evidence that perinatal exposure to environmental pollutants is associated with alterations in gut microbiome development which may have health significance.},

Here, we evaluated gut microbiome features and their associations with immigration, dietary intake, and obesity in 2640 individuals from a population-based study of US Hispanics/Latinos.ResultsThe fecal shotgun metagenomics data indicate that greater US exposure is associated with reduced ɑ-diversity, reduced functions of fiber degradation, and alterations in individual taxa, potentially related to a westernized diet. However, a majority of gut bacterial genera show paradoxical associations, being reduced with US exposure and increased with fiber intake, but increased with obesity. The observed paradoxical associations are not explained by host characteristics or variation in bacterial species but might be related to potential microbial co-occurrence, as seen by positive correlations among Roseburia, Prevotella, Dorea, and Coprococcus. In the conditional analysis with mutual adjustment, including all genera associated with both obesity and US exposure in the same model, the positive associations of Roseburia and Prevotella with obesity did not persist, suggesting that their positive associations with obesity might be due to their co-occurrence and correlations with obesity-related taxa, such as Dorea and Coprococcus.ConclusionsAmong US Hispanics/Latinos, US exposure is associated with unfavorable gut microbiome profiles for obesity risk, potentially related to westernized diet during acculturation. Microbial co-occurrence could be an important factor to consider in future studies relating individual gut microbiome taxa to environmental factors and host health and disease.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Epigenetic regulation is considered the main molecular mechanism underlying the developmental origin of health and disease's (DOHAD) hypothesis. Previous studies that have investigated the role of paternal exercise on the metabolic health of the offspring did not control for the amount and intensity of the training or possible effects of adaptation to exercise and produced conflicting results regarding the benefits of parental exercise to the next generation. We employed a precisely regulated exercise regimen to study the transgenerational inheritance of improved metabolic health.
METHODS: We subjected male mice to a well-controlled exercise -training program to investigate the effects of paternal exercise on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in their adult progeny. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance, we determined chromatin markers in the skeletal muscle of the offspring and the paternal sperm.
RESULTS: Offspring of trained male mice exhibited improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Paternal exercise modulated the DNA methylation profile of PI3Kca and the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus at specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the skeletal muscle of the offspring, which affected their gene expression. Remarkably, a similar DNA methylation profile at the PI3Kca, H19, and Igf2 genes was present in the progenitor sperm indicating that exercise-induced epigenetic changes that occurred during germ cell development contributed to transgenerational transmission.
CONCLUSION: Paternal exercise might be considered as a strategy that could promote metabolic health in the offspring as the benefits can be inherited transgenerationally.},

 abstract = {Tree-based diversity measures incorporate phylogenetic or functional relatedness into comparisons of microbial communities. This can improve the identification of explanatory factors compared to tree-agnostic diversity measures. However, applying tree-based diversity measures to metagenome data is more challenging than for single-locus sequencing (e.g. 16S rRNA gene). Utilizing the Genome Taxonomy Database for species-level metagenome profiling allows for functional diversity measures based on genomic content or traits inferred from it. Still, it is unclear how metagenome-based assessments of microbiome diversity benefit from incorporating phylogeny or function into measures of diversity. We assessed this by measuring phylogeny-based, function-based and tree-agnostic diversity measures from a large, global collection of human gut metagenomes composed of 30 studies and 2943 samples. We found tree-based measures to explain phenotypic variation (e.g. westernization, disease status and gender) better or equivalent to tree-agnostic measures. Ecophylogenetic and functional diversity measures provided unique insight into how microbiome diversity was partitioned by phenotype. Tree-based measures greatly improved machine learning model performance for predicting westernization, disease status and gender, relative to models trained solely on tree-agnostic measures. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of tree- and function-based measures for metagenomic assessments of microbial diversity, which is a fundamental component of microbiome science.},

 abstract = {Seasonal variations in gut microbiota of small mammals and how they are influenced by environmental variables are relatively poorly understood. We sampled 162 wild plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) in 4 seasons over 2 and a half years and recorded the air temperature, precipitation, and nutrient content in edible vegetation at the sampling site. After conducting 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we found that the highest alpha diversity, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and the simplest co-occurrence network occurred in winter, whereas the highest relative abundance of Proteobacteria and the most complex network structure were observed in spring. The highest relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota and Spirochaetota was seen in summer and autumn, respectively. Air temperature, precipitation, and the contents of crude protein, crude fiber, and polysaccharide in vegetation had significant effects on the seasonal changes in gut microbiota. Diet contributed more to microbial variation than climatic factors. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the amino acid metabolism pathway and axillary activity enzymes were most abundant in summer, while abundance of carbohydrate-binding modules and carbohydrate esterases was highest in spring. These microbial variations were related to the changes in dietary nutrition, indicating that gut microbiota of plateau pika contribute to the efficient use of food resources. This study provides new evidence of how external environmental factors affect the intestinal environment of small mammals.},

We re-examined their colour naming using a novel computer-based method drawing colours from across the gamut rather than only from the saturated shell of colour space that is the norm in cross-cultural colour research. Measuring confidence in communication, the Himba now have seven terms, or more properly categories, that are independent of other colour terms. Thus, we report the first augmentation of major terms, namely green and brown, to a colour lexicon in any language. A critical examination of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning approaches across the two datasets collected at different periods shows that perceptual mechanisms can, at most, only to some extent explain colour category formation and that cultural factors, such as linguistic similarity are the critical driving force for augmenting colour terms and effective colour communication.},

 abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is increasingly recognized as a complex metabolic disorder that manifests in genetically susceptible women following a range of negative exposures to nutritional and environmental factors related to contemporary lifestyle. The hypothesis that PCOS phenotypes are derived from a mismatch between ancient genetic survival mechanisms and modern lifestyle practices is supported by a diversity of research findings. The proposed evolutionary model of the pathogenesis of PCOS incorporates evidence related to evolutionary theory, genetic studies, in utero developmental epigenetic programming, transgenerational inheritance, metabolic features including insulin resistance, obesity and the apparent paradox of lean phenotypes, reproductive effects and subfertility, the impact of the microbiome and dysbiosis, endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure, and the influence of lifestyle factors such as poor-quality diet and physical inactivity. Based on these premises, the diverse lines of research are synthesized into a composite evolutionary model of the pathogenesis of PCOS. It is hoped that this model will assist clinicians and patients to understand the importance of lifestyle interventions in the prevention and management of PCOS and provide a conceptual framework for future research. It is appreciated that this theory represents a synthesis of the current evidence and that it is expected to evolve and change over time.},

 abstract = {Historically, humans have interacted with soils, which contain a rich source of microorganisms. Fruit and vegetable gardening is the primary interaction humans have with soil today. Animal research reveals that soil microorganisms can be transferred to the rodent intestine. However, studies on fecal and soil microbial changes associated with gardening in humans are lacking. The current case-controlled cohort study aimed to characterize the fecal and soil microbiota of gardening families (n = 10) and non-gardening (control) families (n = 9). Families included two adults and one child (5–18 years) for a total of 56 participants. All participants provided a fecal sample, soil sample, and diet history questionnaires before the gardening season (April) and during the peak of the gardening season (August). Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) scores and nutrient analysis were performed. Fecal and soil DNA were extracted and amplified. Sequence data were then processed and analyzed. Peak season gardening families tended to have greater fecal operational features, a greater Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity score, greater fiber intake, and higher abundances of fiber fermenting bacteria than peak control families. Soil endemic microbes were also shared with gardening participant’s fecal samples. This study revealed that the fecal microbiota of gardening families differs from non-gardening families, and that there are detectable changes in the fecal microbial community of gardeners and their family members over the course of the gardening season. Additional research is necessary to determine if changes induced by gardening on the gut microbiota contribute to human health.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiome plays a central role in health and disease. Environmental factors, such as lifestyle and diet, are known to shape the gut microbiome as well as the reservoir of resistance genes that these microbes harbour; the resistome. In this study we assessed whether long-term dietary habits within a single geographical region (the Netherlands) impact the human gut resistome. Faecal samples from Dutch omnivores, pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans were analysed by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) (n = 149) and resistome capture sequencing approach (ResCap) (n = 64). Among all diet groups, 119 and 145 unique antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected by MSS or ResCap, respectively. Five or fifteen ARGs were shared between all diet groups, based on MSS and ResCap, respectively. The total number of detected ARGs by MSS or ResCap was not significantly different between the groups. MSS also revealed that vegans have a distinct microbiome composition, compared to other diet groups. Vegans had a lower abundance of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis compared to pescatarians and a lower abundance of S. thermophilus when compared to omnivores. In summary, our study showed that long-term dietary habits are not associated with a specific resistome signature.},

We relate Strenger’s thinking in this regard to socioevolutionary and developmental psychopathology approaches concerning the role of culture in engendering a sense of agency and selfhood. These views illustrate our own shift in thinking concerning the role of psychological and sociocultural factors in the development and course of psychopathology.

 abstract = {Two key features of human sociality are anatomically complex brains with neuron-dense cerebral cortices, and the propensity to form complex social networks with non-kin. Complex brains and complex social networks facilitate flows of fitness-enhancing energy and information at multiple scales of social organization. Here, we consider how these flows interact to shape the emergence of macroscopic regularities in hunter-gatherer macroecology relative to other mammals and non-human primates. Collective computation is the processing of information by complex adaptive systems to generate inferences in order to solve adaptive problems. In hunter-gatherer societies the adaptive problem is to resolve uncertainty in generative models used to predict complex environments in order to maximize inclusive fitness. The macroecological solution is to link complex brains in social networks to form collective brains that perform collective computations. By developing theory and analyzing data, the author shows hunter-gatherers bands of ~ 16 people, or ~4 co-residing families, form the largest collective brains of any social mammal. Moreover, because individuals, families, and bands interact at multiple time scales, these fission-fusion dynamics lead to the emergence of the macroscopic regularities in hunter-gatherer macroecology we observe in cross-cultural data. These results show how computation is distributed across spatially-extended social networks forming decentralized knowledge systems characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies. The flow of information at scales far beyond daily interactions leads to the emergence of small-worlds where highly clustered local interactions are embedded within much larger, but sparsely connected multilevel metapopulations.},

 abstract = {Few data exist on the human gut mycobiome in relation to lifestyle, ethnicity, and dietary habits. To understand the effect of these factors on the structure of the human gut mycobiome, we analyzed sequences belonging to two extinct pre-Columbian cultures inhabiting Puerto Rico (the Huecoid and Saladoid) and compared them to coprolite samples found in Mexico and Ötzi, the Iceman's large intestine. Stool mycobiome samples from extant populations in Peru and urban cultures from the United States were also included. The ancient Puerto Rican cultures exhibited a lower fungal diversity in comparison to the extant populations. Dissimilarity distances showed that the Huecoid gut mycobiome resembled that from ancient Mexico. Fungal genera including <i>Aspergillus</i> spp., <i>Penicillium</i> spp., <i>Rasamsonia</i> spp., <i>Byssochlamys</i> spp., <i>Talaromyces</i> spp., <i>Blastomyces</i> spp., <i>Monascus</i> spp., and <i>Penicilliopsis</i> spp. were differentially abundant in the ancient and extant populations. Despite cultural differences, certain fungal taxa were present in all samples. These results suggest that culture and diet may impact the gut mycobiome and emphasize that modern lifestyles could be associated with the alteration of gut mycobiome diversity. The present study presents data on ancient and extant human gut mycobiomes in terms of lifestyle, ethnicity, and diet in the Americas.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between breastfeeding and sleep of the gestational parent is poorly understood. This longitudinal study investigated how breastfeeding is associated with total nighttime sleep duration and sleep efficiency (percentage of total sleep time in bed) in nulliparous participants over the first two postpartum years.
METHODS: Nulliparous participants (N = 155, M<sub>age</sub>  = 33.45, SD<sub>age</sub>  = 3.50) self-reported patterns of breastfeeding via telephone interviews and sleep via self-report at 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postpartum. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models, with breastfeeding variables as predictors and sleep variables as outcomes, controlling for relevant covariates.
RESULTS: Neither the presence of breastfeeding nor the percentage of human milk in infants' total diets was significantly associated with participants' sleep duration or sleep quality (P-values &gt; 0.08). This finding held after controlling for the number of nighttime feeds (P-values &gt; 0.11). However, greater numbers of nighttime feeds, regardless of feeding content, were strongly associated with shorter sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency (P-values &lt; 0.05). On average, with each additional nighttime feed, nocturnal sleep duration decreased by 6.6-8.4 minutes, and sleep efficiency decreased by 2.88%-3.02%.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study showed that breastfeeding per se was not associated with shorter or poor nocturnal sleep, but the number of nighttime feeds was. Sharing nighttime infant care amongst different carers in the household could help reduce postpartum sleep disturbance and ameliorate its negative impact on wellbeing.},

Given that the emerging research has pointed to the influence of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the ontogeny of aggression, we aimed to analyze the association of its genetic polymorphisms with CD. The study included 228 male adolescent subjects (120 with and 108 without CD). CD was diagnosed according to Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV criteria, while evaluations of aggressive/dissociative behaviors were performed using psychometric questionnaires including the PCL-YV, OAS-M, KADS, and CBCL. Platelet 5-HT concentration was determined by spectrophotofluorometry. Genotyping of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor polymorphisms rs2070040, rs9534511, rs4142900, rs9534512 was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Subjective irritability, physical aggression toward others, and antisocial behavior were strongly associated with the G allele of rs2070040 and rs4142900, and the C allele of rs9534511 and rs9534512. A significantly increased platelet 5-HT concentration in CD subjects, compared to controls, was lost after the correction according to the smoking status. Our results indicate an association of the studied HTR2A polymorphisms and their haplotypes with irritability and impulsivity traits, which may contribute to the aggressive and antisocial behavior in male adolescents with CD.},

TMAO is well documented, but same can not be said of TMA-producing bacteria. This work aimed to identify TMA-producing genera in human intestinal microbiota. We retrieved the genomes of human-associated microorganisms from the Human Microbiome Project database comprising 1751 genomes, Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome collection consisting 4644 gut prokaryotes, recapitulated 4930 species-level genome bins and public gut metagenomic data of 2134 individuals from 11 populations. By sequence searching, 216 TMA-lyase-containing species from 102 genera were found to contain the homologous sequences of cntA/B, yeaW/X, and/or cutC/D. We identified 13 strains from 5 genera with cntA sequences, and 30 strains from 14 genera with cutC showing detectable relative abundance in healthy individuals. Lachnoclostridium (p = 2.9e−05) and Clostridium (p = 5.8e−04), the two most abundant cutC-containing genera, were found to be much higher in atherosclerotic patients compared with healthy persons. Upon incubation with choline (substrate), L. saccharolyticum effectively transformed it to TMA at a rate higher than 98.7% while that for C. sporogenes was 63.8–67.5% as detected by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. In vivo studies further showed that treatment of L. saccharolyticum and choline promoted a significant increase in TMAO level in the serum of ApoE−/− mice with obvious accumulation of aortic plaque in same. This study discloses the significance and efficiency of the gut bacterium L. saccharolyticum in transforming choline to TMA and consequently promoting the development of atherosclerosis.},

Substantial changes in host metabolism and immunity around the time of weaning may be accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. In this study, we systematically evaluated differences in the gut microbiome and host metabolites among three weaning periods using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling in piglets.ResultsWe identified that P. copri was the most significantly different species among three weaning periods, and was the key bacterial species for mitigating piglet adaptation during the weaning transition, while Bacillus_phage_BCD7, the only differential bacteriophages, was significantly and positively correlated with P. copri enriched in day 28 group. Additionally, P. copri and Bacillus_phage_BCD7 was significantly correlated with the shifts of functional capacities of the gut microbiome and several CAZymes in day 28 group. Furthermore, the altered metabolites we observed were enriched in pathways matched to the functional capacity of the gut microbiome e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.ConclusionThe results from this study indicate that the bacteria-phage interactions and host-microbial interactions during the weaning transition impact host metabolism, leading to beneficial host changes among three weaning periods.},

 abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has risen to its highest values over the last two decades. While many studies have either shown brain or microbiome connections to obesity, few have attempted to analyze the brain-gut-microbiome relationship in a large cohort adjusting for cofounders. Therefore, we aim to explore the connection of the brain-gut-microbiome axis to obesity controlling for such cofounders as sex, race, and diet. Whole brain resting state functional MRI was acquired, and connectivity and brain network properties were calculated. Fecal samples were obtained from 287 obese and non-obese participants (males n = 99, females n = 198) for 16s rRNA profiling and fecal metabolites, along with a validated dietary questionnaire. Obesity was associated with alterations in the brain's reward network (nucleus accumbens, brainstem). Microbial diversity (p = .03) and composition (p = .03) differed by obesity independent of sex, race, or diet. Obesity was associated with an increase in <i>Prevotella</i>/<i>Bacteroides</i> (P/B) ratio and a decrease in fecal tryptophan (p = .02). P/B ratio was positively correlated to nucleus accumbens centrality (p = .03) and negatively correlated to fecal tryptophan (p = .004). Being Hispanic, eating a standard American diet, having a high <i>Prevotella</i>/<i>Bacteroides</i> ratio, and a high nucleus accumbens centrality were all independent risk factors for obesity. There are obesity-related signatures in the BGM-axis independent of sex, race, and diet. Race, diet, P/B ratio and increased nucleus accumbens centrality were independent risk factors for obesity. P/B ratio was inversely related to fecal tryptophan, a metabolite related to serotonin biosynthesis, and positively related to nucleus accumbens centrality, a region central to the brain's reward center. These findings may expand the field of therapies for obesity through novel pathways directed at the BGM axis.},

The probability of such loss is the extinction probability of an individual with a random lifetime reproductive success (LRS). We show here that the traditional approximation of extinction probability in terms of the mean and variance of LRS does not always apply, because the LRS has a skewed, often multimodal, distribution. To exemplify distinct life history patters, we use the Hadza and Pacific Chinook salmon. The traditional approximation overestimates the exact extinction probability from complete LRS distribution. An accurate analysis of the distribution of LRS strengthens our ability to successfully analyze evolution.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a roadmap for engaging in cross-cultural, developmental research in practical, ethical, and community-engaged ways. To cultivate the flexibility necessary for conducting cross-cultural research, we structure our roadmap as a series of questions that each research program might consider prior to embarking on cross-cultural examinations in developmental science. Within each topic, we focus on the challenges and opportunities inherent to different types of study designs, fieldwork, and collaborations because our collective experience in conducting research in multiple cultural contexts has taught us that there can be no single “best practice”. Here we identify the challenges that are unique to cross-cultural research as well as present a series of recommendations and guidelines. We also bring to the forefront ethical considerations which are rarely encountered in the laboratory context, but which researchers face daily while conducting research in a cultural context which one is not a member. As each research context requires unique solutions to these recurring challenges, we urge researchers to use this set of questions as a starting point, and to expand and tailor the questions and potential solutions with community members to support their own research design or cultural context.

 abstract = {Human lifestyle and its relationship with the human microbiome has been a line of research widely studied. This is because, throughout human history, civilizations have experienced different environments and lifestyles that could have promoted changes in the human microbiome. The comparison between industrialized and non-industrialized human populations in several studies has allowed to observe variation in the microbiome structure due to the population lifestyle. Nevertheless, the lifestyle of human populations is a gradient where several subcategories can be described. Yet, it is not known how these different lifestyles of human populations affect the microbiome structure on a large scale. Therefore, the main goal of this work was the collection and comparison of 16S data from the gut microbiome of populations that have different lifestyles around the world. With the data obtained from 14 studies, it was possible to compare the gut microbiome of 568 individuals that represent populations of hunter-gatherers, agricultural, agropastoral, pastoral, and urban populations. Results showed that industrialized populations present less diversity than those from non-industrialized populations, as has been described before. However, by separating traditional populations into different categories, we were able to observe patterns that cannot be appreciated by encompassing the different traditional lifestyles in a single category. In this sense, we could confirm that different lifestyles exhibit distinct alpha and beta diversity. In particular, the gut microbiome of pastoral and agropastoral populations seems to be more similar to those of urban populations according to beta diversity analysis. Beyond that, beta diversity analyses revealed that bacterial composition reflects the different lifestyles, representing a transition from hunters-gatherers to industrialized populations. Also, we found that certain groups such as <i>Bacteoidaceae</i>, <i>Lanchospiraceae</i>, and <i>Rickenellaceae</i> have been favored in the transition to modern societies, being differentially abundant in urban populations. Thus, we could hypothesize that due to adaptive/ecological processes; multifunctional bacterial groups (e.g., <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>) could be replacing some functions lost in the transition to modern lifestyle.},

 abstract = {Accurate data are essential for investigating relationships between maternal time-use patterns and nutritional outcomes. The 24 h recall (24HR) has traditionally been used to collect time-use data, however, automated wearable cameras (AWCs) with an image-assisted recall (IAR) may reduce recall bias. This study aimed to evaluate their concurrent criterion validity for assessing women's time use in rural Eastern Ugandan. Women's (<i>n</i> = 211) time allocations estimated via the AWC-IAR and 24HR methods were compared with direct observation (criterion method) using the Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) method of analysis and Cronbach's coefficient alpha (time allocation) or Cohen's κ (concurrent activities). Systematic bias varied from 1 min (domestic chores) to 226 min (caregiving) for 24HR and 1 min (own production) to 109 min (socializing) for AWC-IAR. The LOAs were within 2 h for employment, own production, and self-care for 24HR and AWC-IAR but exceeded 11 h (24HR) and 9 h (AWC-IAR) for caregiving and socializing. The LOAs were within four concurrent activities for 24HR (-1.1 to 3.7) and AWC-IAR (-3.2 to 3.2). Cronbach's alpha for time allocation ranged from 0.1728 (socializing) to 0.8056 (own production) for 24HR and 0.2270 (socializing) to 0.7938 (own production) for AWC-IAR. For assessing women's time allocations at the population level, the 24HR and AWC-IAR methods are accurate and reliable for employment, own production, and domestic chores but poor for caregiving and socializing. The results of this study suggest the need to revisit previously published research investigating the associations between women's time allocations and nutrition outcomes.},

 abstract = {BackgroundDietary habits have a profound influence on the metabolic activity of gut microorganisms and their influence on health. Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic disease by affecting the gut microbiome. We performed the first pesticide biomonitoring survey of the British population, and subsequently used the results to perform the first pesticide association study on gut microbiome composition and function from the TwinsUK registry.MethodsDietary exposure of 186 common insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide residues and the faecal microbiome in 65 twin pairs in the UK was investigated. We evaluated if dietary habits, geographic location, or the rural/urban environment, are associated with the excretion of pesticide residues. The composition and metabolic activity of faecal microbiota was evaluated using shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics respectively. We performed a targeted urine metabolomics analysis in order to evaluate whether pesticide urinary excretion was also associated with physiological changes.ResultsPyrethroid and/or organophosphorus insecticide residues were found in all urine samples, while the herbicide glyphosate was found in 53% of individuals. Food frequency questionnaires showed that residues from organophosphates were higher with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. A total of 34 associations between pesticide residue concentrations and faecal metabolite concentrations were detected. Glyphosate excretion was positively associated with an overall increased bacterial species richness, as well as to fatty acid metabolites and phosphate levels. The insecticide metabolite Br2CA, reflecting deltamethrin exposure, was positively associated with the phytoestrogens enterodiol and enterolactone, and negatively associated with some N-methyl amino acids. Urine metabolomics performed on a subset of samples did not reveal associations with the excretion of pesticide residues.ConclusionsThe consumption of conventionally grown fruit and vegetables leads to higher ingestion of pesticides with unknown long-term health consequences. Our results highlight the need for future dietary intervention studies to understand effects of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome and possible health consequences.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the following aspects: i) presence of activity-induced dental modifications (AIDMs) in a medieval population from Pieve di Pava (Siena, central Italy); ii) sex-specific and age-specific distribution of AIDMs in the sample; iii) potential correlations between AIDMs and the tradi tional activities and cultural habits of rural communities in medieval Italy.
DESIGN: The permanent teeth of 204 individuals buried at Pieve di Pava (10th-12th centuries AD) were systematically examined in order to assess the distribution of five types of AIDM, i.e. lingual surface attrition of the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT), excessive occlusal load, grooving, notching, and chipping.
RESULTS: Prevalence rates of LSAMAT, excessive occlusal load and grooving were low, whereas higher frequencies were recorded for the other types of AIDMs. Prevalence was higher in the male subsample for all the modifications recorded. Overall, the frequencies of AIDMs increased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: The very low prevalence of LSAMAT was thought to be connected to leatherworking in the sample under study, while excessive occlusal load was interpreted as evidence that hard materials requiring preliminary chewing and softening were not regularly processed with teeth. The unique case of interproximal grooving in an old male individual may reflect the use of a toothpick for therapeutic purpose. Conversely, the very high prevalence of notching and chipping was taken as indicative of the processing of wool fibers. The sex-specific distribution of these AIDMs suggests that males performed activities involving the use of teeth more frequently than females.},

 abstract = {The growth of plants, animals, and humans can give rise to layered structures
associated with annual periodicity. Thickness variations are often correlated
to nutrition supply and stress factors. The annual layers in a tree trunk with
millimeter thickness can be directly counted, whereas the layers in tooth
cementum with micrometer thickness are made visible using optical microscopy.
These optical techniques rely on the surface evaluation or thin, optically
transparent slices. Hard X-ray tomography with micrometer resolution, however,
provides a three-dimensional view without physical slicing. We have developed a
procedure to enhance the tomography data of annual layers in human and bovid
tooth cementum. The analysis of a substantial part of an archeological human
tooth demonstrated that the detected number of layers depended on the selected
region and could vary between 13 and 27. The related average thickness of the
annual layers was found to be (5.4 $\pm$ 1.9) $\mu$m for the human tooth,
whereas the buffalo tooth exhibited a layer periodicity of 46 $\mu$m. The
present study elucidates the potential of combining computational tools with
high-quality micro computed tomography data to quantify the annual layers in
tooth cementum for a variety of purposes including age-at-death determination.},

Databases including Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied-Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched in addition to reference lists from selected articles and other key references. A critical review of relevant articles from the data sources was conducted with attention to the infant feeding types and maternal night-time sleep. The methodological quality was assessed systematically. The pooled mean difference was calculated. Narrative summaries were also used. A total of 6,472 participants from seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects model demonstrated a significantly higher maternal night-time sleep in breastfeeding mothers than non-breastfeeding mothers with a pooled standardized mean difference of 0.24 h (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.46, p = 0.026). Co-sleeping with infants during the night also increased the sleeping hours in breastfeeding mothers. Homogeneity was observed with a Tau<sup>2</sup> of 0.0308 and I<sup>2</sup> of 44.3%. Funnel plots, Egger's and Begg's tests revealed no evidence of publication bias. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that breastfeeding may be associated with a longer night-time sleep postpartum and the synthesis of the literature suggested that co-sleeping with the infant was associated with longer sleep duration in breastfeeding women. Further research into factors involving maternal decisions on infant feeding types and their effects on maternal sleep is needed to better understand the mothers' attitude toward infant feeding and their own sleep.},

 abstract = {The burden of bacterial resistance to antibiotics affects several key sectors in the world, including healthcare, the government, and the economic sector. Resistant bacterial infection is associated with prolonged hospital stays, direct costs, and costs due to loss of productivity, which will cause policy makers to adjust their policies. Current widely performed procedures for the identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria rely on culture-based methodology. However, some resistance determinants, such as free-floating DNA of resistance genes, are outside the bacterial genome, which could be potentially transferred under antibiotic exposure. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to profiling antibiotic resistance offer several advantages to overcome the limitations of the culture-based approach. These methodologies enhance the probability of detecting resistance determinant genes inside and outside the bacterial genome and novel resistance genes yet pose inherent challenges in availability, validity, expert usability, and cost. Despite these challenges, such molecular-based and bioinformatics technologies offer an exquisite advantage in improving clinicians' diagnoses and the management of resistant infectious diseases in humans. This review provides a comprehensive overview of next-generation sequencing technologies, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics in assessing antimicrobial resistance profiles.},

 abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, is a relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract, presenting with chronic inflammation, ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Up to 80% of patients suffering from IBD experience acute pain, which dissipates when the underlying inflammation and tissue damage resolves. However, despite achieving endoscopic remission with no signs of ongoing intestinal inflammation or damage, 30-50% of IBD patients in remission experience chronic abdominal pain, suggesting altered sensory neuronal processing in this disorder. Furthermore, effective treatment for chronic pain is limited such that 5-25% of IBD outpatients are treated with narcotics, with associated morbidity and mortality. IBD patients commonly present with substantial alterations to the microbial community structure within the gastrointestinal tract, known as dysbiosis. The same is also true in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, in the absence of inflammation. An emerging body of literature suggests that the gut microbiome plays an important role in visceral hypersensitivity. Specific microbial metabolites have an intimate relationship with host receptors that are highly expressed on host cell and neurons, suggesting that microbial metabolites play a key role in visceral hypersensitivity. In this review, we will discuss the techniques used to analysis the metabolome, current potential metabolite targets for visceral hypersensitivity, and discuss the current literature that evaluates the role of the post-inflammatory microbiota and metabolites in visceral hypersensitivity.},

 abstract = {Archaeological and genomic evidence suggest that modern Homo sapiens have roamed the planet for some 300–500 thousand years. In contrast, global human mitochondrial (mtDNA) diversity coalesces to one African female ancestor (“Mitochondrial Eve”) some 145 thousand years ago, owing to the ¼ gene pool size of our matrilineally inherited haploid genome. Therefore, most of human prehistory was spent in Africa where early ancestors of Southern African Khoisan and Central African rainforest hunter-gatherers (RFHGs) segregated into smaller groups. Their subdivisions followed climatic oscillations, new modes of subsistence, local adaptations, and cultural-linguistic differences, all prior to their exodus out of Africa. Seven African mtDNA haplogroups (L0–L6) traditionally captured this ancient structure—these L haplogroups have formed the backbone of the mtDNA tree for nearly two decades. Here we describe L7, an eighth haplogroup that we estimate to be ~ 100 thousand years old and which has been previously misclassified in the literature. In addition, L7 has a phylogenetic sublineage L7a*, the oldest singleton branch in the human mtDNA tree (~ 80 thousand years). We found that L7 and its sister group L5 are both low-frequency relics centered around East Africa, but in different populations (L7: Sandawe; L5: Mbuti). Although three small subclades of African foragers hint at the population origins of L5'7, the majority of subclades are divided into Afro-Asiatic and eastern Bantu groups, indicative of more recent admixture. A regular re-estimation of the entire mtDNA haplotype tree is needed to ensure correct cladistic placement of new samples in the future.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Biogeographic variations in the gut microbiota reflect host and environmental factors delineating human populations, and are pivotal to understand global patterns of host-microbiota interactions in health and prevalent lifestyle-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Pakistani adults, having an exceptionally high prevalence of T2D, are one of the most understudied populations in microbiota research to date. The aim of the present study is to examine the gut microbiota across individuals from Pakistan and other populations of non-industrialized and industrialized lifestyles with a focus on T2D. The fecal samples from 94 urban-dwelling Pakistani adults with and without T2D were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, and plasma samples quantified for circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and the activation ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling. Publicly available datasets generated with comparable molecular methods were retrieved for comparative analysis. Overall, urbanized Pakistanis’ gut microbiota was similar to that of transitional or non-industrialized populations, depleted in Akkermansiaceae and enriched in Prevotellaceae (dominated by the non-Westernized clades of Prevotella copri ). The relatively high proportion of Atopobiaceae appeared to be a unique characteristic of the Pakistani gut microbiota. The Pakistanis with T2D had elevated levels of LBP and TLR-signaling in circulation as well as gut microbial signatures atypical of other populations e.g., increased relative abundance of Libanicoccus/Parolsenella , limiting the inter-population extrapolation of gut microbiota-based classifiers for T2D. Taken together, our findings call for more global representation of understudied populations to extend the applicability of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics. },

The gut microbiota is altered in multiple sclerosis patients and likely contributes to disease pathogenesis. Trans-anal irrigation has been proven to allow treatment of neurogenic bowel dysfunction and may affect gut microbiota.
Objectives: The primary outcome was trans-anal irrigation effectiveness on constipation and faecal incontinence. The secondary outcome was gut microbiota profiling compared to healthy subjects and during trans-anal irrigation adoption.
Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study on multiple sclerosis patients, screened with Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life questionnaire before undergoing constipation and faecal incontinence scoring, abdomen X-ray for intestinal transit time, compilation of food and evacuation diaries and faecal sample collection for gut microbiota analysis before and after 4 weeks of trans-anal irrigation.
Results and Conclusions: Eighty patients were screened of which nearly half had intestinal symptoms. The included population (n = 37) was predominantly composed of women with significantly longer disease duration, higher mean age and disability than the excluded one (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twelve patients completed the trans-anal irrigation phase, which led to significant improvement of bowel dysfunction symptom-related quality of life, increase in gut microbiota diversity and reduction of the proportions of pro-inflammatory taxa (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Trans-anal irrigation was safe, satisfactory and could help counteract multiple sclerosis-related dysbiosis.},

Moreover, antenatal practices among forager and agriculturalists have never been compared, despite subsistence mode being known to affect staple foods and lifestyle directly. This gap hinders to us from understanding the overall threats attributed to pregnancy, and their perceived nutritional causes around the world. The present study constitutes the first cross-cultural meta-analysis on food taboos during pregnancy. We examined thirty-two articles on dietary antenatal restrictions among agricultural and non-agricultural societies, in order to: (i) identify cross-culturally targeted animal, plant and miscellaneous foods; (ii) define major clusters of taboo focus; (iii) test the hypothesis that food types and clusters of focus distribute differently between agricultural and non-agricultural taboos; and (iv) test the hypothesis that food types distribute differently across the clusters of taboo focus. All data were analysed in SPSS and RStudio using chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact tests. We detected a gradient in taboo focus that ranged from no direct physiological interest to the fear of varied physiological complications to a very specific concern over increased birth weight and difficult delivery. Non-agricultural taboos were more likely to target non-domesticated animal foods and to be justified by concerns not directly linked to the physiological sphere, whereas agricultural taboos tended to targed more cultivated and processed products and showed a stronger association with concerns over increased birth weight. Despite some methodological discrepancies in the existing literature on food taboos during pregnancy, our results illustrate that such cultural traits are useful for detecting perception of biological pressures on reproduction across cultures. Indeed, the widespread concern over birth weight and carbohydrate rich foods overlaps with clinical evidence that obstructed labor is a major threat to maternal life in Africa, Asia and Eurasia. Furthermore, asymmetry in the frequency of such concern across subsistence modes aligns with the evolutionary perspective that agriculture may have exacerbated delivery complications. This study highlights the need for the improved understanding of dietary behaviors during pregnancy across the world, addressing the role of obstructed labor as a key point of convergence between clinical, evolutionary and cultural issues in human behavior.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary psychology aims to understand the origins of the human mind, including disease. Several theories about the origins of disease have been proposed. One concerns a developmental mismatch-a mismatch might occur at the individual level between the environment experienced during childhood and the environment the adult finds herself in, possibly resulting in disease. A second theory concerns the idea of an evolutionary mismatch-humans are adapted to ancestral conditions so they might now experience a mismatch with their modern environment, possibly resulting in disease. A third theory-differential susceptibility-outlines how genetic and epigenetic differences influence the extent to which humans are susceptible to rearing, including positive and negative experiences. Because of these differences, some individuals are more prone to develop disease than others. We review empirical studies that substantiate these theories and argue that an overarching theory that integrates these three lines into one provides a more accurate understanding of disease from an evolutionary perspective.},

This work aimed to develop efficient models for identifying essential physiological markers for improved T2D classification using machine learning algorithms. Using amplicon metagenomic approaches, an effort has also been made to understand the alterations in core gut microbial members in Indian T2D patients with respect to their control normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Our data indicate the level of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were the most useful physiological indicators while random forest and support vector machine with RBF Kernel were effective predictions models for identifications of T2D. The dominating gut microbial members <i>Allopreotella, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Haemophilus, Ruminococcus torques group</i>, etc. in Indian T2D patients showed a strong association with both FBG and HbA1c. These members have been reported to have a crucial role in gut barrier breakdown, blood glucose, and lipopolysaccharide level escalation, or as biomarkers. While the dominant NGT microbiota (<i>Akkermansia, Ligilactobacillus, Enterobacter</i>, etc.) in the colon has been shown to influence inflammatory immune responses by acting as an anti-inflammatory agent and maintaining the gut barrier. The topology study of co-occurrence network analysis indicates that changes in network complexity in T2D lead to variations in the different gut microbial members compared to NGT. These studies provide a better understanding of the gut microbial diversity in Indian T2D patients and show the way for the development of valuable diagnostics strategies to improve the prediction and modulation of the T2D along with already established methods.},

The growth and reproductive cycles of these organisms follow seasonal weather patterns, including changes in rainfall, light exposure and temperature. Food designers should consider such aspects of seasonality, as they affect the availability and quality of the ingredients that they work with. Moreover, seasonality brings unique possibilities and challenges that can inspire new and interesting solutions for culinary applications, food propositions and social events. In addition, seasonality can be a goal to aspire to, because it can provide benefits in the domains of sustainability, health and well-being. For these reasons, we propose that, instead of following the current trend of deseasonalization, food designers can contribute to reconcile our food systems with the seasons. This will provide an excellent opportunity for enabling more sustainable, meaningful and healthy rhythms of growing, processing, preparing and consuming food.},

 abstract = {Abstract Industrialization - including urbanization, participation in the global food chain, and consumption of heavily processed foods - is thought to drive substantial shifts in the human microbiome. While diet strongly influences stool microbiome composition, the influence of diet on the oral microbiome, and particularly dental plaque, is largely speculative. Here we investigated whether dental plaque microbial communities are distinctly different across populations with dissimilar subsistence strategies and degree of industrialized market integration. Using a metagenomic approach, we compared the dental plaque microbiomes of Baka foragers and Nzime subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon (n = 46) with the dental plaque and calculus microbiomes of highly industrialized populations in North America and Europe. We found that differences in microbial taxonomic composition between populations were minimal, with high conservation of abundant microbial taxa and no significant differences in microbial diversity related to dietary practices. Instead, we find that the major source of variation in dental plaque microbial species composition is related to tooth location and oxygen availability, and may be influenced by toothbrushing or other dental hygiene measures. Our results support that dental plaque, in contrast to the stool microbiome, maintains an inherent stability against ecological perturbations in the oral environment.},

The diminished consumption of nondigestible plant polysaccharides and the increase of fat and easily digestible carbohydrates have produced a progressive loss of certain fiber-fermenting species and a high prevalence of intestinal mucus-degrading species. In addition, diet and derived microbial metabolites have strong implications with the development of food-associated diseases such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, malnutrition and eating disorders, intestinal inflammatory diseases and colorectal cancer, among others. Moreover, recent epidemiological studies have associated the increased intake of highly processed foods and beverages, containing food additives and processing aids, with microbiota and intestinal alterations. In turn, healthy diets and specific nutritional interventions, including increase of dietary fiber, could be valuable for restoration of beneficial microbiota diversity capable of stimulating healthy states.},

In this Review, we explore microbial succession in the healthy human microbiota from the cradle to the grave. We discuss the stages from primary succession at birth, to disruptions by disease or antibiotic use, to microbial expansion at death. We address how these successions differ by body site and by domain (bacteria, fungi or viruses). We also review experimental tools that microbiota researchers use to conduct this work. Finally, we discuss future directions for studying the microbiota’s relationship with age, including designing consistent, well-powered, longitudinal studies, performing robust statistical analyses and improving characterization of non-bacterial microorganisms.},

We measured ecological knowledge at different ages in Pemba, Zanzibar (Tanzania), interviewing 93 children and teenagers between 4 and 26 years. We developed Bayesian latent-trait models to estimate individual knowledge and its association with age, activities, household family structure and education. In the studied population, children learn during the whole pre-reproductive period, but at varying rates, with the fastest increases in young children. Sex differences appear during middle childhood and are mediated by participation in different activities. In addition to providing a detailed empirical investigation of the relationship between knowledge acquisition and childhood, this study develops and documents computational improvements to the modelling of knowledge development.},

 abstract = {The infant gut microbiome has lifelong implications on health and immunity but there is still limited understanding of the microbiome differences and similarities between children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) vs. high-income countries (HICs). Here, we describe and compare the microbiome profile of children aged under 48 months in two urban areas: Maputo, Mozambique and Atlanta, USA using shotgun metagenomics. The gut microbiome of American children showed distinct development, characterized by higher alpha diversity after infancy, compared to the same age group of African children, and the microbiomes clustered separately based on geographic location or age. The abundances of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) were significantly higher in Maputo children, driven primarily by several primary and opportunistic pathogens. Most notably, about 50% of Maputo children under the age of two were positive for enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and typical enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli diagnostic genes while none of the Atlanta age-matched children showed such a positive signal. In contrast, commensal species such as Phocaeicola vulgatus and Bacteroides caccae were more abundant in Atlanta, potentially reflecting diets rich in animal protein and susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. Overall, our results suggest that the different environments characterizing the two cities have significant, distinctive signatures on the microbiota of children and its development over time. Lack of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions and/or unsafe food sources may explain the higher enteric pathogen load among children in Maputo.},

The diverse microbiota living throughout the human body is made up of thousands of microbial taxa from all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Microbial load and functional potency in different body sites are well distinct and have minimal resemblance at higher taxonomic levels between the two habitats. The highest microbial load, diversity, and functional potency including biosynthesis of essential nutrients, chemical modifications of dietary components, and sources of immunomodulatory molecules, are found in the gut microbiome. However, the inter-individual diversity and dynamics of the human microbiome in a given body habitat vary greatly over time. Both environmental factors and host genetics contribute significantly to shaping microbial community structure and its stability. A basic understanding of native microbial compositions and their functional potency and stability in different parts of healthy humans living across geography will help us to identify disease-specific microbiota and develop potential microbiome-based therapeutics.

For instance, microbiome studies that strictly control for diet across ethnically diverse populations are lacking. Here, we performed multiomic profiling over a 9-day period that included a 4-day controlled vegetarian diet intervention in a defined geographic location across 36 healthy Black and White females of similar age, weight, habitual diets, and health status. We demonstrate that individuality and ethnicity account for roughly 70% to 88% and 2% to 10% of taxonomic variation, respectively, eclipsing the effects a short-term diet intervention in shaping gut and oral microbiomes and gut viromes. Persistent variation between ethnicities occurs for microbial and viral taxa and various metagenomic functions, including several gut KEGG orthologs, oral carbohydrate active enzyme categories, cluster of orthologous groups of proteins, and antibiotic-resistant gene categories. In contrast to the gut and oral microbiome data, the urine and plasma metabolites tend to decouple from ethnicity and more strongly associate with diet. These longitudinal, multiomic profiles paired with a dietary intervention illuminate previously unrecognized associations of ethnicity with metagenomic and viromic features across body sites and cohorts within a single geographic location, highlighting the importance of accounting for human microbiome variation in research, health determinants, and eventual therapies.

Here, we evaluated the health effects of clarified apple juices (CAJs, devoid of pectin and additives) processed to different degrees, including not-from-concentrate (NFC) and from-concentrate (FC) CAJs. A 56-day experiment including a juice-switch after 28 days was designed. An integrated analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics of cecal content were performed. In addition, differences in the CAJs tested with respect to nutritional indices and composition of small-molecule compounds were analyzed. The NFC CAJ, which showed a higher phenolic content resulting from the lower processing degree, could improve microbiota diversity and influence its structure. It also reduced bile acid and bilirubin contents, as well as inhibited the microbial metabolism of tryptophan in the gut. However, we found that these effects diminished with time by performing experiment extension and undertaking juice-switching. Our study provides evidence regarding the health effects of processed foods that can potentially be applied to public health policy decision making. We believe that NFC juices with a lower processing degree could potentially be healthier than FC juice.},

 abstract = {Prevotella copri , the most abundant Prevotella species in the human gut also associated with habitual diet, represents one of the clearest cases of dissimilar associations with either health or disease. This chapter summarizes the recent knowledge about P. copri and the potential of this bacterium as a valuable member of the healthy human microbiome. Prevotella copri DSM 18205 is the only commercially available type strain that has been the gold standard for all P. copribased research. Gut microbiota composition is known to vary greatly between healthy individuals. The Prevotella ‐dominated microbiomes have been shown to occur in populations consuming agrarian fiber‐rich diets, such as indigenous populations in Africa and South America. P. copri strains associated with omnivore diets had a higher functional capacity for branched‐chain amino acid biosynthesis.},

 abstract = {The ultimate payoff of behaviours depends not only on their direct impact on an individual, but also on the impact on their relatives. Local relatedness—the average relatedness of an individual to their social environment—therefore has profound effects on social and life history evolution. Recent work has begun to show that local relatedness has the potential to change systematically over an individual’s lifetime, a process called kinship dynamics. However, it is unclear how general these kinship dynamics are, whether they are predictable in real systems and their effects on behaviour and life history evolution. In this study, we combine modelling with data from real systems to explore the extent and impact of kinship dynamics. We use data from seven group-living mammals with diverse social and mating systems to demonstrate not only that kinship dynamics occur in animal systems, but also that the direction and magnitude of kinship dynamics can be accurately predicted using a simple model. We use a theoretical model to demonstrate that kinship dynamics can profoundly affect lifetime patterns of behaviour and can drive sex differences in helping and harming behaviour across the lifespan in social species. Taken together, this work demonstrates that kinship dynamics are likely to be a fundamental dimension of social evolution, especially when considering age-linked changes and sex differences in behaviour and life history.},

 abstract = {Scholarly debates about the nature of human emotion traditionally pit biological and cultural influences against one another. Although many existing theories acknowledge the role of culture, they mostly treat emotion categories such as ‘anger’ as biological products. In this Perspective, we summarize traditional assumptions about the roles of biology and culture in emotion alongside supporting and conflicting empirical evidence. Building on constructionist models of emotion, we introduce a cultural evolutionary perspective that moves beyond a strict biology-versus-culture dichotomy. This cultural evolutionary perspective uses dual inheritance models of cultural transmission to explain how variation in emotion can arise across groups, how affect-laden information can travel throughout populations, and why people in different cultures use both similar and different emotion concepts and non-verbal expressions. This cultural evolution framework allows for new hypotheses about the development of emotion categories and challenges longstanding claims about the universality of emotion.},

 abstract = {Point-of-care testing (POCT) allows researchers and health-care providers to bring the lab bench to the field, providing essential health information that can be leveraged to improve health care, accessibility, and understanding across clinical and research settings. Gaps in health service access are most pronounced in what we term RIR settings-rural/remote regions, involving Indigenous peoples, and/or within resource-limited settings. In these contexts, morbidity and mortality from infectious and non-communicable diseases are disproportionately higher due to numerous geographic, economic, political, and sociohistorical factors. Human biologists and global health scholars are well-positioned to contribute on-the-ground-level insights that can serve to minimize global health inequities and POCT has the potential to augment such approaches. While the clinical benefits of POCT include increasing health service access by bringing testing, rapid diagnosis, and treatment to underserved communities with limited pathways to centralized laboratory testing, POCT also provides added benefits to both health-focused researchers and their participants. Through portable, minimally invasive devices, researchers can provide actionable health data to participants by coupling POCT with population-specific health education, discussing results and their implications, creating space for participants to voice concerns, and facilitating linkages to treatment. POCT can also strengthen human biology research by shedding light on questions of evolutionary and biocultural importance. Here, we expand on the epidemiological and research value, as well as practical and ethical challenges of POCT across stakeholders (i.e., participant, community, health researcher, and trainee). Finally, we emphasize the immense opportunities of POCT for fostering collaborative research and enhancing access to health delivery and information and, by extension, helping to mitigate persistent global health inequities.},

 abstract = {The archeology of the Puna, a high elevation desert in South America, gives us a long-term perspective on the role of wild plants in people’s diets during the Holocene. We explore the impact of aridification on the use of edible wild plants among desert people through the study of macrobotanical remains. Our goal is to examine the variation in plant dependency and risk management strategies used over time, in particular during the drought of the Middle Holocene (ca. 8700–4500 BP). The macrobotanical record suggests the use of risk-averse strategies in order to cope with unpredictable resource productivity. Hunter-gatherers relied on carbohydrate rich resources from the vega wetlands and tolar shrublands, such as roots and tubers, as well as low-ranked seeds, stems, leaves, and fruits. They also obtained non-local edible plants by strengthening ties and forming safety nets with groups living in different ecozones that were not subject to the same resource fluctuation. Social interaction with areas lying beyond the ecological boundaries of the Puna has a longstanding tradition in this area beginning in the Early Holocene, and was likely a means of providing food security to populations whose subsistence depended mainly on camelid hunting, and eventually camelid pastoralism. A notable increase in that interaction began during the Late-Holocene, which was a period of lesser aridity, with the introduction of corn and quinoa.},

 abstract = {Objectives: Although xenobiotics derived from food processing may cause modifications in the composition of the gut microbiota (GM) evidence is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of potential dietary carcinogens as heterocyclic amines (HAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrates, nitrites, nitroso compounds and acrylamide, in combination to fibers (poly)phenols on the GM composition in a group of materially deprived subjects.
Study design: Transversal observational study in a sample of 19 subjects recipients of Red Cross food aid. Dietary information was recorded by means of 3 non-consecutive 24 h recalls. Questions focused on the type of cooking and the extent of cooking and roasting were included. Information on potential carcinogens was mainly obtained from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and Computerized Heterocyclic Amines Resource for Research in Epidemiology of Disease (CHARRED) Carcinogen Databases. Microbial composition was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in fecal samples.
Results: Higher levels of Lachnospiraceae and Eggerthellaceae families were found in individuals consuming less than 50 ng/day of 2-amino-3,8 dimethylimidazo (4,5,f) quinoxaline (MeIQx) (considered as lower risk dose for colorectal adenoma) while those consuming more than 40 ng/day of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo (4,5,b) pyridine (PhIP) (higher risk for colorectal adenoma) showed lower relative abundance of Muribaculaceae and greater presence of Streptococcaceae and <i>Eubacterium coprostanoligenes</i> group.
Conclusion: The associations identified between diet and processing by-products on GM in this study could be used as potential targets for the designing of dietary interventions tailored to this collective.},

Researchers studying the development of foraging proficiency have focused on assessing this hypothesis, yet studies present inconsistent conclusions regarding the connection between foraging skill development and niche complexity. Here, we leverage published records of child and adolescent foragers from 28 societies to (i) quantify how skill-intensive different resources are and (ii) assess whether children's proficiency increases more slowly for more skill-intensive resources. We find that foraging returns increase slowly for more skill-intensive, difficult-to-extract resources (tubers and game), consistent with peak productivity attained in adulthood. Foraging returns for easier-to-extract resources (fruit and fish/shellfish) increase rapidly during childhood, with adult levels of productivity reached by adolescence. Our findings support the view that long childhoods evolved as an extended period for learning to extract complex resources characteristic of the human foraging niche.},

Human biologists are central players in biomarker methods development, pioneering the creation of "field friendly," minimally invasively collected biomarker approaches, as well as leading the innovative use of biomarkers, most notably to map the complex pathways from social and environmental conditions to altered physiology to health effects. This special issue, Part 2 of a collection focused on minimally invasively collected biomarkers, is comprised of nine papers that jointly contribute to driving the science of biomarker methods development and application. This compilation of papers engages with topics such as biological normalcy, ecoimmunology, and the ethics of working with vulnerable and underserved populations. It also focuses attention on research areas at present not emphasized in human biology such as bone turnover markers as a window onto osteoporosis and osteoarthritis and the use of cancer-related biomarkers in population screening and epidemiology. Taken together, these papers help draw the roadmap for future biomarker work, emphasizing: (1) the need for systematic and transparent approaches to assay validation, with open access publication; (2) simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarkers and expanded use of instrument platforms that increase the range of physiological, genomics, and omics markers available to researchers; and, (3) increased attention to ethics and researcher responsibilities, encouraging a mindset that recognizes our obligation to provide benefits to individuals and communities and to help redress past abuses.},

 abstract = {Climate change and food security are highly interlinked challenges currently faced by human societies. Food and nutrition insecurity has increased due to a greater sensitivity to shifting climatic conditions and obsolete food production and processing methods. To face such challenges, climate-smart agriculture can be referred to as an approach that aims to promote sustainable agriculture and ensure food security. In Pakistan, the extent and direction of climate change impacts on food production have been recorded. This phenomenon has negatively impacted both agriculture and wild edible crops, thus threatening the food security of the country. Nature, on the other hand, has endowed Pakistan with a rich diversity of edible wild fruits (EWFs), which are used by most food-insecure countries. EWFs usually grow in the country’s tropical, subtropical, temperate, and alpine forests, plains, and deserts to suitably address the dual intervened issue. This chapter attempts to screen the nutritional and antioxidant potential of four underutilized EWFs of family Rosaceae, with a special emphasis on their mineral diversity, proximate composition, bioactive compounds, free radical scavenging activity using various assays and analytical methods to study minerals. The findings show that the Rosaceous WEFs are precious natural source of antioxidant/nutraceuticals as supplementing dietary foods. These fruits are not only a food supplement but also an important part of food and nutritional security, as well as a viable alternative for the long-term survival. A variety of techniques that may be used to analyze and cope with the negative effects of climate change has been presented.},

There is extensive search to understand the human microbiome, its metabolites, its action on the host, and the importance of the complexity of these relationships in health and disease. Thus, advances in high-throughput sequencing methods have paved the way for decoding bacterial genomes from different parts of the human body, a fundamental basis for microbiome analysis.

Pakistani adults, having an exceptionally high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), are one of the most understudied populations in microbiota research to date. The aim of the present study is to examine the gut microbiota across individuals from Pakistan and other populations of non-industrialized and industrialized lifestyles with a focus on T2D. The fecal samples from 94 urban-dwelling Pakistani adults with and without T2D were profiled by bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplicon sequencing and eubacterial qPCR, and plasma samples quantified for circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and the activation ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling. Publicly available datasets generated with comparable molecular methods were retrieved for comparative analysis of the bacterial microbiota. Overall, urbanized Pakistanis' gut microbiota was similar to that of transitional or non-industrialized populations, depleted in <i>Akkermansiaceae</i> and enriched in <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (dominated by the non-Westernized clades of <i>Prevotella copri</i>). The relatively high proportion of <i>Atopobiaceae</i> appeared to be a unique characteristic of the Pakistani gut microbiota. The Pakistanis with T2D had elevated levels of LBP and TLR-signaling in circulation as well as gut microbial signatures atypical of other populations, e.g., increased relative abundance of <i>Libanicoccus</i>/<i>Parolsenella</i>, limiting the inter-population extrapolation of gut microbiota-based classifiers for T2D. Taken together, our findings call for a more global representation of understudied populations to extend the applicability of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT  Introduction Despite clear linkages between provision of clean water and improvements in child health, limited information exists about the health impacts of large water infrastructure improvements in low-income settings. Billions of dollars are spent annually to improve urban water supply, and rigorous evaluation of these improvements, especially targeting informal settlements, is critical to guide policy and investment strategies. Objective measures of infection and exposure to pathogens, and measures of gut function, are needed to understand the effectiveness and impact of water supply improvements.   Methods and analysis In the PAASIM study, we examine the impact of water system improvements on acute and chronic health outcomes in children in a low-income urban area of Beira, Mozambique, comprising 62 sub-neighborhoods and ∼26,300 households. This prospective matched cohort study follows 548 mother-child dyads from late pregnancy through 12 months of age. Primary outcomes include measures of enteric pathogen infections, gut microbiome composition, and source drinking water microbiological quality, measured at the child’s 12 month visit. Additional outcomes include diarrhea prevalence, child growth, previous enteric pathogen exposure, child mortality, and various measures of water access and quality. Our analyses will compare a) subjects living in sub-neighborhoods with the improved water to those living in sub-neighborhoods without these improvements; and b) subjects with household water connections on their premises to those without such a connection. This study will provide critical information to understand how to optimize investments for improving child health, filling the information gap about the impact of piped water provision to low-income urban households, using novel gastrointestinal disease outcomes.   Ethics and dissemination  The study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board and the National Bio-Ethics Committee for Health in Mozambique. The pre-analysis is published on the Open Science Framework platform ( https://osf.io/4rkn6/ ). Results will be shared with relevant stakeholders locally, and through publications.    STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY   This matched cohort study of an urban water supply improvement project will provide critical information about the health impacts of providing piped water and household connections to low-income households.   We employ rigorous measures of exposure and novel and objective outcome measures, including gut microbiome composition and molecular detection of enteric pathogens.   The study design allows for examination of both neighborhood and household-level effects of water supply improvements.   As a natural experiment, we are unable to randomize the intervention, leading to potential residual confounding.   We are unable to examine the impacts of all aspects of the city-wide water improvement project, due to lack of comparable populations, and instead focus only on the low income neighborhoods.   },

 abstract = {Indians who migrate to westernized countries such as Canada, the USA, and the UK are at an increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While the underlying aetiology of IBD remains unclear, a gut microbiome, i.e. no longer symbiotic with its host, is a major player. Increasing IBD incidence in Indian immigrants may be due to the adoption of western practices that result in loss of tolerance of a symbiotic community in the gut and its underlying immune responses. However, little is known about the microbial changes in the Indian gut, including shifts in the microbiome when they migrate to westernized countries. In this Current Opinion, we discuss what is known about the Indian gut microbiome and how living in a westernized environment may be impeding what was once a symbiotic relationship with their gut microbiome and intestinal mucosae, which may be the driving factor in their increased risk of IBD.},

Unlike regular green tea, Matcha green tea is believed to exert beneficial effects on the gut microbiota, as it is richer in nutrients such as tea catechins and insoluble dietary fiber. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of consumption of Matcha green tea on the gut microbiota. Human participants were randomly assigned to a placebo (<i>n</i> = 16) or a Matcha green tea (<i>n</i> = 17) drink group and asked to drink the treatments for two weeks. Feces were collected from the participants pre- and post-treatment and fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. The beta-diversity of microbial composition significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) changed in MGT group but not in placebo group. In addition, the number of unique bacterial genera significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) changed in the Matcha green tea group was 30, while it was only 3 in the Placebo group. Increase and decrease in abundances of <i>Coprococcus</i> and <i>Fusobacterium</i>, respectively, in the gut microbiota of Matcha green tea group, conferred potential health benefits to the host. The present study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000043857).},

 abstract = {The metabolome is a central determinant of human phenotypes and includes the plethora of small molecules produced by host and microbiome or taken up from exogenous sources. However, studies of the metabolome have so far focused predominantly on urban, industrialized populations. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis of 90 fecal samples from human individuals from Africa and the Americas-the birthplace and the last continental expansion of our species, respectively-we characterized a shared human fecal metabolome. The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features such as amino acid-conjugated bile acids and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Additionally, coanalyses with over 5,000 publicly available human fecal samples and cooccurrence probability analyses with the gut microbiome highlight connections between the human fecal metabolome and gut microbiome. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a shared human fecal metabolome. This study represents the first characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome through untargeted analyses of populations along an industrialization gradient. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> As the world becomes increasingly industrialized, understanding the biological consequences of these lifestyle shifts and what it means for past, present, and future human health is critical. Indeed, industrialization is associated with rises in allergic and autoimmune health conditions and reduced microbial diversity. Exploring these health effects on a chemical level requires consideration of human lifestyle diversity, but understanding the significance of any differences also requires knowledge of what molecular components are shared between human groups. Our study reveals the key chemistry of the human gut as defined by varied industrialization-based differences and ubiquitous shared features. Ultimately, these novel findings extend our knowledge of human molecular biology, especially as it is influenced by lifestyle and behavior, and provide steps toward understanding how human biology has changed over our species' history.},

 abstract = {Club-rush (Bolboschoenus spp. (Asch.) Palla) is one of the most common edible wild plant taxa found at Epipaleolithic and Neolithic sites in southwest Asia. At the Early Natufian site of Shubayqa 1 (Black Desert, Jordan) thousands of club-rush rhizome-tuber remains and hundreds of fragments of prepared meals were found. The evidence indicated that the underground storage organs of this plant were recurrently used as a source of food 14,600 years ago. To determine how Early Natufian communities gathered, processed and transformed club-rush tubers into food, we designed an interdisciplinary study that combined experimental archaeology, archaeobotany, and ground and chipped stone tool analyses. We conducted more than 50 specific experiments over three years, and based on the experimental materials produced we inferred that 1) the best season for club-rush rhizome-tuber collection in the region was spring-summer time; 2) that the primary method to harvest the plant would have been uprooting; and 3) that the most efficient approaches to obtain perfectly peeled and clean rhizome-tubers could have entailed drying, roasting and gentle grinding of the tubers. Overall, our work provides important information to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire for club-rush tuber exploitation in the past. The experimental data and modern reference datasets allow us to interpret the archaeological material found at Shubayqa 1, and start identifying some of the activities that Natufian communities in the Black Desert undertook in relation to the exploitation of this particular source of food.},

 abstract = {Increasingly, for-profit firms commit to creating value for stakeholders. But what are the consequences of mixing stakeholder value and profit? In this article, we draw on insights into moral psychology to explain that a firm's commitments to stakeholder value and to profit both influence individual stakeholders' cooperation, albeit in opposite directions. We predict that mixed firms – committed to both stakeholder value and profit – are perceived as less other-regarding, and, therefore, elicit less cooperation, than stakeholder-oriented firms – balancing the interests of a broad range of stakeholders. In two series of vignette experiments, we find that this is the case for mixed firms switching between profit and stakeholder value, and for mixed firms simultaneously increasing profit and stakeholder value. By investigating mixed firms, this article expands the descriptive scope of stakeholder theory. By applying knowledge from moral psychology, and experimental methods, this work advances the micro-foundations of stakeholder theory.},

 abstract = {How climate change is uniquely affecting Indigenous health remains a very less explored area in the existing research literature. The imperative of inclusive climate action to protect indigenous health multiplies manifolds due to their unique vulnerabilities owing to predominant dependence on natural resources and multiple disadvantages faced. The current article attempted to add to the evidence pool regarding climate change impacts on the indigenous population by systematically collecting, processing, and interpreting data as a scoping literature review for effective and inclusive climate policymaking. Twenty-Nine articles of varied study designs were identified employing a systematically organized search strategy using PubMed (Field, MeSH, and advanced search) and Google scholar; relevant data were extracted for further analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Changing climate scenarios had both direct and indirect health-related impacts on indigenous health, and altered the epidemiological triad for various health-related events, causing the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases and mental disorders. An expanded framework was developed showcasing the variability of climate change events, multiple disadvantages, and its impacts on indigenous populations. Few studies also reported a wide range of adaptation responses of indigenous peoples towards climate change. It was substantiated that any climate-change mitigation policy must take into account the trials and tribulations of indigenous communities. Also, due to the complexity and large variability of the impacts and differences in mitigation capabilities, policies should be contextualized locally and tailored to meet the climate need of the indigenous community.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Current evidence suggests that chemical exposure alters gut microbiota composition, with higher exposure to environmental chemicals being associated with reduced microbiome diversity. However, not much is known about the impact of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on gut bacteria. Here we set out to identify the gut bacterial species that associate with chemical exposure before (maternal) and after (maternal, infant) birth in a mother-infant series. Paired blood and stool samples were collected from mother-infant dyads (n = 30) in a longitudinal setting. PFAS were quantified in maternal blood to examine their associations with the microbial compositions (determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing) in mothers and infants. High maternal exposure to PFAS was persistently associated with increased abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii in maternal stool. Among individual PFAS compounds, PFOS and PFHpS showed the strongest connection with M. smithii . However, maternal PFAS exposure associated only weakly with the infant microbiome. Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure contributes to the modulation of the adult gut microbiome composition. },

Using shotgun metagenomics, we explored the taxonomic and functional structure of the gut microbiome from 275 Nunavik Inuit ranging from 16 to 30-year-old. Whole-metagenome analyses revealed that Nunavik Inuit youths have a more diverse microbiome than their non-industrialized and industrialized counterparts. A comparison of k-mer content illustrated the uniqueness of the Nunavik gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids producing species, and carbohydrates degradation pathways dominated Inuit metagenomes.

 abstract = {Purpose: Obesity is currently a major global public health issue. It has been shown by many that gut microbiota and microbial factors regulate the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic abnormalities, but little is known about their roles in the different degrees of obesity. Here, we sought to investigate the microbial signatures of obesity of various severities.
Patients and Methods: We did this by characterizing the intestinal microbiome signature in a Chinese cohort of obese patients and healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To this end, obesity was sub-divided into four subgroups, including "Overweight", Class I, Class II, and Class III obesity, based on body mass index (BMI).
Results: Microbial diversity decreased in obese subjects, and the reduction trend was correlated with the severity of obesity. We detected an expansion of <i>Escherichia shigella</i> in obese patients compared to healthy controls. The family Eubacterium coprostanoligenes and Tannerellaceae, the genera <i>Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i>, and the species <i>Prevotella copri</i> were microbial biomarkers of healthy people. Gammaproteobacteria and Enterobacterales were biomarkers of being "Overweight". Erysipelatoclostridiaceae was a biomarker of Class I obesity. The class Bacilli and the order Lactobacillales were both biomarkers of Class II obesity. Negativicutes was a biomarker of Class III obesity. We further established relationships between this microbiome data and other biochemical data, including albumin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), vitamin folic acid (FA) and vitamin B12 (VB12), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Function prediction results showed a marked energy metabolism dysbiosis in obesity, especially in patients with Class III obesity.
Conclusion: These results suggested that people with different levels of obesity had distinct gut microbial signatures. Decreased microbial diversity, depletion of some specific taxa, and deviation in potential functions mirrored the severity of obesity in this cohort.},

 abstract = {Recent studies provide mixed results regarding whether the perception of facial attractiveness is increased or decreased by partial occlusion with a sanitary mask. One set of studies demonstrated that occluding the bottom half of a face increased facial attractiveness. This effect is thought to occur because the occluded area is interpolated by an average facial representation that is perceived as attractive. However, several groups of studies showed that partial occlusion can increase or decrease perceived attractiveness depending on the attractiveness of the original (unoccluded) face, due to regression to the mean. To reconcile this inconsistency, we propose that the occluded area is interpolated not by an average facial representation, but by a template of moderate attractiveness, shaped by the distribution of each viewer's experience. This hypothesis predicts an interaction between occlusion and the attractiveness of the original face so that occluded attractive faces are rated as less attractive, while occluded unattractive faces are rated as more attractive. To examine this hypothesis, the present study used attractiveness-rating tasks with mask-free versus masked faces in own-race and other-races categories. Viewers were familiar with own-race faces and unfamiliar with other-races faces. If moderate-attractiveness interpolation were the explanatory factor, the interaction between the occlusion and the attractiveness of the original face should be found only in the rating of own-race faces. Consistent with this hypothesis, the interaction between the occlusion and the attractiveness of the original faces was significant only for the own-race faces. Specifically, wearing a sanitary mask decreased the facial attractiveness of attractive faces in the own-race, while it increased the attractiveness regardless of the level of facial attractiveness in other-races. These findings suggest that the occluded area of own-race faces is interpolated by a facial template of moderate attractiveness. The other-races template could be developed using familiar exemplars such as celebrities. Thus, interpolation by such a template should result in elevated attractiveness relative to that by an own-race template. Accordingly, the apparent inconsistency in the literature regarding the effect of partial occlusion on physical attractiveness can be explained in terms of differences in the template involving interpolation of the occluded area.},

The contributors show that by turning organic substance into food, acts of eating create interconnected food webs organized by relative conditions of edibility through which eaters may in turn become eaten. In case studies ranging from nineteenth- and twentieth-century industrial animal husbandry in the United States, biodynamic winemaking in Aotearoa New Zealand, and reindeer herding in Arctic Norway to the creation of taste sensation in pet food and the entanglement of sugar and diabetes in the Caribbean, the contributors explore how food and eating create thresholds for human and nonhuman relations. These thresholds mediate different conditions and states of being: between living and dying, between the edible and the inedible, and the relationship between living organisms and their surrounding environment. In this way, acts of eating and the process of metabolism partake in the making and unmaking of multispecies ontologies, taxonomies, and ecologies.

We test three hypotheses derived from this principle with data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and find little support for the theory. Rather, findings suggest exactly the opposite of that predicted: As social distance between offender and victim increases, the odds of victim injury decreases.

 abstract = {Innate effector cells are immune cells endowed with host protective features and cytotoxic functions. By sensing the tissue environment, innate cells have an important role in regulating the transition from homeostasis to inflammation and the establishment of pathological states, including the onset and development of cancer. The tumor microenvironment induces molecular and functional modifications in innate cells, dampening their capability to initiate and sustain anti-tumor immune responses. Emerging studies clearly showed a contribution of the microbiota in modulating the functions of innate cells in cancer. Commensal microorganisms can not only directly interact with innate cells in the tumor microenvironment but can also exert immunomodulatory features from non-tumor sites through the release of microbial products. The microbiota can mediate the priming of innate cells at mucosal tissues and determine the strength of immune responses mediated by such cells when they migrate to non-mucosal tissues, having an impact on cancer. Finally, several evidences reported a strong contribution of the microbiota in promoting innate immune responses during anti-cancer therapies leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we considered the current knowledge on the role of the microbiota in shaping host innate immune responses in cancer.},

 abstract = {The late 1960s and the 1970s saw palaeodemography emerge as a new field, with preliminary methods, applications and issues developed and noted by a number of archaeologists, biological anthropologists, and demographers. Palaeodemography is the study of the dynamics of past populations, typically those that lack historical census data. This chapter explores how demographic theory and methods have been integrated into palaeodemography within the context of archaeology. It discusses the manner in which theory has influenced palaeodemography, including the amalgamation of theoretical concepts into palaeodemographic methods and the interpretive framework in which analyses are contextualized. The chapter discusses at length the development of methods in palaeodemography and how these have evolved over time and responded to criticisms from within and outside the field. Palaeodemographic methods were originally derived from demographic approaches but have evolved to meet the requirements and challenges of working with bioarchaeological data.},

 abstract = {Abstract The populations of the Angolan Namib Desert have been largely neglected in previous surveys of the genomic landscape of southern Africa. Although at present the Namib is culturally dominated by Southwest Bantu-speaking cattle-herders, the region exhibits an extraordinary ethnographic diversity which includes an array of semi-nomadic peoples whose subsistence strategies fall outside the traditional division between foraging and food production and can thus be referred to as “peripatetic”. Among these small-scale populations are the last speakers of the Kwadi branch of the Khoe-Kwadi language family associated with the introduction of pastoralism into southern Africa (Kwepe), as well as a range of groups whose origins remain enigmatic (Kwisi, Twa and Tjimba). Using genome-wide data from 208 individuals belonging to nine ethnically diverse groups from the Angolan Namib and adjacent areas (Kwepe, Kwisi, Twa, Tjimba, !Xun, Kuvale, Himba, Nyaneka, Ovimbundu) in combination with published data from other regions of Africa, we reconstruct in detail the histories of contact emerging from pre-historic migrations to southern Africa and show that peripatetic groups from southwestern Angola stand out for exhibiting elevated levels of an unique, regionally-specific and highly divergent Pre-Bantu ancestry. These findings highlight the importance of the Namib for understanding the deep genetic structure of Africa.},

 abstract = {Breastfeeding and weaning are actively studied from evolutionary, medical, and social research perspectives because of their close association with infant mortality, lifetime health, and human population dynamics. Each discipline benefits from an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge regarding the bases, processes, and consequences of these phenomena. However, current social issues related to breastfeeding and weaning have received little attention from an evolutionary biology perspective. We address this gap by reviewing current social issues related to human breastfeeding and weaning in an evolutionary framework. This approach helps build a conceptual framework with the goal of better understanding ultimate causes of or influences on these current social issues. The six social issues reviewed here fall into three categories: the spatiotemporal constraints of breastfeeding, abuse of breast milk as valuable material, and mismatch in breastfeeding practices. Some of these issues have an evolutionary basis. We analyze the structure of these social issues and discuss their possible solutions in terms of extension of the trade-off theory in evolutionary biology. Our discussion on the current social issues in breastfeeding and weaning highlights the effectiveness of an approach rooted in evolutionary theory and biological anthropology.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite clear linkages between provision of clean water and improvements in child health, limited information exists about the health impacts of large water infrastructure improvements in low-income settings. Billions of dollars are spent annually to improve urban water supply, and rigorous evaluation of these improvements, especially targeting informal settlements, is critical to guide policy and investment strategies. Objective measures of infection and exposure to pathogens, and measures of gut function, are needed to understand the effectiveness and impact of water supply improvements.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In the PAASIM study, we examine the impact of water system improvements on acute and chronic health outcomes in children in a low-income urban area of Beira, Mozambique, comprising 62 sub-neighbourhoods and ~26 300 households. This prospective matched cohort study follows 548 mother-child dyads from late pregnancy through 12 months of age. Primary outcomes include measures of enteric pathogen infections, gut microbiome composition and source drinking water microbiological quality, measured at the child's 12-month visit. Additional outcomes include diarrhoea prevalence, child growth, previous enteric pathogen exposure, child mortality and various measures of water access and quality. Our analyses will compare (1) subjects living in sub-neighbourhoods with the improved water to those living in sub-neighbourhoods without these improvements; and (2) subjects with household water connections on their premises to those without such a connection. This study will provide critical information to understand how to optimise investments for improving child health, filling the information gap about the impact of piped water provision to low-income urban households, using novel gastrointestinal disease outcomes.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board and the National Bio-Ethics Committee for Health in Mozambique. The pre-analysis plan is published on the Open Science Framework platform (https://osf.io/4rkn6/). Results will be shared with relevant stakeholders locally, and through publications.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As part of the human reproductive strategy, mothers receive childcare assistance from others. For kin, allomothers are adaptively incentivized to provide assistance due to inclusive fitness benefits. Previous studies across a broad range of populations identify grandmothers as particularly consistent allomothers. Minimal attention has been paid to the possibility that allomothers may begin investing in offspring quality during the prenatal stage of life. Here, we innovate within the area of grandmother allocare research by examining the prenatal stage of life and biopsychosocial mechanisms by which prenatal grandmother effects may be enacted.
METHODS: Data derive from the Mothers' Cultural Experiences study, a cohort of 107 pregnant Latina women in Southern California. At <16 weeks' gestation, we administered questionnaires, collected morning urine samples, and measured cortisol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, correcting for specific gravity. We measured the soon-to-be maternal and paternal grandmothers' relationship quality, social support, frequency of seeing each other, communicating, and geographic proximity to pregnant mothers, that is, their daughters and daughters-in-law. These measures were self-reported by the pregnant mothers. We assessed how grandmother constructs related to the pregnant women's depression, stress, anxiety, and cortisol levels.
RESULTS: We observed benefits conferred by maternal grandmothers for mothers' prenatal mental health and lower cortisol levels. Paternal grandmothers also conferred mental health benefits to pregnant daughters-in-law, but higher cortisol levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that grandmothers, especially maternal grandmothers, are able to improve their inclusive fitness by caring for pregnant daughters, and allomother support may positively impact prenatal health. This work extends the traditional cooperative breeding model by identifying a prenatal grandmother effect, and, by examining a maternal biomarker.},

 abstract = {Diet is currently considered one of the most important adjustable determinants of human health. The gut microbiota, the collection of microorganisms that inhabit (mainly) the distal bowel, has recently been shown to ensure critical physiological functions, such as immune, metabolic and neuropsychiatric. Many of these biological effects result from the production of bacterial metabolites that may target host cells, tissues and organs. In line with this rationale, epigenetics has brought new insights to our understanding of how environmental factors influence gene expression and, interestingly, gut microbiota metabolites have recently been proposed as novel and significant inducers of epigenetic modifications. Efforts have been dedicated to unveil how the production of specific metabolites influences the activity of epigenetic writers and erasers in order to establish a mechanistic link between gut microbiota, epigenetic modifications and health. Recent data is now evidencing how specific microbial metabolites shape the epigenetic landscape of eukaryotic cells, paving new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies relying on diet-driven microbiota: epigenetic interactions. Herein is discussed the impact of diet on gut microbiota and the molecular mechanisms underlying microbiota-host interactions, highlighting the influence of diet on microbiota metabolome and how this may induce epigenetic modifications in host cells. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that epigenetics may be a key process transducing the effects of diet on gut microbiota with consequences for health and disease. Accordingly, innovating strategies of disease prevention based on a "precision diet", a personalized dietary planning according to specific epigenetic targets, are discussed.},

One was anthropologists' long‐standing interest in the diets of ancestral populations. The second thread was the deeply rooted interest of anthropologists in the food and food‐related behavior of the peoples they studied. These two threads have continued to frame core assumptions within nutritional anthropology: evolutionary history matters; diets change over time; the foods people consume have social meaning but are also related to biological outcomes. This chapter considers examples of research by biological anthropologists that demonstrate current understanding of these core assumptions. It focuses on studies that attempt to understand diet in people's evolutionary past, specifically the Paleolithic period of human evolution and the Neolithic, that is, the transition to agriculture. The chapter notes an exciting new direction in research: the relationship of diet to the gut microbiome.},

Declining physical activity (PA) and sex differences in PA consistently accompany transitions from childhood to adulthood in post-industrialized populations and are attributed to psychosocial and environmental factors. An overarching evolutionary theoretical framework and data from pre-industrialized populations are lacking. In this cross-sectional study we test a hypothesis from life history theory, that adolescent PA reductions reflect an evolved strategy to conserve energy, given the increasing sex-specific energetic demands for growth and reproductive maturation. Detailed measures of PA and pubertal maturation are assessed among Tsimane forager-farmers (age: 7-22 yrs.; 50% female, n=110). We find that 71% of Tsimane sampled meet World Health Organization PA guidelines (≥60 minutes/day of moderate-to-vigorous PA). Consistent with post-industrialized populations, we observe sex differences and inverse age-activity associations mediated by Tanner stage. Physical inactivity in adolescence is distinct from other health risk behaviors and also not merely resulting from obesogenic environments.},

 abstract = {Abstract
Host response to the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. As part of the innate immune system, the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) found on natural killer cells and some T-lymphocytes are genetically diverse and play key functions in the host response against viral pathogens. In the last decade, there has been substantial growth in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics capacity to understand human host genetics, including KIR. However, there is limited literature on how the KIR diversity informs the perspectives on HIV disease states in understudied African settings. A better understanding of the effects of KIRs on the host’s immune response to HIV in African settings is essential to inform strategies to develop more effective therapies and vaccines to improve health among people living with HIV (PLWH). In this paper, we review KIR diversity, the role of KIR immunogenetic variation in the human host response to HIV, discuss current perspectives on the studies to assess the relationship between KIR diversity and the HIV disease continuum, and suggest future research prospects.},

 abstract = {This book on lifestyle medicine has focused on the prevention of the development and progression of dysglycemia- and transculturalized cardiometabolic-based chronic diseases (DBCD; tCMBCD). The deliverables for this book are prompted by a growing burden of these noncommunicable diseases and are deliberated in three parts: (1) “Problem” – demonstration of epidemiological and mechanistic substantiation that justifies a need for lifestyle medicine intervention; (2) “Premise” – a robust and comprehensive modeling that blends biological and social drivers, progressive evolution through discrete stages over time, precision to serve as an adaptive template to guide thought and action, and a preventive care paradigm to reduce chronic disease risk in a meaningful way; and (3) “Evidence” – pragmatic interventions to optimize a correct trajectory as lifestyle medicine evolves in a complex healthcare system. Subsequently, the key findings of this book are analyzed and then derived affirmed and emergent concepts synthesized into core recommendations for early and sustainable lifestyle medicine care plans on both individual- and population-based scales: (1) to implement routine case finding for insulin resistance in patients at risk for DBCD/tCMBCD; (2) to conduct research on lifestyle medicine and DMBD/tCMBCD; (3) to routinely discuss and guide healthy lifestyle change in patients with DBCD/tCMBCD; and (4) to reduce DBCD/tCMBCD burden on a population scale. Behaviors and lifestyle choices are responsible for the vast majority of risk factors for dysglycemia- and transculturalized cardiometabolic-based chronic diseases. In the modern world, an understanding of the arc of metabolic regulation and risks that occur at all life stages for an individual patient, including epigenetic phenomena affecting primordial processes, metabolic control during growth and development, energy homeostasis during adulthood, and the dysregulation that leads to prediabetes, T2D, and cardiometabolic disease can guide clinical practice in lifestyle medicine. To sum up, the relationships among manifold risk factors conferred by primary drivers of lifestyle with healthy versus unhealthy cardiometabolic phenotypes can be understood in terms of drivers, mechanisms, and networking effects. Systemic improvements, including reimbursement models that promote disease prevention, policies that support a healthy built environment, and empowered and motivated patients that lead to better outcomes, all work together to drive the practice of lifestyle medicine.},

In humans, most research on mother–infant bonding is based on Western cultures and conducted in European and American countries. Thus, it is still unknown which aspects of mother–infant behaviors are universal and which vary with culture. Here we test whether typical mother–infant behaviors of affect-communication and affect-regulation are equally represented during spontaneous interaction in Palestinian-Arab and Jewish cultures. 30 Palestinian-Arab and 43 Jewish mother–infant dyads were recruited and videotaped. Using AffectRegulation Coding System (ARCS), we behaviorally analyzed the second-by-second display of valence and arousal in each participant and calculated the dynamic patterns of affect co-regulation. The results show that Palestinian-Arab infants express more positive valence than Jewish infants and that Palestinian-Arab mothers express higher arousal compared to Jewish mothers. Moreover, we found culturally-distinct strategies to regulate the infant: increased arousal in Palestinian-Arab dyads and increased mutual affective match in Jewish dyads. Such cross-cultural differences in affect indicate that basic features of emotion that are often considered universal are differentially represented in different cultures. Affect communication and regulation patterns can be transmitted across generations in early-life socialization with caregivers.},

The present study explores the development of cooperative behaviour among the Agta, a Filipino hunter-gatherer population. A simple resource allocation game assessing both levels of cooperation (how much children shared) and patterns of partner choice (who they shared with) was played with 179 children between the ages of 3 and 18. Children were given five resources (candies) and for each was asked whether to keep it for themselves or share with someone else, and if so, who this was. Between-camp variation in children's cooperative behaviour was substantial, and the only strong predictor of children's cooperation was the average level of cooperation among adults in camp; that is, children were more cooperative in camps where adults were more cooperative. Neither age, sex, relatedness or parental levels of cooperation were strongly associated with the amount children shared. Children preferentially shared with close kin (especially siblings), although older children increasingly shared with less-related individuals. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding cross-cultural patterns of children's cooperation, and broader links with human cooperative childcare and life history evolution.},

 abstract = {BackgroundManaged southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) serve as assurance populations for wild conspecifics threatened by poaching and other anthropocentric effects, though many managed populations experience subfertility and reproductive failure. Gut microbiome and host health are inextricably linked, and reproductive outcomes in managed southern white rhinoceros may be mediated in part by their diet and gut microbial diversity. Thus, understanding microbial dynamics within managed populations may help improve conservation efforts. We characterized the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome in the managed population of female southern white rhinoceros (n = 8) at the North Carolina Zoo and investigated the effects of seasonality (summer vs. winter) and age classes (juveniles (n = 2; 0–2 years), subadults (n = 2; 3–7 years), and adults (n = 4; >7 years)) on microbial richness and community structure. Collection of a fecal sample was attempted for each individual once per month from July-September 2020 and January-March 2021 resulting in a total of 41 samples analyzed. Microbial DNA was extracted and sequenced using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene. Total operational taxonomic units (OTUs), alpha diversity (species richness, Shannon diversity), and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, linear discriminant analysis effect size) indices were examined, and differentially enriched taxa were identified.ResultsThere were differences (p < 0.05) in alpha and beta diversity indices across individuals, age groups, and sampling months. Subadult females had higher levels of Shannon diversity (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05) compared to adult females and harbored a community cluster distinct from both juveniles and adults. Samples collected during winter months (January-March 2021) possessed higher species richness and statistically distinct communities compared to summer months (July-September 2020) (PERMANOVA, p < 0.05). Reproductively active (n = 2) and currently nonreproductive adult females (n = 2) harbored differentially enriched taxa, with the gut microbiome of nonreproductive females significantly enriched (p = 0.001) in unclassified members of Mobiluncus, a genus which possesses species associated with poor reproductive outcomes in other animal species when identified in the cervicovaginal microbiome.ConclusionTogether, our results increase the understanding of age and season related microbial variation in southern white rhinoceros at the North Carolina Zoo and have identified a potential microbial biomarker for reproductive concern within managed female southern white rhinoceros.},

 abstract = {BackgroundDuring the course of history, various important lifestyle changes have caused profound transitions of the gut microbiome. These include the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry, a shift from a nomadic to a more sedentary lifestyle, and recently increased levels of urbanization and a transition towards a more Western lifestyle. The latter is linked with shifts in the gut microbiome that have a reduced fermentative capability and which are commonly associated with diseases of affluence. In this study, in which 5193 subjects are included, we investigated the direction of microbiome shifts that occur in various ethnicities living in Amsterdam by comparing 1st and 2nd generation participants. We furthermore validated part of these findings with a cohort of subjects that moved from rural Thailand to the USA.ResultsThe abundance of the Prevotella cluster, which includes P. copri and the P. stercorea trophic network, diminished in the 2nd generation Moroccans and Turks but also in younger Dutch, whilst the Western-associated Bacteroides/Blautia/Bifidobacterium (BBB) cluster, which has an inverse correlation with α-diversity, increased. At the same time, the Christensenellaceae/Methanobrevibacter/Oscillibacter trophic network, which is positively associated with α-diversity and a healthy BMI, decreased in younger Turks and Dutch. Large compositional shifts were not observed in South-Asian and African Surinamese, in whom the BBB cluster is already dominant in the 1st generation, but ASV-level shifts towards certain species, associated amongst others with obesity, were observed.ConclusionThe Moroccan and Turkish populations, but also the Dutch population are transitioning towards a less complex and fermentative less capable configuration of the gut microbiota, which includes a higher abundance of the Western-associated BBB cluster. The Surinamese, whom have the highest prevalence of diabetes and other diseases of affluence, are already dominated by the BBB cluster. Given the continuous increase in diseases of affluence, this devolution towards low-diversity and fermentatively less capable gut microbiome compositions in urban environments is a worrying development.9koSLJh1fDbsjUtu7rD1NMVideo AbstractGraphical Abstract},

 abstract = {The maintenance of redox homeostasis is associated with a healthy status while the disruption of this mechanism leads to the development of various pathological conditions. Bioactive molecules such as carbohydrates accessible to the microbiota (MACs), polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are food components best characterized for their beneficial effect on human health. In particular, increasing evidence suggests that their antioxidant ability is involved in the prevention of several human diseases. Some experimental data indicate that the activation of the nuclear factor 2-related erythroid 2 (Nrf2) pathway-the key mechanism in the maintenance of redox homeostasis-is involved in the beneficial effects exerted by the intake of PUFAs and polyphenols. However, it is known that the latter must be metabolized before becoming active and that the intestinal microbiota play a key role in the biotransformation of some ingested food components. In addition, recent studies, indicating the efficacy of the MACs, polyphenols, and PUFAs in increasing the microbial population with the ability to yield biologically active metabolites (e.g., polyphenol metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)), support the hypothesis that these factors are responsible for the antioxidant action on the physiology of the host. The underlying mechanisms through which MACs, polyphenols, and PUFAs might influence the redox status have not been fully elucidated, but based on the efficacy of SCFAs as Nrf2 activators, their contribution to the antioxidant efficacy of dietary bioactives cannot be excluded. In this review, we aimed to summarize the main mechanisms through which MACs, polyphenols, and PUFAs can modulate the host's redox homeostasis through their ability to directly or indirectly activate the Nrf2 pathway. We discuss their probiotic effects and the role played by the alteration of the metabolism/composition of the gut microbiota in the generation of potential Nrf2-ligands (e.g., SCFAs) in the host's redox homeostasis.},

While there is some evidence to suggest that belief in supernatural punishment and monitoring generally induce cooperative behaviour, the effect of a deity's <i>explicitly postulated</i> moral concerns on cooperation remains unclear. Here, we report a pre-registered set of analyses to assess whether perceiving a locally relevant deity as moralistic predicts cooperative play in two permutations of two economic games using data from up to 15 diverse field sites. Across games, results suggest that gods' moral concerns do not play a direct, cross-culturally reliable role in motivating cooperative behaviour.

@article{pub.1158107940,
 abstract = {Like the majority of non-communicable diseases that have recently gained attention, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGID) in both children and adults are caused by a variety of medical conditions. In general, while it is often thought that common conditions such as obesity may cause other problems, for example, asthma or mental health issues, more consideration needs to be given to the possibility that they could both be brought on by a single underlying problem. Based on the variations in non-communicable disease, in recent years, our group has been revisiting the exact role of the intestinal microbiome within the Vertebrata. While the metabolic products of the microbiome have a role to play in the adult, our tentative conclusion is that the fully functioning, mutualistic microbiome has a primary role: to transfer antigen information from the mother to the neonate in order to calibrate its immune system, allowing it to survive within the microbial environment into which it will emerge. Granted that the microbiome possesses such a function, logic suggests the need for a robust, flexible, mechanism allowing for the partition of nutrition in the mature animal, thus ensuring the continued existence of both the vertebrate host and microbial guest, even under potentially unfavourable conditions. It is feasible that this partition process acts by altering the rate of peristalsis following communication through the gut–brain axis. The final step of this animal–microbiota symbiosis would then be when key microbes are transferred from the female to her progeny, either live offspring or eggs. According to this scheme, each animal inherits twice, once from its parents’ genetic material and once from the mother’s microbiome with the aid of the father’s seminal microbiome, which helps determine the expression of the parental genes. The key point is that the failure of this latter inheritance in humans leads to the distinctive manifestations of functional FGID disorders including inflammation and gut motility disturbances. Furthermore, it seems likely that the critical microbiome–gut association occurs in the first few hours of independent life, in a process that we term handshaking. Note that even if obvious disease in childhood is avoided, the underlying disorders may intrude later in youth or adulthood with immune system disruption coexisting with gut–brain axis issues such as excessive weight gain and poor mental health. In principle, investigating and perhaps supplementing the maternal microbiota provide clinicians with an unprecedented opportunity to intervene in long-term disease processes, even before the child is born.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Females in the perimenopausal period are susceptible to mood disorders. Perimenopausal panic disorder (PPD) is characterized by repeated and unpredictable panic attacks during perimenopause, and it impacts the patient's physical and mental health and social function. Pharmacotherapy is limited in the clinic, and its pathological mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota is strongly linked to emotion; however, the relation between PPD and microbiota is limitedly known.
Methods: This study aimed to discover specific microbiota in PPD patients and the intrinsic connection between them. Gut microbiota was analyzed in PPD patients (<i>n</i> = 40) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 40) by 16S rRNA sequencing.
Results: The results showed reduced α-diversity (richness) in the gut microbiota of PPD patients. β-diversity indicated that PPD and healthy controls had different intestinal microbiota compositions. At the genus level, 30 species of microbiota abundance had significantly different between the PPD and healthy controls. In addition, HAMA, PDSS, and PASS scales were collected in two groups. It was found that Bacteroides and Alistipes were positively correlated with PASS, PDSS, and HAMA.
Discussion: Bacteroides and Alistipes dysbiosis dominate imbalanced microbiota in PPD patients. This microbial alteration may be a potential pathogenesis and physio-pathological feature of PPD. The distinct gut microbiota can be a potential diagnostic marker and a new therapeutic target for PPD.},

 abstract = {Grandmother presence can improve the number and survival of their grandchildren, but what grandmothers protect against and how they achieve it remains poorly known. Before modern medical care, infections were leading causes of childhood mortality, alleviated from the nineteenth century onwards by vaccinations, among other things. Here, we combine two individual-based datasets on the genealogy, cause-specific mortality and vaccination status of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Finns to investigate two questions. First, we tested whether there were cause-specific benefits of grandmother presence on grandchild survival from highly lethal infections (smallpox, measles, pulmonary and diarrhoeal infections) and/or accidents. We show that grandmothers decreased all-cause mortality, an effect which was mediated through smallpox, pulmonary and diarrhoeal infections, but not via measles or accidents. Second, since grandmothers have been suggested to increase vaccination coverage, we tested whether the grandmother effect on smallpox survival was mediated through increased or earlier vaccination, but we found no evidence for such effects. Our findings that the beneficial effects of grandmothers are in part driven by increased survival from some (but not all) childhood infections, and are not mediated via vaccination, have implications for public health, societal development and human life-history evolution.},

 abstract = {Vaginal and rectal specimens were obtained from cycling, pregnant, and nursing rhesus monkeys to assess pregnancy-related changes in the commensal bacteria in their reproductive and intestinal tracts. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, significant differences were found only in the vagina at mid-gestation, not in the hindgut. To verify the apparent stability in gut bacterial composition at mid-gestation, the experiment was repeated with additional monkeys, and similar results were found with both 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. A follow-up study investigated if bacterial changes in the hindgut might occur later in pregnancy. Gravid females were assessed closer to term and compared to nonpregnant females. By late pregnancy, significant differences in bacterial composition, including an increased abundance of 4 species of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i>, were detected, but without a shift in the overall community structure. Progesterone levels were assessed as a possible hormone mediator of bacterial change. The relative abundance of only some taxa (e.g., <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>) were specifically associated with progesterone. In summary, pregnancy changes the microbial profiles in monkeys, but the bacterial diversity in their lower reproductive tract is different from women, and the composition of their intestinal symbionts remains stable until late gestation when several Firmicutes become more prominent.},

 abstract = {Globally, tuberculosis (TB) is the second most lethal infectious disease. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, TB has the largest disease burden, with drug-resistant TB increasingly becoming a concern. The social and economic impact of TB should not be overlooked, especially in areas where healthcare systems are overburdened, and resources need to be allocated judiciously. The aim of pharmacogenetics (PGx) is to improve therapeutic response and to minimize adverse drug reactions by selecting the most optimal drug and dosage for the individual patient. Implementation of PGx into routine clinical care has been slow, especially in resource-limited settings, because of perceived high costs relative to uncertain benefit. Given the impact of TB on the disease and disability burden in these regions, a better understanding and optimization of TB treatment in understudied African populations is vital. The first weeks of treatment are the most crucial for treatment success, and a point-of-care pre-emptive PGx test could start patients on the most bactericidal and least toxic drug combination. This may potentially reduce the number of patients returning to clinical care and streamline the use of limited resources across the healthcare system. This review explores the status of TB PGx in Africa, the utility of existing TB PGx testing panels, and the economic feasibility in developing a clinically valuable, cost-effective, pre-emptive PGx test to guide optimized, new dosing regimens specifically for African population groups. TB is a disease of poverty, but investment in PGx research in African populations could ensure improved treatments and long-term cost savings.},

BSHs catalyze the production of unconjugated BAs and regulate the homeostasis of BA pool. This study identified <i>Lactobacillus</i> as a crucial BSH-encoding genus, and 16 main species were obtained using metagenomic data from publicly available human gut microbiome databases. Then, the 16 species of lactobacilli were classified into four typical categories by BSH phylotypes, including five species encoding BSH-T0, six species encoding BSH-T2, four species encoding BSH-T3, and <i>Ligilactobacillus salivarius</i> encoding both BSH-T0 and BSH-T3. The lactobacilli with the highest in vitro deconjugation activities against seven conjugated BAs were the BSH-T3-encoding strains. Furthermore, in vivo studies in mice administered four representative lactobacilli strains encoding different BSH phylotypes showed that treatment with BSH-T3-encoding <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> altered the structure of the gut microbiome and metabolome and significantly increased the levels of unconjugated BAs and total BA excretion. Our findings facilitated the taxonomic identification of crucial BSH-encoding lactobacilli in human gut microbiota and shed light on their contributions toward modulation of the enterohepatic circulation of BAs, which will contribute to future therapeutic applications of BSH-encoding probiotics to improve human health.},

Here, we describe the eukaryome along the gastrointestinal tract of children aged 2-5 years and test for associations with clinical factors such as anaemia, intestinal inflammation, chronic undernutrition, and age. Children were enrolled from December 2016 to May 2018 in Bangui, Central African Republic and Antananarivo, Madagascar. We analyzed a total of 1104 samples representing 212 gastric, 187 duodenal, and 705 fecal samples using a metabarcoding approach targeting the full ITS2 region for fungi, and the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene for the overall eukaryome. Roughly, half of all fecal samples showed microeukaryotic reads. We find high intersubject variability, only a handful of taxa that are likely residents of the gastrointestinal tract, and frequent co-occurrence of eukaryotes within an individual. We also find that the eukaryome differs between the stomach, duodenum, and feces and is strongly influenced by country of origin. Our data show trends towards higher levels of <i>Fusarium equiseti</i>, a mycotoxin producing fungus, and lower levels of the protist <i>Blastocystis</i> in stunted children compared to nonstunted controls. Overall, the eukaryome is poorly correlated with clinical variables. Our study is of one of the largest cohorts analyzing the human intestinal eukaryome to date and the first to compare the eukaryome across different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract. Our results highlight the importance of studying populations across the world to uncover common features of the eukaryome in health.},

 abstract = {Background: Increasing evidence from observational studies and clinical experimentation has indicated a link between the gut microbiotas (GMs) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), however, the causality and direction of causality between gut microbiome and PCOS remains to be established.
Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of four databases-PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase up until June 1, 2023, and subjected the results to a meta-analysis. In this study, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for PCOS comprised 113,238 samples, while the GWAS data for gut microbiota were derived from the MiBioGen consortium, encompassing a total sample size of 18,340 individuals. As the largest dataset of its kind, this study represents the most comprehensive genome-wide meta-analysis concerning gut microbiota composition to date. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables at various taxonomic levels, including Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus. The causal associations between exposures and outcomes were assessed using four established MR methods. To correct for multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) method was applied. The reliability and potential biases of the results were evaluated through sensitivity analysis and F-statistics.
Results: The meta-analysis incorporated a total of 20 studies that met the criteria, revealing a close association between PCOS and specific gut microbiota species. As per the results from our MR analysis, we identified six causal associations between the gut microbiome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). At the genus level, <i>Actinomyces</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 1.369, <i>FDR</i> = 0.040), <i>Streptococcus</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 1.548, <i>FDR</i> = 0.027), and <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-005</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 1.488, <i>FDR</i> = 0.028) were identified as risk factors for PCOS. Conversely, <i>Candidatus Soleaferrea</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.723, <i>FDR</i> = 0.040), <i>Dorea</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.580, <i>FDR</i> = 0.032), and <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-011</i> (OR<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.732, <i>FDR</i> = 0.030) were found to be protective factors against PCOS. Furthermore, the MR-PRESSO global test and MR-Egger regression indicated that our study results were not affected by horizontal pleiotropy (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Finally, the leave-one-out analysis corroborated the robustness of the MR findings.
Conclusion: Both our meta-analysis and MR study indicates that there is a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and PCOS, which may contribute to providing novel insights for the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for PCOS.},

Here, we review how factors related to host genetics, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location help explain this variation. Studies from contrasting environmental scenarios point to diet and lifestyle as the most influential. The effect of human migration and displacement demonstrates how the microbiome adapts to newly adopted lifestyles and contributes to the profound biological and health consequences attributed to migration. This information strongly suggests against a universal scale for healthy or dysbiotic gut microbiomes, and prompts for additional microbiome population surveys, particularly from less industrialized nations. Considering these important differences will be critical for designing strategies to diagnose and restore dysbiosis in various human populations.},

 abstract = {Breastfeeding brings many benefits to both mother and infant. Although, many women stop breastfeeding their infants too soon. The perceived association between breastfeeding and sleep may influence their decision to terminate breastfeeding. In our systematic review, we focused on mapping the relationship between infant feeding method and total sleep time (TST), number of nocturnal awakenings, awakenings after sleep onset (WASO) of mothers and infants and sleep quality of mothers. We searched four databases according to selected keywords and inclusion criteria - articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2012 and 2022; English language; a sample consisting of mothers, infants, or both (without psychiatric and health problems); a comparison of the sleep quality of breastfed and formula-fed children or breastfeeding and formula-fed mothers. We read 260 full texts of selected articles. A total of 35 articles were included in this review. Due to significant heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not possible to accomplish. The results are processed according to narrative synthesis. Most studies agree that breastfed infants wake up more often at night. Total sleep time and time spent awake during the night (WASO) did not differ between breastfed and non-breastfed infants. We observed identical results in sleep variables among mothers. Additionally, there was no difference in maternal sleep quality. The synthesis revealed that the results may have differed due to using subjective, objective methods or the infant's age. It is important to remember that night waking is a more complex concept. Infants wake for many reasons, not just due to breastfeeding. The narrative synthesis indicated that the chosen study design, measurement method, the variables, and the infant's age could influence outcomes. In addition, other variables appeared that may affect the entire process. Therefore, we recommend that attention be paid to this in future studies.},

 abstract = {Theories of human development informed by cultural anthropology and evolutionary biology suggest that aspects of human prosociality are influenced by grandparents’ interactions with grandchildren. Yet, the traditional focus within developmental psychology on European American nuclear families has yielded little empirical work on this topic. Recognizing the prevalence of live-in grandparents in Latinx communities, we conducted a preregistered study with young Latinx children (N = 250, Mchild age = 5.02 years old). The study was intentionally designed to take place within the supermajority Latinx neighborhoods of Los Angeles County. These are low-income, urban neighborhoods with high rates of grandparent involvement with grandchildren. Because the study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, we set up a mobile lab in an outdoor setting, which allowed us to use an experimental, prosocial behavioral-choice task that involved random assignment. Predicted probabilities from a logistic regression model showed that Latinx children with grandparents living at home were 1.56 times as likely to exhibit prosocial choice behavior as those who did not have grandparents living at home, and this effect was significant while controlling for other preregistered covariates (education, economic insecurity, gender, age, etc.). These findings of an association between the presence of Latinx grandparents and children’s prosociality contribute to our understanding of Latinx psychology and child-rearing. The findings also have broader implications for theories of culture, socialization, and prosociality. Las teorías del desarrollo humano basadas en la antropología cultural y la biología evolutiva sugieren que algunos aspectos de la prosocialidad humana se ven influidos por las interacciones de los abuelos con los nietos. Sin embargo, el enfoque tradicional de la psicología del desarrollo sobre las familias nucleares euroestadounidenses ha dado lugar a pocos trabajos empíricos sobre este tema. Reconociendo la prevalencia de los abuelos que viven con sus nietos en las comunidades latinx, realizamos un estudio prerregistrado con niños latinx pequeños (N = 250, Medad del menor = 5.02). El estudio se diseñó deliberadamente para que se llevara a cabo en los barrios de amplia mayoría latinx del condado de Los Ángeles. Se trata de barrios urbanos de bajos ingresos con altos índices de participación de los abuelos con los nietos. Dado que el estudio se llevó a cabo durante la pandemia de COVID-19, instalamos un laboratorio móvil en un entorno al aire libre, lo que nos permitió utilizar una tarea experimental de elección de conducta prosocial que implicaba una asignación aleatoria. Las probabilidades predichas a partir de un modelo de regresión logística mostraron que los niños latinx con abuelos que viven en casa tenían 1.56 veces más probabilidad de mostrar un comportamiento de elección prosocial que los que no tenían abuelos viviendo en casa, y este efecto era significativo mientras se controlaban otras covariables prerregistradas (educación, inseguridad económica, género, edad, etc.). Estos hallazgos de una asociación entre la presencia de abuelos latinx y la prosocialidad de los niños contribuyen a nuestra comprensión de la psicología y la crianza de los niños latinx. Los hallazgos también tienen implicaciones más amplias para las teorías de la cultura, la socialización y la prosocialidad.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Social interactions shape the infant microbiome by providing opportunities for caregivers to spread bacteria through physical contact. With most research focused on the impact of maternal-infant contact on the infant gut microbiome, it is unclear how alloparents (i.e., caregivers other than the parents) influence the bacterial communities of infant body sites that are frequently contacted during bouts of caregiving, including the skin.
METHODS: To begin to understand how allocare may influence the diversity of the infant microbiome, detailed questionnaire data on infant-alloparent relationships and specific allocare behaviors were coupled with skin and fecal microbiome samples (four body sites) from 48 infants living in Chicago, United States.
RESULTS: Data from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that infant skin and fecal bacterial diversity showed strong associations (positive and negative) to having female adult alloparents. Alloparental feeding and co-sleeping displayed stronger associations to infant bacterial diversity compared to playing or holding. The associations with allocare behaviors differed in magnitude and direction across infant body sites. Bacterial relative abundances varied by infant-alloparent relationship and breastfeeding status.
CONCLUSION: This study provides some of the first evidence of an association between allocare and infant skin and fecal bacterial diversity. The results suggest that infants' exposure to bacteria from the social environment may vary based on infant-alloparent relationships and allocare behaviors. Since the microbiome influences immune system development, variation in allocare that impacts the diversity of infant bacterial communities may be an underexplored dimension of the social determinants of health in early life.},

 abstract = {Introduction: The status of an impaired gut microbial community, known as dysbiosis, is associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance. The use of probiotics has been considered an effective approach for the treatment and prevention of obesity and related gut microbial dysbiosis. The anti-obesity effect of <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> AO356 was recently reported. However, the effect of <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 on the gut microbiota has not yet been identified. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 on gut microbiota and ensure its safety for use as a probiotic.
Methods: Oral administration of <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 (10<sup>7</sup> colony-forming units [CFU]/mg per day, 5 days a week, for 10 weeks) to mice fed a high-fat diet significantly suppressed weight gain and fat mass. We investigated the composition of gut microbiota and explored its association with obesity-related markers.
Results: Oral administration of <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 significantly changed the gut microbiota and modified the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bacteroides, and Oscillospira</i>. <i>Bacteroides and Oscillospira</i> were significantly related to the lipid metabolism pathway and obesity-related markers. We also confirmed the safety of <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 using antibiotics resistance, hemolysis activity, bile salt hydrolase activity, lactate production, and toxicity tests following the safety assessment guidelines of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS).
Discussion: This study demonstrated that <i>L. paracasei</i> AO356 is not only associated with an anti-obesity effect but also with changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways related to obesity. Furthermore, the overall safety assessment seen in this study could increase the potential use of new probiotic materials with anti-obesity effects.},

 abstract = {Life-history theory suggests that individuals should reproduce until death, yet females of a small number of mammals live for a significant period after ceasing reproduction, a phenomenon known as post-reproductive lifespan. It is thought that the evolution of this trait is facilitated by increasing local relatedness throughout a female's lifetime. This allows older females to gain inclusive fitness through helping their offspring (known as a mother effect) and/or grandoffspring (known as a grandmother effect), rather than gaining direct fitness through reproducing. However, older females may only benefit from stopping reproducing when their direct offspring compete with those of their daughters. Here, we investigate whether a lack of post-reproductive lifespan in long-finned pilot whales (<i>Globicephala melas</i>) results from minimal benefits incurred from the presence of older females, or from a lack of costs resulting from mother-daughter co-reproduction. Using microsatellite data, we conducted parentage analysis on individuals from 25 pods and find that younger females were more likely to have offspring if their mother was present in their pod, indicating that mothers may assist inexperienced daughters to reproduce. However, we found no evidence of reproductive conflict between co-reproducing mothers and daughters, indicating that females may be able to reproduce into old age while simultaneously aiding their daughters in reproduction. This highlights the importance of reproductive conflict in the evolution of a post-reproductive lifespan and demonstrates that mother and grandmother effects alone do not result in the evolution of a post-reproductive lifespan.},

 abstract = {High-throughput sequencing allows for the comprehensive analysis of the human intestinal microbiota. However, extensive association analyses between the microbiome and lifestyle differences in the Chinese population are limited. Here, we carried out an independent cohort study—the Chinese Healthy Gut Project (n = 483)—where correlations between the gut microbiota and dietary and lifestyle variables in a healthy Chinese population are defined. We collected both questionnaire data, including basic information and lifestyle and dietary variables, and fecal stools from the enrolled volunteers. We then performed 16S rRNA sequencing on the microbial DNA isolated from the stools to assess the composition of the intestinal microbiota. We found that Prevotella and Bacteroides were the most abundant genera in the healthy Chinese gut microbiome. Additionally, 9 out of 29 clinical and questionnaire-based phenotype covariates were found to be associated with the variation in the composition of the gut microbiota. Among these lifestyle phenotypes, sleep procrastination, negative mood, and drinking habits had the largest effect size. Additionally, an appreciable effect of urbanization was observed, resulting in decreased intra-individual diversity, increased inter-individual diversity, and an increased abundance of the Bacteroides enterotype. The results of this study provide a foundation for assessing the healthy Chinese gut microbiota community structure at baseline in a healthy Chinese population. Furthermore, this study also provides insights into understanding how distinctive living habits influence the relationships between the Chinese gut microbiome and systemic health state.},

 abstract = {Gishimangeda Cave, near Lake Eyasi in northern Tanzania, exemplifies many challenges inherent in studying poorly documented “legacy collections” in African archaeology. The archaeological assemblage of at least twelve human individuals and associated artifacts was excavated in 1967 for primarily physical anthropological purposes. However, it has been difficult to link the materials to archaeological contexts or chronology. Recently, ancient DNA analysis of eleven individuals, eight of whom yielded direct dates of the later third millennium and early second millennium BP, has reinvigorated interest in what the site can reveal about social processes during the Pastoral Neolithic era (~5000–1200 years before present) and the transition to food production in eastern Africa. Here, we present an in-depth investigation of the history of research and excavation, and we provide descriptions of the human skeletal remains and material culture at Gishimangeda Cave and their archaeological contexts reconstructed using archival documents and photographs. Osteological analyses reveal individuals’ lived experiences and health. Three individuals have bilateral lesions on their petrous pyramids consistent with chronic otitis media, a condition that has yet to be archaeologically documented in eastern Africa. Through the analysis of the artifacts, we establish connections between Gishimangeda Cave and broadly contemporaneous herder and forager communities in the Lake Eyasi Basin. This case study illustrates the challenges and potential benefits of working with legacy collections in African archaeology. The article contributes to wider discussions in archaeology and museum studies about museum collections and the evolving ethical and scholarly obligations to them.},

I show that civil conflict is explained by ethnic groups’ cultural distance to the central government: an increase in cultural distance, proxied by linguistic distance, increases an ethnicity’s propensity to fight over government power. To identify this effect, I leverage within-ethnicity variation in linguistic distance resulting from power transitions between ethnic groups over time. I provide evidence that the effects can be attributed to differences in preferences over both the allocation and the type of public goods.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota has a significant role in human health and is affected by many factors. Diet and dietary components have profound impacts on the composition of the gut microbiome and largely contribute to the change in bacterial flora. A high-fiber diet increased dietary fiber (DF) fermentation and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which increased the number of microorganisms. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs), a subgroup of fermentable carbohydrates such as DF, are defined as indigestible carbohydrates metabolized by microbes. These carbohydrates are important components to sustain the microbial environment of the complicated digestive tract and avoid intestinal dysbiosis. Each MAC has a unique property and can therefore be used as a sensitive output microbiota modulator to support host homeostasis and modulate health. In addition to the overall health-developing effects, MACs are thought to have a promising effect on the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are major health problems worldwide. The aim of the manuscript was to describe microbiota-accessible carbohydrates and summarize their effects on gut modulation and NCDs.},

 abstract = {Milk is often regarded as the gold standard for the nourishment of all mammalian offspring. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of the life of the infant, followed by a slow introduction of complementary foods to the breastfeeding routine for a period of approximately 2 years, whenever this is possible ( <i>Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding</i>; WHO, 2003). One of the most abundant components in all mammals' milk, which is associated with important health benefits, is the oligosaccharides. The milk oligosaccharides (MOS) of humans and other mammals differ in terms of their concentration and diversity. Among those, goat milk contains more oligosaccharides (<i>g</i>MOS) than other domesticated dairy animals, as well as a greater range of structures. This review summarizes the biological functions of MOS found in both human and goat milk to identify the possible biological relevance of <i>g</i>MOS in human health and development. Based on the existing literature, seven biological functions of <i>g</i>MOS were identified, namely, MOS action as prebiotics, immune modulators, and pathogen traps; their modulation of intestinal cells; protective effect against necrotizing enterocolitis; improved brain development; and positive effects on stressor exposure. Overall, goat milk is a viable alternate supply of functional MOS that could be employed in a newborn formula.},

 abstract = {<p>The gut and skin microbiota play critical roles in host fitness. Anuran amphibian metamorphosis reshapes and restructures their morphology, physiology, and behavior and usually prepares them for a transformation from an aquatic to a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, with drastic changes in food and habitat. Changes in the microbiota on amphibian skin and their gut microbiota through development and the impact of antimicrobial peptides on skin and gut microbiota at different developmental stages is currently not well understood. Here, we use high-throughput 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing to characterize the gut and skin microbiota of three wild anurans, namely, <em>Bufo melanostictus</em>, <em>Kaloula pulchra</em>, and <em>Polypedates megacephalus</em>, and two commercially breed amphibians, namely, <em>Rana catesbeiana</em> and <em>Xenopus laevis</em> during metamorphosis. We found evidence for an adaptive shift in the gut microbiome of these amphibians that is consistent with the transition from a herbivorous to an insectivorous diet during metamorphosis. Multiple members of <em>Actinobacteria</em>, associated with cellulose degradation, were enriched in the early stages of metamorphosis. However, specific <em>Bacteroides</em> from the phylum <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, and associated with proteolysis, were enriched in the later stages of metamorphosis. Additionally, carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) associated with cellulose degradation were enriched in the early stages, whereas insect tissue degrading CAZymes were enriched in later stages. Similarly, the skin bacterial community structure was significantly altered after metamorphosis. Specifically, the abundance anti-<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> (anti-Bd) bacteria increased through developmental and peaked at the adult stage. Antimicrobial peptide bath treatment with PGLa, Magainin I, Magainin II, cecropin, or a cocktail of antimicrobial peptides increased the relative abundance of anti-Bd bacteria including those from the genera <em>Aeromonas</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Citrobacter</em> on the skin at different developmental stages in <em>Xenopus laevis</em>. Meanwhile, antimicrobial peptides, especially Magainin II, increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, namely, <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Sphingomonas</em>, and <em>Christensenella</em>, and reduced the abundance of pathogenic bacteria that included <em>Escherichia, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Streptococcus</em>, <em>and Plesiomonas</em> in the gut. In addition, unlike antibiotics that greatly reduce microbial diversity, these AMPs in general had no significant effect on microbial diversity of the intestinal and skin microbiota. Our study not only provides compelling evidence for the adaptation of gut microbiota composition and function to the dietary transition during amphibian metamorphosis, but also reveals variations in the anti-Bd bacteria on amphibian skin during development. Our findings also provide new insights into the beneficial effects of antimicrobial peptides on the skin and gut microbiota during the entire amphibian developmental process and may be useful for amphibian breeding and protection.</p>},

 abstract = {The proper measurement of emotion is vital to understanding the relationship between emotional expression in social media and other factors, such as online information sharing. This work develops a standardized annotation scheme for quantifying emotions in social media using recent emotion theory and research. Human annotators assessed both social media posts and their own reactions to the posts’ content on scales of 0 to 100 for each of 20 (Study 1) and 23 (Study 2) emotions. For Study 1, we analyzed English-language posts from Twitter (N = 244) and YouTube (N = 50). Associations between emotion ratings and text-based measures (LIWC, VADER, EmoLex, NRC-EIL, Emotionality) demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity. In Study 2, we tested an expanded version of the scheme in-country, in-language, on Polish (N = 3648) and Lithuanian (N = 1934) multimedia Facebook posts. While the correlations were lower than with English, patterns of convergent and discriminant validity with EmoLex and NRC-EIL still held. Coder reliability was strong across samples, with intraclass correlations of .80 or higher for 10 different emotions in Study 1 and 16 different emotions in Study 2. This research improves the measurement of emotions in social media to include more dimensions, multimedia, and context compared to prior schemes.},

 abstract = {As Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) undergoes rapid urbanization changes in diet and lifestyle have contributed to a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) across the region. Changes in gut microbiota which play an important role in human health may be an underlying driving factor. While evidence suggests that the gut microbiota differs between the extreme levels of economic development (least vs highly developed), it is not well-established which factors along the urbanization gradient are most influential, especially for SSA. This systematic review analyzed published articles from SSA countries that examined the differences in the composition and diversity of gut microbiota along the urbanization gradient. The findings of this review have important implications for understanding the impact of urbanization on human health in the SSA. Peer-reviewed articles that examined the link between the urbanization gradient, dietary patterns, and gut microbiota using culture-independent techniques were included in the review. A total of 3,265 studies were identified and screened. Eighty-nine (89) studies underwent full-text review, and 23 studies were extracted and included for final analysis. Among these studies, it was observed that hunter-gatherers had high alpha diversity (within-person variation) and beta diversity (between-person variation) in their gut microbiota compared to rural and urban residents in SSA. However, there were inconsistent differences between rural and urban at the individual taxa levels, potentially due to limited statistical power and large variability in the study techniques and designs. Similarly, there were no clear differences in the relative abundance of genera across the urbanization gradient. Additionally, both diet and intestinal parasites were associated with the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. The review revealed there are variations in both alpha and beta diversity of the gut microbiota across the urbanization gradient with a higher diversity observed in rural areas. However, we did not observe significant differences in the relative abundance at phyla or genus levels consistently across the urbanization gradient. Moreover, our findings suggest that the mode of subsistence, diet, and intestinal parasites play a role in shaping the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in SSA. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021251006, identifier CRD42021251006.},

 abstract = {Abstract Payoff‐biased cultural learning has been extensively discussed in the literature on cultural evolution, but where do payoff currencies come from in the first place? Are they products of genetic or cultural evolution? Here we present a simulation model to explore the possibility of novel payoff currencies emerging through a process of theory construction, where agents come up with “channels” via which different cultural traits contribute to some ultimate payoff and use such “channels” as intermediate payoff currencies to make trait‐updating decisions. We show that theory‐building as a strategy is mostly favored when the noise associated with the ultimate‐level payoff is high, selective pressures are strong, and the probability of arriving at the right theory is high. This approach provides insights into both the emergence of payoff currencies and the role of cognition for causal model building. We close by discussing the implications of our model for the broader question of causal learning in social contexts.
Resumen El aprendizaje cultural sesgado en términos de recompensa ha sido extensivamente discutido en la literatura de la evolución cultural, ¿pero de dónde vinieron los valores de compra en primer lugar? ¿Son ellos productos de evolución genética o cultural? Aquí presentamos un modelo de simulación para explorar la posibilidad de unos valores de recompensa novedosos emergiendo a través de un proceso de construcción de una teoría, donde los agentes idearon “canales” a través de los cuales características culturales diferentes contribuyen a un último pago y usan tales “canales” como formas de pago intermedio para tomar decisiones de actualización de características. Mostramos que la construcción de la teoría como una estrategia es en su mayoría favorecida cuando el ruido asociado con el último nivel de pago es alto, las presiones selectivas son altas y la probabilidad de llegar a la teoría correcta es alta. Esta aproximación provee conocimiento tanto en la emergencia de medios de pago como en el rol de la cognición en la construcción de modelos causales. Concluimos discutiendo las implicaciones de nuestro modelo para la cuestión más amplia del aprendizaje causal en contextos sociales.

Researchers seeking to ‘preserve’ microbial species associated with Indigenous groups, but absent from industrialized populations, have largely failed to include Indigenous people in knowledge co-production or benefit, perpetuating a legacy of intellectual and material extraction. We propose a framework centred on relationality among Indigenous peoples, researchers and microbes, to guide ethical microbiome research. Our framework centres accountability to flatten historical power imbalances that favour researcher perspectives and interests to provide space for Indigenous worldviews in pursuit of Indigenous research sovereignty. Ethical inclusion of Indigenous communities in microbiome research can provide health benefits for all populations and reinforce mutually beneficial partnerships between researchers and the public.},

 abstract = {DEFINITION: Wild edible plants (WEPs) grow naturally in self-maintaining ecosystems. WEPs are harvested for consumption, sale, and medicinal uses. We hypothesize that WEPs play a major role in supplying food and generating income for the rural people in a world that is increasingly recognising its emerging conservation issues. We tested this hypothesis by identifying the reasons for harvest, consumption, and conservation of WEPs using focus group discussion, field observations and questionnaire surveys in south eastern Bhutan in late 2019.
METHODS: Focused group discussions were held with the local people to identify reasons for harvest and consumption of WEPs. Data on the identified reasons for harvest, consumption, and conserving WEPs were determined using a questionnaire survey with ranking scales for a set of 76 randomly selected households. Representative field-observations and questionnaire surveys were carried out in villages close to forests. Parts of the plant used, how these were consumed, harvest season, and plant (life form) were recorded. The data was subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and weighted averages calculated.
RESULT AND CONCLUSION: A total of 120 WEPs belonging to 63 families (including Agaricaceae) were reported. Most of the WEPs recorded were trees (45.0%) then herbs (25.8%), vines (13.3%) and shrubs (10.8%). The commonly consumed plant parts were the fruit (43.3%), shoots (28.3%) and leaves (20.8%). The purposes for harvesting and consumption, conservation of WEPs were significantly (P<0.001) different, while the motivations for collecting WEPs were not. The motivation for collecting WEPs were family consumption > sale > medicinal uses > preservation for future use > insufficient food from cultivated source's. The two most important strategies for conservation were to domesticate the WEPs and cultivate in forests. The findings reveal valuable lessons and insights about the reasons for harvesting, collection, consumption, and conservation of WEPs.},

 abstract = {Coprolites, or mummified feces, are valuable sources of information on ancient cultures as they contain ancient DNA (aDNA). In this study, we analyzed ancient plant DNA isolated from coprolites belonging to two pre-Columbian cultures (Huecoid and Saladoid) from Vieques, Puerto Rico, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing to reconstruct diet and lifestyles. We also analyzed DNA sequences of putative phytopathogenic fungi, likely ingested during food consumption, to further support dietary habits. Our findings show that pre-Columbian Caribbean cultures had a diverse diet consisting of maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), chili peppers (Capsicum annuum), peanuts (Arachis spp.), papaya (Carica papaya), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and, very surprisingly cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris). Modelling of putative phytopathogenic fungi and plant interactions confirmed the potential consumption of these plants as well as edible fungi, particularly Ustilago spp., which suggest the consumption of maize and huitlacoche. These findings suggest that a variety of dietary, medicinal, and hallucinogenic plants likely played an important role in ancient human subsistence and societal customs. We compared our results with coprolites found in Mexico and the United States, as well as present-day faeces from Mexico, Peru, and the United States. The results suggest that the diet of pre-Columbian cultures resembled that of present-day hunter-gatherers, while agriculturalists exhibited a transitional state in dietary lifestyles between the pre-Columbian cultures and larger scale farmers and United States individuals. Our study highlights differences in dietary patterns related to human lifestyles and provides insight into the flora present in the pre-Columbian Caribbean area. Importantly, data from ancient fecal specimens demonstrate the importance of ancient DNA studies to better understand pre-Columbian populations.},

Effects of physical activity on energy expenditure and cardiometabolic health are virtually unstudied in nonhuman primates. We investigated physical activity and metabolic markers in 15 adult ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and 11 Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli) at the Duke Lemur Center during a period of low activity in winter when the animals were housed in buildings (with outdoor access) and a period of high activity when individuals were free-ranging in large, outdoor, forested enclosures. We compared body mass, blood glucose, triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, physical activity via accelerometry, and total energy expenditure (TEE) via the doubly labeled water method (in ring-tailed lemurs only) between both conditions. Both species were more active and had a lower body mass in summer. Ring-tailed lemurs had a higher TEE and lower triglyceride levels in summer, whereas sifaka had higher triglyceride levels in summer. Individuals that increased their activity more, also lost more body mass. Individuals that lost more body mass, also had a positive change in HDL-cholesterol (i.e., higher values in summer). Changes in activity were not associated with changes in markers of metabolic health, body fat percentage and TEE (both unadjusted and adjusted for body composition). Older age was associated with lower activity in both species, and decreased glucose in ring-tailed lemurs, but was otherwise unrelated to metabolic markers and, for ring-tailed lemurs, adjusted TEE. Overall, body mass was lower during summer but the increase in physical activity did not strongly influence metabolic health or TEE in these populations.},

 abstract = {International migration often results in major changes in living environments and lifestyles, and these changes may lead to the observed increases in obesity and diabetes among foreign-born people after resettling in higher-income countries. A possible mechanism linking changes in living environments to the onset of health conditions may be changes in the microbiome. Previous research has shown that unfavorable changes in the composition of the microbiome can increase disposition to diseases such as diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated the relationship between human migration and microbiome composition through a review using microbiome- and migration-related search terms in PubMed and Web of Science. We included articles examining the gut, oral, or oropharyngeal microbiome in people who migrated internationally. Nine articles met eligibility criteria. All but one examined migration from a non-Western to a Western country. Four of these found a difference in the microbiome of migrants compared with non-migrating residents of their country of birth, seven found differences in the microbiome of migrants compared with the native-born population in the country of resettlement, and five found microbiome differences associated with duration of stay in the country of resettlement. Microbiome composition varies with country of birth, age at migration, time since immigration, and country of resettlement. The results suggest that migration may lead to changes in the microbiome; thus, microbiome characteristics are a plausible pathway to examine changes in health after resettlement in a new country.},

 abstract = {Although fungi occupy only a small proportion of the microbial community in the intestinal tract of mammals, they play important roles in host fat accumulation, nutrition metabolism, metabolic health, and immune development. Here, we investigated the dynamics and assembly of gut fungal communities in plateau pikas inhabiting six altitudinal gradients across warm and cold seasons. We found that the relative abundances of <i>Podospora</i> and <i>Sporormiella</i> significantly decreased with altitudinal gradients in the warm season, whereas the relative abundance of <i>Sarocladium</i> significantly increased. Alpha diversity significantly decreased with increasing altitudinal gradient in the warm and cold seasons. Distance-decay analysis showed that fungal community similarities were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation. The co-occurrence network complexity significantly decreased along the altitudinal gradients as the total number of nodes, number of edges, and degree of nodes significantly decreased. Both the null and neutral model analyses showed that stochastic or neutral processes dominated the gut fungal community assembly in both seasons and that ecological drift was the main ecological process explaining the variation in the gut fungal community across different plateau pikas. Homogeneous selection played a weak role in structuring gut fungal community assembly during the warm season. Collectively, these results expand our understanding of the distribution patterns of gut fungal communities and elucidate the mechanisms that maintain fungal diversity in the gut ecosystems of small mammals.},

Post-reproductive representation was 0.195, indicating that a female who reached adulthood could expect to live about one-fifth of her adult life in a post-reproductive state, around half as long as human hunter-gatherers. Post-reproductive females exhibited hormonal signatures of menopause, including sharply increasing gonadotropins after age 50. We discuss whether post-reproductive life spans in wild chimpanzees occur only rarely, as a short-term response to favorable ecological conditions, or instead are an evolved species-typical trait as well as the implications of these alternatives for our understanding of the evolution of post-reproductive life spans.},

Here, we examine the role of godparents—kin and non-kin allomothers that often invest in both mothers and children—to investigate whether having a godparent translates into benefits in terms of the godchild's educational attainment. Among adults in two rural Bolivian communities, we find that having a godparent, whether kin or non-kin and regardless of where they live, does not predict years of education, finishing high school, or pursuing higher education.

 abstract = {Adansonia digitata L (Baobab) is a large plant species which thrives in many semiarid regions of the world with remarkable economic and nutritional importance. In Ethiopia, it grows in deserts and hot lowlands. Industrially, baobab fruit pulp (powder) is used for producing good quality jams. This study was carried out to (a) develop a formulation protocol for producing high-quality baobab jam, (b) characterize the jam using standard physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory evaluation methods, and (c) examine the effects of time and temperature of storage on the quality as well as shelf life of the jam. Out of the seven formulations tested, a formulation enriched with 55 g table sugar, 45 g baobab fruit powder, 0.50 g ascorbic acid, and 0.40 to 0.60 g citrus pectin jelling (formulation no. 6) and another one enriched with 60 g table sugar, 40 g baobab fruit powder, 0.50 g ascorbic acid, and 0.40 to 0.60 g citrus pectin jelling (formulation no. 7) resulted in the best jam products. The jam product of formulation no. 7 enriched with 0.50 g ascorbic acid and 0.60 g citrus pectin jelling was better in terms of storage stability and sensory acceptability. Increasing storage time (up to 45 to 90 days) and temperature (from 10–12°C to 25–27°C) lowered the products’ nutritional quality and sensory acceptability. High-microbial growths were observed in the products stored at higher temperature longer, but all the microbial loads were far below the acceptable limit. In the absence of measures that improve their shelf lives, household and small-scale jam products have to be consumed fresh or within weeks after their preparation.},

 abstract = {Over 80% of adolescents worldwide are insufficiently active, posing massive public health and economic challenges. Declining physical activity (PA) and sex differences in PA consistently accompany transitions from childhood to adulthood in post-industrialized populations and are attributed to psychosocial and environmental factors. An overarching evolutionary theoretical framework and data from pre-industrialized populations are lacking. This cross-sectional study tests hypotheses from life history theory, that adolescent PA is inversely related to age, but this association is mediated by Tanner stage, reflecting higher and sex-specific energetic demands for growth and reproductive maturation. Detailed measures of PA and pubertal maturation are assessed among Tsimane forager-farmers (age: 7-22 years; 50% female, <i>n</i> = 110). Most Tsimane sampled (71%) meet World Health Organization PA guidelines (greater than or equal to 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous PA). Like post-industrialized populations, sex differences and inverse age-activity associations were observed. Tanner stage significantly mediated age-activity associations. Adolescence presents difficulties to PA engagement that warrant further consideration in PA intervention approaches to improve public health.},

We propose that an evolutionary medicine approach is useful to understand this disease from an ultimate perspective and conducted a scoping literature review to synthesize the IBS literature within this framework. Our review suggests five potential evolutionary hypotheses for the cause of IBS, including (a) a dietary mismatch accompanying a nutritional transition, (b) an early hygienic life environment leading to the immune system and microbiotic changes, (c) an outcome of decreased physical activity, (d) a response to changes in environmental light-dark cycles, and (e) an artifact of an evolved fight or flight response. We find key limitations in the available data needed to understand early life, nutritional, and socioeconomic experiences that would allow us to understand evolutionarily relevant risk factors and identify a need for further empirical research to distinguish potential causes and test evolutionary hypotheses.},

 abstract = {Geography shapes the structure and function of human gut microbiomes. In this study, we have explored the available human gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequence datasets of cohorts representing large geographical gradients. The 16S rRNA sequences representing V3-V4 as well as V4 regions generated using Illumina sequencing chemistry in the MiSeq platform encompassing the United States of America, Chile, South Africa, Kuwait, and Malaysia were subjected to in-depth computational biology analyses. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla present in all studied cohorts but Actinobacteria was exclusively present in high abundance in cohorts from Malaysia (15.99%). The relative abundance of five families, namely Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Eubacteriaceae were highest representing the studied cohorts. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that the dissimilarity in the gut microbiome structure of cohorts representing studied countries was significant (R2 = 0.28, P < 0.001). The calculated Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F : B) ratio was found to be lowest in cohorts from South Africa (1.11) and Chile (0.95). The cohorts from South Africa exhibited the highest alpha diversity based on Hill numbers at q=0, whereas at q=1 and 2, cohorts from Malaysia had the highest alpha diversity. The beta diversity analysis revealed that cohorts from Chile formed a distinct cluster among all the studied geographical locations. For the first time, the study also showed that cohorts from Malaysia representing short geographical distances exhibited distinct intrapopulation differences in the gut microbiome and may not be influenced by cultural and genetic factors.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Biological pathways, including individual gut microbiome are potential barriers for maternal nutritional supplementation to improvement in infant growth. We evaluated the impact of balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplementation during pregnancy and the first six months of lactation on the composition and functionality of gut microbiome in mothers and their infants in rural Burkina Faso. Our findings reveal that BEP supplementation led to a significant increase in microbiome diversity during pregnancy. In the second trimester, there was a notable decrease in the abundance of an Oscillospiraceae species, while postpartum, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis increased. We identified concerted enriched or depleted microbial pathways associated with BEP supplementation, including the phosphotransferase system, a critical mechanism for bacterial carbohydrates uptake, which exhibited enrichment in infants born to BEP-supplemented mothers. Despite these observations, the intricate biological connections with other omics necessitate further analysis to fully elucidate the underlying comprehensive biological pathways. },

While several systematic reviews have been done on the effects of diet on mental health via the gut microbiome, there are focused on either specific diets or mental disorders. This systematic review examines the effect of diet and broad-based mental health via the gut microbiome. 21 out of 99 studies published prior to 2023 and listed in PubMed are included. Our analysis suggests that a vegan diet, a Mediterranean-style diet, fiber, probiotics, dietary vitamin D, unpasteurized milk, foods with a low omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, and Xiao Yan San may have positive effects on gut microbiome, leading to a positive influence on mental health, while a meat-rich diet, a high-fat diet, high fructose intake, and zinc deficiency may have negative effects on gut microbiome, leading to a negative influence on mental health. Collectively, the effects of diet on mental health via gut microbiome may be explained by the composition of gut microbiome and the metabolites produced by gut microbiome on gut permeability.   Doi: 10.28991/SciMedJ-2023-05-02-05 Full Text: PDF},

 abstract = {Seasonality is a critical driver of resource availability within individual generations and is therefore likely to have exerted selective pressures on hominin evolution. Nonetheless, it has frequently been overlooked in discussions of early technological variability. This paper examines the relationship between seasonality and lithic investment in the Oldowan of eastern Africa, to broaden our understanding of hominin behavioural adaptability. We develop a framework for the identification of seasonal signatures in the archaeological record and examine the nature of lithic variability across 12 Early Pleistocene localities. In combining these insights, we suggest that seasonality played a pivotal role in shaping the pattern of lithic investment in the Oldowan, with peak investment related to greater wet season processing of plant resources and mobility across the landscape. The productivity of cores, retouching of flakes, and use of percussive implements may each play a role in this seasonal patterning of tool use. Our analysis provides further evidence that Oldowan hominins were able to adapt their technological behaviours to changing environmental conditions, even at the scale of intra-seasonal fluctuations in resource availability, and how this interacts with landscape familiarity over longer timescales.},

We recruited 128 participants, randomly assigned to high and low time pressure conditions to act as judges in a simulated blind-date swindle case. Participants judged nine male faces from the Chicago Face Database with three attractiveness levels (unattractive, neutral and attractive), featuring a 2 × 3 mixed factorial design, with consistent standardized average levels of face trustworthiness. We also assessed participants’ self-reported processing styles (rational vs. experiential) using the Rational Experiential Inventory. Notably, participants predominantly judged unattractive faces as innocent, indicating an ugly leniency effect. Our results suggest the primacy of perceived face trustworthiness over attractiveness in guilt judgments for cases where the accused’s physical appearance might facilitate the crime’s success. This highlights the importance of examining the contribution of perceived trustworthiness to guilt judgment biases, and adds to growing evidence exploring extrajudicial factors in criminal verdicts.},

 abstract = {The emotion of disgust in humans is widely considered to represent a continuation of the disease-avoidance behavior ubiquitous in animals. The extent to which analogs of human disgust are evident in nonhuman animals, however, remains unclear. The scant research explicitly investigating disgust in animals has predominantly focused on great apes and suggests that disgust might be present in a highly muted form. In this review, we outline the main approaches to disgust. We then briefly discuss disease-avoidance behavior in nonhuman animals, proposing a set of criteria against which evidence for the presence or absence of disgust in animals can be evaluated. The resultant decision tree takes into account other plausible causes of avoidance and aversion when evaluating whether it is likely that the behavior represents disgust. We apply this decision tree to evaluate evidence of disgust-like behavior (e.g., avoidance of carrion and avoidance of feces-contaminated food) in several examples, including nonhuman great apes. Finally, we consider the large disparity between disgust in humans compared to muted disgust in other great apes, examining the possibility that heightened disgust in humans is a relatively recent cultural acquisition.},

 abstract = {Background/Objectives: The concept of 'demand' breastfeeding is central in public health. A key feature of the concept is that the infant is the locus of control in the breastfeeding process; when the breast is demanded by the infant, it is given the opportunity to feed. This study questions this notion of the infant as the locus of control in demand breastfeeding for empirical and theoretical reasons. From an evolutionary perspective, infants are expected to seek maximal investment and, against this backdrop of maximal investment-seeking, parents decide how much investment to put into offspring.
Methodology: Focal follows were conducted among 113 mother-infant dyads in Papua New Guinea. During these follows, response times and types of responses, including breastfeeding to offspring fussing and crying, were recorded.
Results: Infants were breastfed an average of 3.6 times/hour for just over 2 min/feed. Fussing and crying were responded to quickly, with most response times under 1 min. When the mother responded, she breastfed the child approximately 52% of the time. The other 48% of the time, mothers responded to infants with other forms of pacification. Mothers were significantly less likely to respond to infants by breastfeeding if the child had been breastfed within the past 59-76 min.
Conclusion/Implications: As predicted by evolutionary parental investment theory, infants make frequent demands on their parents for investment, but mothers are ultimately the locus of control in the investment process. The mother decides whether and how frequently to breastfeed her offspring against this backdrop of near-continuous investment demands.},

 abstract = {Receiving social support from community and extended family has been typical for mothers with infants in human societies past and present. In non-industrialised contexts, infants of mothers with extended family support often have better health and higher survival through the vulnerable infant period, and hence shared infant care has a clear fitness benefit. However, there is scant evidence that these benefits continue in industrialised contexts. Better infant health and development with allocare support would indicate continued evolutionary selection for allocare. The research reported here used multiple logistic regression analysis to test whether a lack of family and other social support for mothers was associated with an increased risk of developmental delay in 9-month-old infants in the UK Millennium Cohort (analysis sample size, 15,696 infants). Extended family-based childcare during work hours and more maternal time spent with friends were the most influential kin and social support variables: infants of mothers with kin-based childcare versus all other childcare arrangements had a lower risk of developmental delay (OR = 0.61, 95% CIs: 0.46–0.82). Infants of mothers who spent no time with friends when compared with those who saw friends every day had double the odds of delay. Greater paternal involvement in infant care was associated with a lower odds of developmental delay. In conclusion, shared care of infants and social support for mothers may influence fitness-related traits in industrialised societies rather than being factors that influenced selection only in the past and in societies which retain close kin networks and a strong local community focus.},

One of the Indonesian efforts is pursued through inter-faith and inter-civilizational dialogue. This research is library research with qualitative methods. The approaches used are historical, political, and Islamic perspectives in contemporary international relations studies, namely Fiqh Siyasah Dauliyah. The study results show that there are two main relevancies between the inter-faith and inter-civilizational dialogue with the principles concept of international relations based on fiqh siyasah dauliyah. First, diversity in Islam is stated as part of God's plan for the benefit of mankind. In this context, the various inter-faith and inter-civilizational dialogues organized by Indonesia are necessary conditions for promoting peace, tolerance, harmony, and religious coexistence in the world today. Second, the concept of dialogue between civilizations and between religions is based on the study of textual analysis and historical interpretation of the Al-Quran and As-Sunnah. In this case, the Al-Quran shows various examples of dialogue, one of which is contained in the Al-Quran Surah An-Nahl verse 125 which asks Muslims to show the best courtesy and wisdom when arguing with people of other religions.

 abstract = {Bacterial wilt is the leading disease of sesame and alters the bacterial community composition, function, and metabolism of sesame rhizosphere soil. However, its pattern of change is unclear. Here, the purpose of this study was to investigate how these communities respond to three differing severities of bacterial wilt in mature continuously cropped sesame plants by metagenomic and metabolomic techniques, namely, absence (WH), moderate (WD5), and severe (WD9) wilt. The results indicated that bacterial wilt could significantly change the bacterial community structure in the rhizosphere soil of continuously cropped sesame plants. The biomarker species with significant differences will also change with increasing disease severity. In particular, the gene expression levels of Ralstonia solanacearum in the WD9 and WD5 treatments increased by 25.29% and 33.61%, respectively, compared to those in the WH treatment (4.35 log<sub>10</sub> copies g-1). The occurrence of bacterial wilt significantly altered the functions of the bacterial community in rhizosphere soil. KEEG and CAZy functional annotations revealed that the number of significantly different functions in WH was greater than that in WD5 and WD9. Bacterial wilt significantly affected the relative content of metabolites, especially acids, in the rhizosphere soil, and compared with those in the rhizosphere soil from WH, 10 acids (including S-adenosylmethionine, N-acetylleucine, and desaminotyrosine, etc.) in the rhizosphere soil from WD5 or WD9 significantly increased. In comparison, the changes in the other 10 acids (including hypotaurine, erucic acid, and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, etc.) were reversed. The occurrence of bacterial wilt also significantly inhibited metabolic pathways such as ABC transporter and amino acid biosynthesis pathways in rhizosphere soil and had a significant impact on two key enzymes (1.1.1.11 and 2.6.1.44). In conclusion, sesame bacterial wilt significantly alters the rhizosphere soil bacterial community structure, function, and metabolites. This study enhances the understanding of sesame bacterial wilt mechanisms and lays the groundwork for future prevention and control strategies against this disease.},

 abstract = {BackgroundWild edible fruits found in Tanzania's miombo woods are an indispensable source of food and medicine. Unfortunately, with the rapid expansion of human activities and urbanisation in the Tabora rural, Uyui and Sikonge districts of Western Tanzania, some wild fruits are disappearing due to the loss of plant diversity. The objectives of this study wereL: to document the knowledge related to wild edible fruits; to quantify the use and cultural significance, and to determine their threats.MethodsThe ethnobotanical study was conducted from June 2022 to February 2023 involving 244 local informants. The study used field visits, the collection of plant parts, and semi-structured interviews with locals for its data collection. Descriptive statistics and correlation test were used to analyse the knowledge related to wild fruits. Frequency citation (f) and use reports (UR) were computed to understand the diversity and cultural significance (CI).ResultsThe study documented 27 wild edible fruit species used for food and medicine. The life form constituted deciduous shrubs or trees (64%), shrub trees (21%) and evergreen or deciduous trees (15%). About (56%) of wild edible fruits were collected from June to August after the rainy season, (33%) were harvested between December and May during the rainy season, and (11%) were gathered from September and November before the rainy season. Household size and sex of the respondents were significantly correlated to the knowledge of wild edible fruits. Higher utilisation frequency (f) was recorded for Vitex mombassae Vatke (f = 0.84), Strychnos spinosa Lam. (f = 0.82), Vitex payos (Lour.) Merr. (f = 0.56), Phyllogeiton discolor (Klotzsch) Herzog. (f = 0.45), Vangueria infausta Burchell (f = 0.45), Tamarindus indica L. (f = 0.38), Parinari curatellifolia (f = 0.25), Landolphia parvifolia K.Schum. (f = 0.22) and Microcos conocarpa Burret (f = 0.22) fruits species. Additionally, Phyllogeiton discolor (Klotzsch) Herzog. (UR = 56), Vitex mombassae Vatke (UR = 56), Tamarindus indica L. (UR = 37), Strychnos spinosa Lam. (UR = 14) and Friesodielsia obovata (Benth.) Verdc. (UR = 11), have higher use reports (UR) and considered culturally important. Wild fruits were used to cure diabetes, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and respiratory infections ailments.Discussion and conclusionMultiple uses as well as the related knowledge of wild fruits have been documented. Friesodielsia obovata, Grewia flavescens Juss and Thespesia garckeana F.Hoffm. are the medicinal fruit species reported for the first time. Harvesting of wood plants, charcoal activities, crop cultivation, grazing expansion, and environmental change, have had an impact on the diversity of wild edible fruit plants. Over the past three decades, the use of wild fruits has been impacted by the loss of plant diversity due to decline of cultural norms on the forests management. Given the variety of uses for wild fruits, promoting markets for native fruits, sensitising the locals about the cultural importance and innovation on processing techniques are necessary to spur conservation efforts.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite repeated public health interventions, anemia prevalence among children remains a concern. We use an evolutionary medicine perspective to examine the intestinal microbiome as a pathway underlying the efficacy of iron-sulfate treatment. This study explores whether gut microbiota composition differs between anemic children who respond and do not respond to treatment at baseline and posttreatment and if specific microbiota taxa remain associated with response to iron supplementation after controlling for relevant inflammatory and pathogenic variables.
METHODS: Data come from 49 pre-school-aged anemic children living in San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru. We tested for differences in alpha and beta diversity using QIIME 2 and performed differential abundance testing in DESeq2 in R. We ran multivariate regression models to assess associations between abundance of specific taxa and response while controlling for relevant variables in Stata 17.
RESULTS: While we found no evidence for gut microbiota diversity associated with child response to iron treatment, we observed several differential abundance patterns between responders and non-responders at both timepoints. Additionally, we present support for a nonzero relationship between lower relative abundance of Barnesiellaceae and response to iron supplementation in samples collected before and after treatment.
CONCLUSION: While larger studies and more specific approaches are needed to understand the relationship between microbes and anemia in an epidemiological context, this study suggests that investigating nutritional status and pathogen exposure is key to better understanding the gut microbiome and impact of iron fortification.},

 abstract = {In human cooperation, people prefer to choose partners with high willingness and ability-while both are valued by partners, individuals often prioritize willingness. Two event-related potential (ERP) experiments were conducted to discern the neural processes underpinning this preference. In the first experiment, participants made a choice between two potential partners and received feedback on the selected partner's willingness to cooperate. This was followed by feedback on the partner's task performance (ability) or a gambling outcome. In contrast, the second experiment first provided feedback on ability, then presented feedback on willingness or a gambling outcome. This study revealed that a potential partner's willingness trait significantly influences individuals' emotional evaluations and monetary allocations than the ability trait. Electrophysiological data indicated that low-willingness feedback elicited a diminished feedback-related negative (FRN) and an amplified P3 compared to high-willingness feedback. In contrast, no such difference was discernible between high- and low-ability feedback. Moreover, the P3 difference from high versus low willingness was considerably more pronounced than that from gambling outcomes, whereas the difference wave between high and low ability paralleled gambling outcomes. These findings bolster the novel finding that partner willingness may provide more substantial social rewards than ability. Furthermore, this study provides the first ERP evidence of willingness and ability trait perceptions in partner choice decisions.},

 abstract = {This chapter analyses the interaction between microbiota and humans from an evolutionary point of view. Long-term interactions between gut microbiota and host have been generated as a result of dietary choices through coevolutionary processes, where mutuality of advantage is essential. Likewise, the characteristics of the intestinal environment have made it possible to describe different intrahost evolutionary mechanisms affecting microbiota. For its part, the intestinal microbiota has been of great importance in the evolution of mammals, allowing the diversification of dietary niches, phenotypic plasticity and the selection of host phenotypes. Although the origin of the human intestinal microbial community is still not known with certainty, mother-offspring transmission plays a key role, and it seems that transmissibility between individuals in adulthood also has important implications. Finally, it should be noted that certain aspects inherent to modern lifestyle, including refined diets, antibiotic intake, exposure to air pollutants, microplastics, and stress, could negatively affect the diversity and composition of our gut microbiota. This chapter aims to combine current knowledge to provide a comprehensive view of the interaction between microbiota and humans throughout evolution.},

Vice versa, many pathologies have been shown, in turn, to be responsible for alterations in the gut microbiota, a condition that can worsen illness outcomes and response to therapies. For these reasons, great efforts have been made, and studies are still ongoing, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying gut microbiota alterations and to search for pharmacologic or other strategies that can effectively restore the gut microbiota. In this narrative review, we examined the most significant literature on the role of some milk bioactive compounds, such as milk oligosaccharides and whey proteins, in modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and the underlying mechanisms of action, with the aim of investigating the impact of the microbiota changes mediated by these milk bioactive molecules on human health, and their potential use as therapeutics to treat or adjuvate the treatment of gut dysbiosis and associated pathologies.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep undergoes major changes during the first year of life, but the characteristics of sleep among infants in low and middle-income countries are not well documented. This study describes sleep characteristics and changes in sleep patterns in infants at 6 and 12months of age from Bhaktapur, Nepal.
METHODS: This was a community-based longitudinal study comprising 735 infants. Sleep characteristics were obtained by interview with the mother using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaires. The stability of sleep duration and night awakenings were estimated by logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Cosleeping in the parent's bed at 6 and 12months of age was almost universal (>97%). At 6months of age, 254 (35%) and at 12months of age, 341 (46%) infants had a total 24-hour sleep duration <12 hours. Night awakenings >3 times per night were common (65%) both at 6 and 12months of age. Infants with frequent nightly awakenings at 6months had increased odds of frequent nightly awakenings at 12months (OR=2.2; 95% CI: 1.6, 2.9). Very few (<3%) mothers reported sleep problems in their infants at 6 and 12months of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Cosleeping was almost universal among Nepalese infants, and very few of the mothers reported sleep problems in their infants. Infants at 6 and 12months had similar patterns for both sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings. For infants, there were increased odds of having similar sleep duration and nocturnal awakening at 6 and 12months.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Large and giant double-stranded DNA viruses within the phylum Nucleocytoviricota are diverse and prevalent in the environment where they substantially affect the ecology and evolution of eukaryotes 1–4 . Until now, these viruses were only sporadically found in the digestive system of vertebrates 5–7 . Here, we present the identification and genomic characterization of a proposed third order of viruses within the class Pokkesviricetes that currently consists of poxviruse s and asfuviruses 8 . Members of this newly identified order we provisionally named “ Egovirales ” are commonly in the digestive system of vertebrates worldwide and are abundant in >10% of livestock animals, >2% of humans, and wild animals. Egoviruses have linear genomes up to 467 kbp in length and likely form multilayered icosahedral capsids, similar to those of asfuviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of conserved viral genes indicates that egoviruses are the sister group of poxviruses, with implications for capsid evolution. The diversity of egoviruses already far exceeds that of all known poxviruses and animal-associated asfuviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and patterns of virus distribution across vertebrates suggest that egoviruses can be either specialists or generalists associated with a single or multiple vertebrate species, respectively. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association between Egovirales and the human population on the global scale. Egoviruses not only expand the ecological and evolutionary scope of Pokkesviricetes , but also represent the only diverse, widespread, and abundant group of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting eukaryotic cells in the digestive system of vertebrates. },

 abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major endocrinometabolic and reproductive disorder that affects premenopausal women globally. Its typical features include polycystic ovary morphology, hyperandrogenism, chronic inflammation, ano-/oligovulation, metabolic irregularities, and infertility. Studies have shown that the dysfunction—metabolic and reproductive—observed in this condition has a high prevalence in the offspring of the patients. Genetic factors and epigenetic modifications influence the pathophysiology, heritability, and prevalence of PCOS. The human gut microbiome is a multifaceted population of microorganisms that can be regarded as a neuroendocrine “organ.” A normal gut microbiota is critical for health while its dysbiosis has been closely linked to the pathophysiology of PCOS. Reports revealed that gut microbiota-derived metabolites (folate, choline, branched-chain amino acid, short-chain fatty acids) interact with epigenetic modifications and these metabolites exhibit abnormal levels in gut dysbiotic conditions. Hence, this chapter is focused on the intriguing interaction connecting epigenetics and the gut microbiome in PCOS. The impact of dysbiosis and activity of gut metabolites as epigenetic modulators in PCOS highlights a promising area that may reveal important landmarks and risk indicators in the diagnosis and prognosis of PCOS. However, further research is necessary to develop therapeutic and pharmacological targets that will exploit the microbiome-epigenetic cross-talk in PCOS.},

 abstract = {BackgroundElevated FSH often occurs in women of advanced maternal age (AMA, age ≥ 35) and in infertility patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). There is controversy on whether high endogenous FSH contributes to infertility and whether high exogenous FSH adversely impacts patient pregnancy rates.MethodsThe senescence-accelerated mouse-prone-8 (SAMP8) model of female reproductive aging was employed to assess the separate impacts of age and high FSH activity on the percentages (%) of viable and mature ovulated oocytes recovered after gonadotropin treatment. Young and midlife mice were treated with the FSH analog equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) to model both endogenous FSH elevation and exogenous FSH elevation. Previously we showed the activin inhibitor ActRIIB:Fc increases oocyte quality by preventing chromosome and spindle misalignments. Therefore, ActRIIB:Fc treatment was performed in an effort to increase % oocyte viability and % oocyte maturation.ResultsThe high FSH activity of eCG is ootoxic to ovulatory oocytes, with greater decreases in % viable oocytes in midlife than young mice. High FSH activity of eCG potently inhibits oocyte maturation, decreasing the % of mature oocytes to similar degrees in young and midlife mice. ActRIIB:Fc treatment does not prevent eCG ootoxicity, but it restores most oocyte maturation impeded by eCG.ConclusionsFSH ootoxicity to ovulatory oocytes and FSH maturation inhibition pose a paradox given the well-known pro-growth and pro-maturation activities of FSH in the earlier stages of oocyte growth. We propose the FOOT Hypothesis (“FSH OoToxicity Hypothesis), that FSH ootoxicity to ovulatory oocytes comprises a new driver of infertility and low pregnancy success rates in DOR women attempting spontaneous pregnancy and in COS/IUI patients, especially AMA women. We speculate that endogenous FSH elevation also contributes to reduced fecundity in these DOR and COS/IUI patients.Restoration of oocyte maturation by ActRIB:Fc suggests that activin suppresses oocyte maturation in vivo. This contrasts with prior studies showing activin A promotes oocyte maturation in vitro. Improved oocyte maturation with agents that decrease endogenous activin activity with high specificity may have therapeutic benefit for COS/IVF patients, COS/IUI patients, and DOR patients attempting spontaneous pregnancies.},

 abstract = {In classic visual search, observers typically search for the presence of a target in a scene or display. In foraging tasks, there may be multiple targets in the same display (or “patch”). Observers typically search for and collect these target items in one patch until they decide to leave that patch and move to the next one. This is a highly rule-governed behavior. The current study investigated whether these rules are disrupted when the foraging is interrupted in various manners. In Experiment 1, the foraging was briefly interrupted and then resumed in the same patch. In Experiments 2 and 3, the foraging in each patch either ended voluntarily or compulsorily after a fixed amount of time. In these cases, foraging resumed in a patch only after all patches were visited. Overall, the rules of foraging remained largely intact, though Experiment 2 shows that foraging rules can be overridden by the demand characteristics of the task. The results show that participants tended to perform approximately consistently despite interruptions. The results suggest that foraging behavior in a relatively simple foraging environment is resilient and not easily disrupted by interruption.},

Although metagenomic assembly and genome isolation have shed light on the genetic diversity of S. copri, the lack of available isolates from this clade has resulted in a limited understanding of how members' genetic diversity translates into phenotypic diversity. Within the confines of a single gut microbiome, we have isolated 63 strains from diverse lineages of S. copri. We performed comparative analyses that exposed differences in cellular morphologies, preferences in polysaccharide utilization, yield of short-chain fatty acids, and antibiotic resistance across isolates. We further show that exposure to S. copri lineages either evokes strong or muted transcriptional responses in human intestinal epithelial cells. Our study exposes large phenotypic differences within related S. copri isolates, extending this to host-microbe interactions.},

 abstract = {We present the results of the excavations and analyses of the diverse and exceptional archaeological assemblage of Taguatagua 3, a new late Pleistocene site located in the ancient Tagua Tagua lake in Central Chile (34°S). The anthropogenic context is constrained in a coherently dated stratigraphic deposit which adds new information about the mobility, subsistence strategies, and settlement of the early hunter-gatherers of southern South America. The age model constructed, as well as radiocarbon dates obtained directly from a combustion structure, indicate that the human occupation occurred over a brief time span around 12,440-12,550 cal yr BP. Considering taphonomic, geoarchaeological, lithic, archaeobotanical, and zooarchaeological evidence, as well as the spatial distribution combined with ethnographic data, we interpret Taguatagua 3 as a logistic and temporary camp associated mainly with gomphothere hunting and butchering. Nevertheless, several other activities were carried out here as well, such as hide and/or bone preparation, small vertebrate and plant processing and consumption, and red ochre grinding. Botanical and eggshell remains suggest that the anthropic occupation occurred during the dry season. Considering the contemporaneous sites recorded in the basin, we conclude that the ancient Tagua Tagua lake was a key location along the region's early hunter-gatherer mobility circuits. In this context, it acted as a recurrent hunting/scavenging place during the Late Pleistocene due to its abundant, diverse, and predictable resources.},

Therefore, the new argument is to take the perspective of karate as a combat sport, martial art, and self defence system in one. Karate as a combat sport refers to fighting skills in the following directions: traditional, sport and Olympic; and in the following systems: semi contact, knockdown, full contact, mix fighting. Karate as a martial art has a health-promoting character and emphasises the psycho-physical development of practitioners and the recognition of ethical codes. And karate as a self defence system is concerned with proficiency in out-of-sport confrontations, but also in risk assessment. Karate has been found to be an effective means in educating young people to safety, but in order for it to be effective, it needs to be adopted in its entirety. Because the combat sport perspective activates youth in physical culture, the martial art perspective educates according to norms and rules; and the self defence system perspective teaches how to act in difficult situations.},

 abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Endometriosis, characterized by extrauterine endometrial tissue, leads to irregular bleeding and pelvic pain. Menstrual retrograde theory suggests fragments traverse fallopian tubes, causing inflammation and scar tissue. Prevalent among infertile women, risk factors include fewer pregnancies, delayed childbirth, irregular cycles, and familial predisposition. Treatments, medication, and surgery entail side effects. Studies link gut microbiota alterations to endometriosis, necessitating research to establish causation. We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the potential link between endometriosis and gut microbiota through genetic variants. <b>Methods:</b> Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyzed gut microbiota's potential causal effects on endometriosis. Instrumental variables, robustly associated with exposures, leveraged GWAS data from MiBioGen for gut microbiota and FinnGen R8 release for endometriosis. SNPs strongly associated with exposures were instrumental variables. Rigorous assessments ensured SNP impact scrutiny on endometriosis. <b>Results:</b> At the genus level, <i>Anaerotruncus</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Haemophilus</i>, and <i>Holdemania</i> showed causal association with endometriosis. Specific gut microbiota exhibited causal effects on different endometriosis stages. <i>Holdemania</i> and Ruminococcaceae <i>UCG002</i> exerted reversible, stage-specific impacts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Mendelian randomization provides evidence for the causal link between specific gut microbiotas and endometriosis, emphasizing the pivotal role of gut microbiota dysbiosis. Modulating gut microbiota emerges as a promising strategy for preventing and treating endometriosis.},

 abstract = {The Yanomami are one of the oldest indigenous tribes in the Amazon and are direct descendants of the first people to colonize South America 12,000 years ago. They are located on the border between Venezuela and Brazil, with the Venezuelan side remaining uncontacted. While they maintain a hunter-gatherer society, they are currently experiencing contact with urbanized populations in Brazil. The human gut microbiota of traditional communities has become the subject of recent studies due to the Westernization of their diet and the introduction of antibiotics and other chemicals, which have affected microbial diversity in indigenous populations, thereby threatening their existence. In this study, we preliminarily characterized the diversity of the gut microbiota of the Yanomami, a hunter-gatherer society from the Amazon, experiencing contact with urbanized populations. Similarly, we compared their diversity with the population in Manaus, Amazonas. A metabarcoding approach of the 16 S rRNA gene was carried out on fecal samples. Differences were found between the two populations, particularly regarding the abundance of genera (e.g., Prevotella and Bacteroides) and the higher values of the phyla Bacteroidetes over Firmicutes, which were significant only in the Yanomami. Some bacteria were found exclusively in the Yanomami (Treponema and Succinivibrio). However, diversity was statistically equal between them. In conclusion, the composition of the Yanomami gut microbiota still maintains the profile characteristic of a community with a traditional lifestyle. However, our results suggest an underlying Westernization process of the Yanomami microbiota when compared with that of Manaus, which must be carefully monitored by authorities, as the loss of diversity can be a sign of growing danger to the health of the Yanomami.},

 abstract = {Abstract The rapid increase in genomes and metagenomic data presents major scalability and efficiency challenges for current metagenomic profilers. In response, we introduce MetaKSSD, which redefines reference taxonomic marker database (MarkerDB) construction and metagenomic profiling using sketch operations, offering efficiency improvements by orders of magnitude. MetaKSSD encompasses 85,202 species in its MarkerDB using just 0.17GB of storage and profiles 10GB of data within seconds, utilizing only 0.5GB of memory. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrated that MetaKSSD is among the top-performing profilers across various metrics. In a microbiome-phenotype association study, MetaKSSD identified significantly more effective associations than MetaPhlAn4. We profiled 382,016 metagenomic runs using MetaKSSD, conducted extensive sample clustering analyses, and suggested potential yet-to-be-discovered niches. Additionally, we developed functionality in MetaKSSD for instantaneous searching among large-scale profiles. The client-server architecture of MetaKSSD allows the swift transmission of metagenome sketches over the network and enables real-time online metagenomic analysis, facilitating use by non-expert users.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism, facilitating nutrient absorption, and supporting immune function, thereby assisting the host in adapting to seasonal dietary changes. Here, we compare the gut microbiome composition of wild gray snub-nosed monkeys during winter (from October to December) and spring (from January to March) to understand differences in seasonal nutrient intake patterns. Snub-nosed monkeys are foregut fermenters and consume difficult-to-digest carbohydrates and lichen. To examine the digestive adaptations of gray snub-nosed monkeys, we collected 14 fresh fecal samples for DNA analysis during the winter and spring. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and functional metagenomic analyses, we identified that Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes constitute a keystone bacterial group in the gut microbiota during winter and spring and are responsible for degrading cellulose. Moreover, the transition in dietary composition from winter to spring was accompanied by changes in gut microbiota composition, demonstrating adaptive responses to varying food sources and availability. In winter, the bacterial species of the genera <i>Streptococcus</i> were found in higher abundance. At the functional level, these bacteria are involved in fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism c-related pathways, which facilitate the breakdown of glycogen, starch, and fiber found in fruits, seeds, and mature leaves. During spring, there was an increased abundance of bacteria species from the <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> genera, which aid the digestion of protein-rich buds. Combined, these findings reveal how the gut microbiota adjusts to fluctuations in energy balance and nutrient intake across different seasons in this critically endangered species. Moreover, we also identified <i>Pseudomonas</i> in two samples; the presence of potential pathogens within the gut could pose a risk to other troop members. Our findings highlight the necessity of a conservation plan that focuses on protecting vegetation and implementing measures to prevent disease transmission for this critically endangered species.},

@article{pub.1173874231,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Locomotion activities are part of most human daily tasks and are the basis for subsistence activities, particularly for hunter-gatherers. Therefore, differences in speed walking-related variables may have an effect, not only on the mobility of the group, but also on its composition. Some anthropometric parameters related to body length could affect walking speed-related variables and contribute to different human behaviors. However, there is currently little information on the influence of these parameters in nonadult individuals.
METHODS: Overall, 11 females and 17 male child/adolescents, 8-17 years of age, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. Five different pace walking tests were performed on a treadmill to calculate the optimal locomotion speed (OLS) and U-shaped relationship between the walking energy expenditure and speed (χ<sup>2</sup> cost of transport [CoT]) (i.e., energetic walking flexibility).
RESULTS: The mean OLS was 3.05 ± 0.13 miles per hour (mph), with no differences between sexes. Similarly, there were no sex differences in walking flexibility according to the χ<sup>2</sup> CoT. Body height (p &lt; .0001) and femur length (p &lt; .001) were positively correlated with χ<sup>2</sup> CoT; however, female child/adolescents mitigated the effect of height and femur length when walking at suboptimal speeds.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with prior observations in adults, our findings suggest that anthropometric parameters related to body stature are associated with reduced suboptimal walking flexibility in children and adolescents. Taken together, these results suggest that children and adolescents can adapt their pace to the one of taller individuals without a highly energetic penalty, but this flexibility decreases with increasing body size.},
