 abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Culturally driven marital practices provide a key instance of an interaction between social and genetic processes in shaping patterns of human genetic variation, producing, for example, increased identity by descent through consanguineous marriage. A commonly used measure to quantify identity by descent in an individual is the inbreeding coefficient, a quantity that reflects not only consanguinity, but also other aspects of kinship in the population to which the individual belongs. Here, in populations worldwide, we examine the relationship between genomic estimates of the inbreeding coefficient and population patterns in genetic variation.
METHODS: Using genotypes at 645 microsatellites, we compare inbreeding coefficients from 5,043 individuals representing 237 populations worldwide to demographic consanguinity frequency estimates available for 26 populations as well as to other quantities that can illuminate population-genetic influences on inbreeding coefficients.
RESULTS: We observe higher inbreeding coefficient estimates in populations and geographic regions with known high levels of consanguinity or genetic isolation and in populations with an increased effect of genetic drift and decreased genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. For the small number of populations with specific consanguinity estimates, we find a correlation between inbreeding coefficients and consanguinity frequency (r = 0.349, p = 0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the importance of both consanguinity and population-genetic factors in influencing variation in inbreeding coefficients, and they provide insight into factors useful for assessing the effect of consanguinity on genomic patterns in different populations.},

It was demonstrated that Hadza and Datoga people differed in the structural organization of one of the 5-HTTL alleles (extra long allele xL). Analysis of the allele length polymorphism of both genes showed that in the Hadza and Datoga samples examined, variation parameters, as well as the genotype and allele frequency distribution pattern were almost the same. At the same time, analysis of the SNP polymorphism at the A/G substitutions of the 5-HTTL locus revealed a substantial decrease of the active allele LA frequency in the population of Hadza compared to the population of Datoga (χ2 = 3.77; d.f. = 1; p = 0.052).},

Here we review various approaches to this material. In particular we focus on how the history of research on these industries has changed dramatically from the earliest investigations in East Africa through the last thirty years and finally we describe the approaches found in the volume. This volume is distinct in its incorporation of many industries that would not classically be considered Oldowan, and subsequently provides a unique perspective on early stone tool manufacture and use. In particular the conceptual framework around the evolution of different technical skills provides a major theoretical step in constructing models of early hominin behavioral evolution. Although this chapter reviews the material found in each of the chapters of this volume it does not reiterate the information found in these chapters. Rather we provide a conceptual perspective for the various themes that link the contributions together. We identify the challenges for future Oldowan research. We see the synthesis of different schools of thought in the study of Oldowan stone artifacts as one of the most important contributions that future work can make for the study of the earliest technologies.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the spatial and temporal dimensions of knapping routines through analysis of refit data. Many reconstructions of lithic tool production utilising refit data concentrate upon 'how' a piece of stone is taken apart, and less often consider the 'when' and 'where'. Lower Palaeolithic artefacts are frequently viewed as belonging to simplistic technical systems in which tools were made and used as and when required, showing little temporal depth. Modern knappers can replicate the components of the Acheulean toolkit, such as a biface, in around 15 minutes. The predominant use of local raw materials and the relatively simple reduction sequences observed on many Middle Pleistocene sites has given rise to the view that Acheulean hominins possessed an immediate approach to technology, and that artefacts did not stay in the technological system very long. In contrast, other researchers have stressed the increased planning abilities of hominins in relation to their stone tool-making and using routines. Increased planning abilities are often cited as a diagnostic feature of modern human cognition. As such, tracing the emergence of these abilities is an important avenue of research in human evolution. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the process of lithic production was organised on several Middle Pleistocene sites in northwest Europe. By comparing refitting sequences from several primary context sites, the different stages of reduction present at these locations can be reconstructed. Since refit sets record the work carried out in one place and time by an individual, they can be used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal dimension of these past technological activities. The analysis shows fragmentation of reduction sequences was a common occurrence, suggesting a more dynamic approach to tool-making and using activities than has previously been recognised. The analysis provides a description of these artefact dynamics, and discusses the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this behaviour.},

 abstract = {In a biochemical and physiological sense man is not a particularly “modern” animal. Rather, he shares many adaptive mechanisms which were already established several million years ago during the lower Pleistocene era in early homonids, most of which were predominantly herbivorous (26, 46, 52, 57), as is the case today. The manifold physiochemical functions of dietary fiber in human digestive and excretory processes certainly did not develop de novo in man, but were common to all higher primates and many other monogastric terrestrial vertebrates as well (6, 34). These processes and the basic architecture of the gastrointestinal tract quite probably evolved over several hundred thousand generations in response to the continuous, selective pressures of a broadly based but consistently phytic diet (17, 19, 39). It is now apparent that during the last 20,000 years, the human diet has undergone a series of far reaching “revolutions,” the overall trend of which has been away from a coarse, plant-based regime of foraged leafy greens, seeds, stalks, roots, flowers, and other tissues, to a more limited, often monotypic, diet based primarily on a few cereal grains, tubers, and legumes (Figure 1). The importance of the former diet, that of the hunter-gatherer, in shaping the structure and function of the human gastrointestinal tract can hardly be overestimated.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Humanly induced modifications on human and non-human bones from four archaeological sites of known funerary rituals (one interpreted as cannibalism and three interpreted as funerary defleshing and disarticulation after a period of decay) were analyzed to ascertain whether macromorphological and micromorphological characteristics of cut marks can be used to distinguish cannibalistic from secondary burial practices.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four collections were analyzed: the Magdalenian assemblage from Gough's Cave (UK) and the Mesolithic-Neolithic bone samples from Lepenski Vir, Padina and Vlasac (Serbia). A total of 647 cut marks (345 on human and 302 on non-human remains) were imaged and measured using an optical surface measurement system, the Alicona InfiniteFocus, housed at the Natural History Museum (London, UK).
RESULTS: The frequency of cut marks at Gough's Cave exceeds 65%, while it is below 1% in the Serbian sites, and no human tooth marks and only one case of percussion damage have been observed on the three Serbian collections. The distribution of cut marks on human bones is comparable in the four assemblages. Cannibalized human remains, however, present a uniform cut mark distribution, which can be associated with disarticulation of persistent and labile articulations, and the scalping and filleting of muscles. For secondary burials where modification occurred after a period of decay, disarticulation marks are less common and the disarticulation of labile joints is rare. The micromorphometric analyses of cut marks on human and non-human remains suggest that cut marks produced when cleaning partially decayed bodies are significantly different from cut marks produced during butchery of fresh bodies.
CONCLUSIONS: A distinction between cannibalism and secondary treatment of human bodies can be made based on frequency, distribution and micromorphometric characteristics of cut marks.},

 abstract = {This chapter examines Hong Kong Neolithic site data with the site catchment analysis approach, in order to help reveal the subsistence nature of this region during the period under study. Based on a recheck of some original literature of the site catchment analysis and key materials on local historical, economic and ecological developments including site location, distance between sites and resources, characteristics of environments, nature of subsistence activities, technological levels, cultural/economic traditions and social interactions of the region and related areas, supported by unearthed archaeological evidences and scientific results, a couple of proposals are put forth hereinafter: (1) A dichotomy between a primary site catchment and a secondary site catchment is made, so that the catchment (particularly the subsistence resources) of a site can be better understood. The typical 5-km radius catchment zone for farmers or 10-km radius catchment zone for foragers is in nature equivalent to the primary site catchment which is basically of a subsistence nature, as this chapter has suggested. (2) The 5-km/10-km radii are largely the maximum limits of radius distance for the forager/farmer catchments in theory. And in reality, the radii are usually much smaller and often varied, due to ecological differences and other factors. (3) A preliminary 1-km radius site catchment zone, where the most basic or regular subsistence resources regardless of terrestrial or aquatic ones were drawn, is proposed for the Neolithic sites of Hong Kong, incapable of revealing possible fluctuations of site catchment size from the Middle to the Late Neolithic though. (4) Through primary site catchment analyses from both regional perspective and individual site perspective, this chapter suggests that, during the Neolithic in Hong Kong, procuring aquatic (i.e. marine or estuary riverine) resources would have been a major subsistence activity, probably coupled with plant or animal foraging even cultivation (e.g. tubers and rice). (5) From the late phase of the Middle Neolithic to the Late Neolithic, more headland and upland or inland sites were present and more site catchment zones were overlapping or closely situated, which would have probably resulted from increase of population and sedentism plus political or social interactions between neighbouring groups, indicating possible expansion and intensification of food procurement and exploitation, or competition of broad-spectrum subsistence resources. It is likely that both aquatic (especially marine) and land food demands may have been increasing simultaneously, most obviously during the late phase of the Late Neolithic. (6) Overall, the site catchment analysis approach can at least help archaeologists to locate a reasonable hypothesis to stick to or lean to in their studies and more so when checked against or backed up by sound archaeological findings and/or other lines’ research outcomes, for example, local environmental history.},

The objective of this paper is to characterize and compare the bone modification patterns on small vertebrate skeletal parts produced by two native South American carnivores, the Pampas fox and the Geoffroy's cat. To accomplish this, an experimental study was conducted at a local zoo, where each predator was routinely offered 10 domestic rabbits. The results of the non-ingested remains are presented, including the anatomical representation and the fracture patterns. The results indicate that both the Geoffroy's cat and the Pampas fox generate significant bone destruction on rabbit remains, which impacts directly on the representation of individuals. Elements with greater survival rates include the long bones, innominate, cranium and mandible. In addition, bone density was found to be a factor which determines the differential destruction of elements. While our results cannot distinguish the patterns generated by these two species of carnivorous, observed modifications provide new data to help distinguish these assemblages from those caused by other predators such as diurnal and nocturnal birds.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe human intestinal microbiota is an adaptive entity, being capable of adjusting its phylogenetic and functional profile in response to changes in diet, lifestyle and environment. Providing the host with functions important to regulate energetic homeostasis and immunological function, the gut microbiota is strategic to keep metabolic and immunological homeostasis during the entire lifespan.Scope and approachIn the present work we review studies exploring human gut microbiota variations at different age, describing the trajectory of ecosystem changes during the course of our life, from infancy to the old age. Gut microbiota variation mirroring subsistence strategy is also explored, with a particular focus on how the gut microbiota changes in response to modifications in the diet. Finally, we illustrate how an abnormal dietary intake could force microbiota to an obese-associated configuration, which concurs in compromising the host metabolic homeostasis.Key findings and conclusionsOur work allows appreciating the importance of the physiological flexibility conferred by the microbiota for modulating our metabolic and immunological phenotype along the course of our life. Further, the key role of the gut microbiota in providing an extra means of adaptive potential during our evolutionary history is highlighted, suggesting the importance of the intestinal microbiota-host interplay for the maintenance of human health and homeostasis in changing environments. On the other hand, different lifestyle and dietary factors, such as sanitization and antibiotic usage or high-fat diet, can force maladaptive changes in the microbiota configuration which could have negative effects on human health. Thus, it is important to modulate diet and lifestyle habits to keep a mutualistic gut microbiota layout along the course of our life.},

 abstract = {Summary
                  The occurrence of fires in many types of woodland and forested environments would have benefited human populations in several different ways. In addition to greatly increasing the mobility of the human groups, the occurrence of fire in many types of forest would have led to substantial improvements in the economic potential of the environment. Improvements in both the quantity and nutritional quality of the food supplies available to herbivorous animals would have increased not only the total carrying capacity of the environment for these species, but also the relative growth-rates and reproductive rate of the animals. In certain cases it is likely that burning would have increased the overall ‘productivity’ of ungulate populations by a factor of × 10. Similar improvements may have been achieved in the yields of certain vegetable food resources. The potential impact of these environmental changes on the population numbers and settlement patterns of human communities is discussed, and it is suggested that the adoption of systematic policies of forest burning by hunting and gathering populations may have led in certain situations to the emergence of more complex patterns of man-animal relationships which were closely similar to those of traditional ‘herding’ or ‘pastoralist’ economies.},

All of the assemblages are characterized by significant density-mediated biases, yet in situ attrition played a minimal role in assemblage formation. In contrast, the survivorship of hare (Lepus capensis) skeletons is not mediated by bone density indicating that different prey taxa experienced independent taphonomic histories. Both gazelle cortical and cancellous bone is highly fragmented and the degree of fragmentation and survivorship are strongly correlated with fat yields. Results of multiple tests point to intensive marrow and grease extraction as the primary determinant of gazelle bone survivorship. Although gazelle carcasses were intensively utilized throughout the Epipalaeolithic, the intensity of use is stable across the duration of the period.},

Contemporary examples are given for each model, and each is then divided between ‘nativist’ and ‘anti-nativist’ versions. After the strengths and weaknesses of each model are highlighted, an alternative model is proposed, which is an ‘anti-nativist’ version of the Output model that is called the ‘Direct Outgrowth’ model. That model construes moral norms as being directly shaped by innate dispositions such as emotional preparedness. However, despite the central role played by innate dispositions, none of those dispositions evolved for the purpose of morality, which is why the model is still described as ‘anti-nativist’.},

 abstract = {Traditional interpretations of hominid carcass acquisition strategies revolve around the debate over whether early hominids hunted or scavenged. A popular version of the scavenging scenario is the carnivore-hominid-carnivore hypothesis, which argues that hominids acquired animal resources primarily through passive opportunistic scavenging from felid-defleshed carcasses. Its main empirical support comes from the analysis of tooth mark frequency and distribution at the FLK Zinj site reported by Blumenschine (Blumenschine, 1995, J. Hum. Evol. 29, 21-51), in which it was shown that long bone mid-shafts exhibited a high frequency of tooth marks, only explainable if felids had preceded hominids in carcass defleshing. The present work shows that previous estimates of tooth marks on the FLK Zinj assemblage were artificially high, since natural biochemical marks were mistaken for tooth marks. Revised estimates are similar to those obtained in experiments in which hyenas intervene after humans in bone modification. Furthermore, analyses of percussion marks, notches, and breakage patterns provide data which are best interpreted as the results of hominid activity (hammerstone percussion and marrow extraction), based on experimentally-derived referential frameworks. These multiple lines of evidence support previous analyses of cut marks and their anatomical distribution; all indicate that hominids had early access to fleshed carcasses that were transported, processed, and accumulated at the FLK Zinj site.},

 abstract = {It is argued here that faunal analysts should count soft skeletal parts (such as the articular ends of limb bones) as well as hard parts (such as limb bone shaft fragments). If soft parts are not counted, it is impossible to assess and correct for density-mediated attrition, and inaccurate parameter estimates result. This argument is supported by computer simulations showing that the method of abcml (analysis of bone counts by maximum likelihood) yields much more accurate estimates when articular ends are counted than when they are not. This is not merely the result of more being better than less, for even worse results were obtained from simulations with a hypothetical skeleton in which all skeletal parts are as hard as the hardest shaft fragment. Because these bones do not vary in hardness, their counts are devoid of information about attrition. The estimates that result are biased, with broad confidence intervals. Accurate estimates require that archaeologists count soft bones as well as hard ones.},

 abstract = {The role of humans in the formation of Gravettian mammoth bone accumulations of central and eastern Europe is a heavily debated topic. Grub-Kranawetberg, a multi-layered Gravettian open-air site in eastern Austria, yielded a bone accumulation in the vicinity of a campsite. Zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and spatial analyses of this assemblage offer evidence on both human subsistence and formation of mammoth bone accumulations. The deposit is dominated by Mammuthus primigenius but also includes Coelodonta antiquitatis, Rangifer tarandus, Equus sp., Megaloceros giganteus, Canis lupus, Ursus cf. arctos and Lepus cf. timidus. The presence of butchery marks on remains of both megafaunal taxa indicates a human accumulated assemblage. The absence of carnivore gnaw marks suggests that humans had primary access to meaty skeletal parts. An indication that humans occupying the adjacent campsite interacted with the bones is seen in the rearticulation of a left upper first molar of a mammoth from the campsite with its matching right first upper molar found in the bone accumulation. The deposit is further characterized by various indications of fire evident in lenses of burned sediment and abundant traces of heating faunal remains. The varied colours of burned bone, as well as reddish burned loess show that the accumulation was subjected to a wide range of fire temperatures. The current results argue for the intentional use of fire as waste removal strategy.},

 abstract = {Determining the diet of an extinct species is paramount in any attempt to reconstruct its paleoecology. Because the distribution and mechanical properties of food items may impact postcranial, cranial, mandibular, and dental morphologies related to their procurement, ingestion, and mastication, these anatomical attributes have been studied intensively. However, while mechanical environments influence skeletal and dental features, it is not clear to what extent they dictate particular morphologies. Although biomechanical explanations have been widely applied to extinct hominins in attempts to retrodict dietary proclivities, morphology may say as much about what they were capable of eating, and perhaps more about phylogenetic history, than about the nature of the diet. Anatomical attributes may establish boundary limits, but direct evidence left by the foods that were actually (rather than hypothetically) consumed is required to reconstruct diet. Dental microwear and the stable light isotope chemistry of tooth enamel provide such evidence, and are especially powerful when used in tandem. We review the foundations for microwear and biogeochemistry in diet reconstruction, and discuss this evidence for six early hominin species (Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus anamensis, Au. afarensis, Au. africanus, Paranthropus robustus, and P. boisei). The dietary signals derived from microwear and isotope chemistry are sometimes at odds with inferences from biomechanical approaches, a potentially disquieting conundrum that is particularly evident for several species.},

 abstract = {It is an ongoing interdisciplinary pursuit to identify the factors shaping the emergence and maintenance of tool technology. Field studies of several primate taxa have shown that tool using behaviors vary within and between populations. While similarity in tools over spatial and temporal scales may be the product of socially learned skills, it may also reflect adoption of convergent strategies that are tailored to specific prey features. Much has been claimed about regional variation in chimpanzee tool use, with little attention to the ecological circumstances that may have shaped such differences. This study examines chimpanzee tool use in termite gathering to evaluate the extent to which the behavior of insect prey may dictate chimpanzee technology. More specifically, we conducted a systematic comparison of chimpanzee tool use and termite prey between the Goualougo Triangle in the Republic of Congo and the La Belgique research site in southeast Cameroon. Apes at both of these sites are known to use tool sets to gather several species of termites. We collected insect specimens and measured the characteristics of their nests. Associated chimpanzee tool assemblages were documented at both sites and video recordings were conducted in the Goualougo Triangle. Although Macrotermitinae assemblages were identical, we found differences in the tools used to gather these termites. Based on measurements of the chimpanzee tools and termite nests at each site, we concluded that some characteristics of chimpanzee tools were directly related to termite nest structure. While there is a certain degree of uniformity within approaches to particular tool tasks across the species range, some aspects of regional variation in hominoid technology are likely adaptations to subtle environmental differences between populations or groups. Such microecological differences between sites do not negate the possibility of cultural transmission, as social learning may be required to transmit specific behaviors among individuals.},

At the same time other language families were identified around the world, also on the basis of shared similarities. During the twentieth century historical work continued on these families, but little advancement in linguistic taxonomy occurred, except in the work of Joseph Greenberg, who proposed sweeping classifications, first of African languages, and later of New Guinea, the New World, and Eurasia. Though these classifications have been a subject of controversy, the African classification, at least, has come to be the consensus view, and the classification of New World languages has found independent support from studies of human genetics. During the past two decades there has been renewed interest in deeper classifications, that is, in more ancient language families. Russian scholars have proposed a Nostratic family that would include Indo-European as one branch, as well as a Dene-Caucasian family that includes several previously unclassified languages and families. In addition, the question of monogenesis of extant languages has once again become a topic of discussion.},

 abstract = {Recent theoretical progress potentially refutes past claims that paleodemographic estimations are flawed by statistical problems, including age mimicry and sample bias due to differential preservation. The life expectancy at age 15 of the Jomon period prehistoric populace in Japan was initially estimated to have been ∼16 years while a more recent analysis suggested 31.5 years. In this study, we provide alternative results based on a new methodology. The material comprises 234 mandibular canines from Jomon period skeletal remains and a reference sample of 363 mandibular canines of recent-modern Japanese. Dental pulp reduction is used as the age-indicator, which because of tooth durability is presumed to minimize the effect of differential preservation. Maximum likelihood estimation, which theoretically avoids age mimicry, was applied. Our methods also adjusted for the known pulp volume reduction rate among recent-modern Japanese to provide a better fit for observations in the Jomon period sample. Without adjustment for the known rate in pulp volume reduction, estimates of Jomon life expectancy at age 15 were dubiously long. However, when the rate was adjusted, the estimate results in a value that falls within the range of modern hunter-gatherers, with significantly better fit to the observations. The rate-adjusted result of 32.2 years more likely represents the true life expectancy of the Jomon people at age 15, than the result without adjustment. Considering ∼7% rate of antemortem loss of the mandibular canine observed in our Jomon period sample, actual life expectancy at age 15 may have been as high as ∼35.3 years.},

 abstract = {It has been hypothesized that plant underground storage organs (USOs) played key roles in the initial hominin colonization of savanna habitats, the development of the distinctive skull and tooth morphology of the genus Australopithecus, and the evolution of the genus Homo by serving as "fallback foods" exploited during periods of food shortage. These hypotheses have been tested mostly by morphological, isotopic, and microwear analyses of hominin bones and teeth. Archaeological evidence of USO digging technology is equivocal. Until now relevant data from studies of chimpanzees, useful in behavioral models of early hominins because of their phylogenetic proximity and anatomical similarities, have been lacking. Here we report on the first evidence of chimpanzees using tools to dig for USOs, suggesting that exploitation of such resources was within the cognitive and technological reach of the earliest hominins. Consistent with scenarios of hominin adaptation to savannas, these data come from Ugalla (Tanzania), one of the driest, most open and seasonal chimpanzee habitats. USOs are, however, exploited during the rainy season, well after the period of most likely food shortage, contradicting the specific prediction of fallback food hypotheses. The discovery that savanna chimpanzees use tools to obtain USOs contradicts yet another claim of human uniqueness and provides a model for the study of variables influencing USO use among early hominins.},

 abstract = {There is a long tradition of neotaphonomic research in paleontology and archaeology that is intended for building models of the bone-accumulating and -modifying behaviors of prehistoric biological actors. Building on that tradition, we present new data comparing the ways by which wild and captive leopards (Panthera pardus) altered the meat-bearing long limb bones of small bovids on which they fed. Compared to wild leopards, a captive leopard created more than twice as many tooth marks per skeletal element. In addition, the captive leopard imparted much more intensive gross damage to bones than did wild leopards—including complete consumption of some bones or deletion of bone portions (especially epiphyses) and extensive fragmentation of diaphyses. We attribute the stark divergence of taphonomic results in the bone samples formed by wild and captive leopards to environmental variability: the wild samples were modified by leopards operating in systems characterized by low to moderate feeding competition; the captive sample was created by a leopard operating in the complete absence of feeding competition but (unlike the wild leopards) was also subjected to the tedium of confinement—a condition that prompted repeated and prolonged bouts of chewing beyond what was required to simply extract nutrients from bones. The variable condition of the two bone samples also represents opposing endpoints of leopard taphonomic potential—the wild sample reflecting minimal expected alteration and the captive sample reflecting maximal expected alteration. Neither endpoint serves as accurate proxy for expectations of the taphonomic alteration of small bovid bones by leopards operating in a natural setting that is characterized by moderate to high feeding competition, such as Tanzania's modern Serengeti ecosystem or that reconstructed for most African Pliocene and Pleistocene habitats. Our results do, however, reinforce the conclusions of a previous study comparing taphonomic patterns created by wild and captive lions (P. leo)—that environmental context is a key variable to control if the analyst's goal is to produce the most scientifically realistic and usefully applicable models of the bone-accumulating and -modifying behaviors of prehistoric biological actors.},

Flexible joint dependence on animal and plant foods, establishment of home bases, food sharing, and differentiation of the subsistence activities of the sexes, together constitute an integrated behavioural complex already partly established some two million years ago. Large animals are certainly represented in Lower Pleistocene food refuse; they become commoner in the Middle Pleistocene, when evidence for effective co‐operative large‐scale hunting also first occurs.

Integrating these models with Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness, we predict that the interaction of biological kinship with the age-schedule of resource production should be a key driver of intergenerational transfers. In the empirical case of Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, we provide a detailed characterization of net transfers of food according to age, sex, kinship and the net need of donors and recipients. We show that parents, grandparents and siblings provide significant net downward transfers of food across generations. We demonstrate that the extent of provisioning responds facultatively to variation in the productivity and demographic composition of families, as predicted by the theory. We hypothesize that the motivation to provide these critical transfers is a fundamental force that binds together human nuclear and extended families. The ubiquity of three-generational families in human societies may thus be a direct reflection of fundamental evolutionary constraints on an organism's life-history and social organization. },

 abstract = {There are many types of evidence that provide information about methods for obtaining animal nutrients. Several researchers suggest that the main element to be considered is the skeletal representation of the different species identified in the faunal assemblage. This element must be associated to the animals’ age at death and the localisation of processing marks of the carcasses (both those of anthropic origin and those produced by carnivores). Occasionally, these marks coincide on the same point of the bone, giving cause for overlapping marks. These marks can be considered an aid more to identify the anthropic manner for obtaining animal recourses. However, these cases are very unusual at archaeological sites, and it is not always easy to identify which of the two predators has obtained the prey first. Through the experimental process presented in this article, we have observed diagnostic elements on overlapping marks that show the action sequence of the predators (hominids and carnivores) on carcasses. These experimental criteria were applied to different archaeological sites of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene in the Iberian Peninsula: Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain) and level TD10-1 and TD6-2 of Gran Dolina (Atapuerca, Burgos). In these assemblages, we were able to distinguish hunting and scavenging events through overlapping marks, providing a new element to the general interpretation of these sites.},

 abstract = {Diet has been known to play an important role in human health since at least the time period of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. In the last decade, research has revealed that microorganisms inhabiting the digestive tract, known as the gut microbiota, are critical factors in human health. This paper draws on concepts of cooperation and conflict from ecology and evolutionary biology to make predictions about host-microbiota interactions involving nutrients. To optimally extract energy from some resources (e.g., fiber), hosts require cooperation from microbes. Other nutrients can be utilized by both hosts and microbes (e.g., simple sugars, iron) in their ingested form, which may lead to greater conflict over these resources. This framework predicts that some negative health effects of foods are driven by the direct effects of these foods on human physiology and by indirect effects resulting from microbiome-host competition and conflict (e.g., increased invasiveness and inflammation). Similarly, beneficial effects of some foods on host health may be enhanced by resource sharing and other cooperative behaviors between host and microbes that may downregulate inflammation and virulence. Given that some foods cultivate cooperation between hosts and microbes while others agitate conflict, host-microbe interactions may be novel targets for interventions aimed at improving nutrition and human health.},

 abstract = {Human arrival in Sahul – Pleistocene Australia and New Guinea – has long been argued as the catalyst in the decline and disappearance of a suite of extinct animals referred to as megafauna. The debate concerning causality in Sahul is highly polarised, with climate change often cited as the alternative explanatory model. On continental Australia, there are few datasets available with which to explore the likely processes leading to the extinction events. At the present time, there is one site in New Guinea (Nombe Rockshelter) and one on continental Australia (Cuddie Springs) where the coexistence and temporal overlap of humans and megafauna has been identified. The Cuddie Springs Pleistocene archaeological site in southeastern Australia contains an association of fossil extinct and extant fauna with an archaeological record through two sequential stratigraphic units dating from c. 36 to c. 30ka ago. A taphonomic study of the fossil fauna has revealed an accumulation of bone in a primary depositional context, consistent with a waterhole death assemblage. Overall the faunal assemblage studied here (n: 8146; NISP: 1355) has yielded little direct evidence of carnivore damage or human activities. Post depositional factors such as physical destruction incurred by trampling, compaction of sediments, and/or the hydrological status of the lake at that time have played important roles. As the only known site on continental Australia where megafauna and humans co-occur, the Cuddie Springs faunal assemblage yields equivocal evidence for a significant human role in the accumulation of the fauna here. At the present time there is no evidential basis to the argument that humans had a primary role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna. The first colonisers are likely to have preyed upon those few species known to have persisted to this time, but their impact may have been restricted to the tail end of a process that had been underway for millennia prior to human arrival.},

 abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is key for the study of the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, as well as for the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans (AMH). On this subject, the most widespread misconception assumed that both human species coexisted during a certain period of time, after which Homo sapiens imposed on Neanderthals who finally got extinct. However, recent proposals based on improved dating methods, discuss this possibility, arguing that the arrival of AMH was marked by the complete absence of Homo neanderthalensis in this territory. In that way, new theories deny the possibility of coexistence and the disappearance of Neanderthals by cultural displacement. Covalejos Cave (Velo, Pielagos, Cantabria), one of the few settlements in the northern Peninsula with Final Mousterian and Early Aurignacian levels, supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, in this paper, we try to avoid a direct discussion about this question in order to centre our analysis on identifying possible different subsistence strategies between H. neanderthalensis and anatomically modern humans in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Our zooarchaeological and taphonomic studies reflect that Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans exploited the same faunal species, pointing out that there does not seem to be significant differences in their behaviour in Covalejos Cave.},

 abstract = {Pilot experiments involving the butchering of bird carcasses and the use of non-retouched flint flakes were performed. The executed actions comprised skinning and defeathering various avifaunal species (Circaetus gallicus and Gyps fulvus). The main aim of this experimental programme was to document the use-wear on flint implements employed in the treatment of the avifaunal carcasses in order to help researchers identify this activity in the archaeological record. An additional focus of this study concerned the experimental organic residues (soft tissue and feathers) associated with the bird species used in the experiments. For each residue type, a detailed chemical elemental analysis and morphological characterisation were performed, with the aim of creating an experimental database for comparison with the micro-residues that will potentially be found on archaeological stone tools. For microscopic observations, we employed both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Light Microscopy (OLM). A detailed description of the use-wear features and residue types was achieved through a systematic comparison of micrographs taken with both techniques. In addition, EDS (energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy) was applied to determine the elemental composition of the residues. Taphonomic analysis of the bones of the carcasses used in the experimental programme was performed with the principal aim of comparing the distribution of cut marks on bones with the use-wear pattern on the lithic implements employed. Future developments of our research will improve the methodology by expanding the experimental programme and by applying it to archaeological collections (at sites where the processing of these kinds of animals has already been identified).},

 abstract = {The Bantu languages are widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Genetic research supports linguists and historians who argue that migration played an important role in the spread of this language family, but the genetic data also indicates a more complex process involving substantial gene flow with resident populations. In order to understand the Bantu expansion process in east Africa, mtDNA hypervariable region I variation in 352 individuals from the Taita and Mijikenda ethnic groups was analyzed, and we evaluated the interactions that took place between the Bantu- and non-Bantu-speaking populations in east Africa. The Taita and Mijikenda are Bantu-speaking agropastoralists from southeastern Kenya, at least some of whose ancestors probably migrated into the area as part of Bantu migrations that began around 3,000 BCE. Our analyses indicate that they show some distinctive differences that reflect their unique cultural histories. The Taita are genetically more diverse than the Mijikenda with larger estimates of genetic diversity. The Taita cluster with other east African groups, having high frequencies of haplogroups from that region, while the Mijikenda have high frequencies of central African haplogroups and cluster more closely with central African Bantu-speaking groups. The non-Bantu speakers who lived in southeastern Kenya before Bantu speaking groups arrived were at least partially incorporated into what are now Bantu-speaking Taita groups. In contrast, gene flow from non-Bantu speakers into the Mijikenda was more limited. These results suggest a more complex demographic history where the nature of Bantu and non-Bantu interactions varied throughout the area.},

 abstract = {Abstract  The 1959 discovery of the hominin fossil Zinjanthropus boisei brought the world's attention to the rich records at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Subsequent excavations of archaeological level 22 (FLK Zinj) Bed I uncovered remains of Homo habilis and a high-density collection of fossils and Oldowan stone tools. The occurrence of this unusual collection of bones and tools at this specific location has been controversial for decades. We present paleoecological data that provide new insights into the origin of FLK Zinj. Our recent excavations 200 m north of the site uncovered a 0.5-m-thick tufa mound draped by Tuff IC, in the same stratigraphic horizon as level 22. Stable isotope analyses indicate that the carbonates were deposited by a freshwater spring. Phytolith analysis of the waxy clay under Tuff IC revealed abundant woody dicotyledon and palm phytoliths, indicating that the site was wooded to densely wooded. The time equivalency and close physical proximity of the two environments indicate the two are related. This study has provided the first documented evidence of springs in Bed I and these data have important implications for the interpretation of hominin behavior in meat acquisition and the ongoing debate on scavenging versus hunting. },

This analysis demonstrated that the assemblage was actually the product of a number of different processes, some natural and some human, operating one after the other. The first of these processes was the accumulation offaunal remains by humans, a process that included some damage to the bones and probably some effect on the relative frequencies of different elements. This wasfollowed by damage and probably partial destruction by carnivores, and then by small-scale displacement by stream action. This complex series of events obscured details of the human activities originally responsiblefor the accumulation, although some behavioral information could still be extracted.},

 abstract = {Twenty-two chimpanzee hair samples collected from night nests at two different "savanna" sites were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios represented as delta13C and delta15N values. The first at Ugalla, Tanzania is a miombo woodland with grass groundcover and small patches of forest. The second at Ishasha, Democratic Republic of the Congo is a habitat composed of riverine gallery forest, semideciduous thicket forest, wooded grassland, and grassland. Based on comparative data from other primates, Ugalla hair delta13C values suggest that the chimpanzees are feeding primarily in the woodland rather than in forest patches or on grassland foods (grasses or grammivorous fauna). Similar comparisons indicate that the Ishasha chimpanzees are feeding within the forests and not in more open areas. In addition, the Ugalla chimpanzees had delta15N values that indicate extensive ingestion of leguminous flowers, seeds, and/or leaves. The Ishasha samples show a range encompassing three trophic levels. Two samples with the most positive values may indicate a nursing signal or vertebrate-feeding. Three individuals with intermediate values are similar to those in omnivorous nonhuman primate species. The four individuals with the lowest values are very similar to those in herbivorous monkeys. Stable isotope ratios permit time-averaged and habitat-specific dietary comparisons among sites, even without habituation or detailed foraging observations.},

We hypothesised that feeding pigs these SDF would stimulate Cae and DC carbohydrate fermentation, resulting in a modification of the resident bacterial communities.MethodsFive groups of six pigs were each fed one diet based on wheat starch (WS) only, or treatment diets in which some WS was replaced by 10 % AX, or 10 % MLG, a combination of 5 % AX:5 % MLG (AXMLG), or completely replaced with ground whole wheat. Post-euthanasia, Cae and DC digesta were collected for analysis of fermentative end-products, and bacterial community profiles were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon 454 pyrosequencing.ResultsAcross all the SDF-containing diets, predominantly in the proximal region of the large intestine, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Mitsuokella and Streptococcus were most significantly influenced (P < 0.05), while notable changes were observed for the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families in the Cae and DC. The addition of MLG or AXMLG had the greatest effect of influencing bacterial profiles, reducing sequence proportions assigned to the genus Clostridium, considered detrimental to gut health, with associated increases in short-chain fatty acid and reduced ammonia concentrations.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated how the cereal SDF AX and MLG altered the large intestinal bacterial community composition, particularly proximally, further giving insights into how diets rich in specific complex carbohydrates shift the bacterial population, by increasing abundance and promoting greater diversity of those bacteria considered beneficial to gut health.},

 abstract = {Distributions and frequencies of carnivore tooth-marks on large mammal long-bone fragments are commonly used to infer the timing of hominin and carnivore access to prey resources in archaeofaunal assemblages. The strength of these inferences, however, is limited by a broad and currently inexplicable range of tooth-mark frequencies across experimental and archaeological assemblages. Controlling for this variation first requires that the sources be identified. Several sources of variation are examined here in an analysis of tooth-marked bone recovered from a modern spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) den assemblage in Amboseli Park, Kenya. Results indicate that tooth-mark frequencies: (1) depend on fragment size, (2) vary across mammals of different size classes, (3) are highly variable across equivalent portions of different long-bone elements, and (4) on certain long-bone portions are correlated with bone density and can be depressed in archaeological assemblages subjected to density-mediated attrition. Stronger inferences based on tooth-mark frequencies will require that such variation be taken into consideration, and methods for doing so are suggested.},

 abstract = {In the last few decades, zooarchaeological studies have demonstrated beyond doubt that the hunting abilities of hominins were quite formidable from quite early on. Unfortunately, direct evidence for the use of weapons in hunting is quite rare and depends heavily on the preservation of organic elements. In particular, in the absence of such evidence, it is notoriously difficult to pinpoint the first appearance of complex, mechanically-assisted projectiles (such as darts and arrows) in the archaeological record. In this chapter, we present data from a controlled ballistic experiment with the aim of establishing patterns in the formation of impact fractures that would allow for the discrimination of thrusting spears, (hand-thrown) javelins, and spearthrower darts and arrows. By controlling for the weapon tip shape, weight, and raw material, impact angle (IA), as well as target composition, we are able to focus on the key elements that separate the different launching systems: velocity and kinetic energy output. The results show that fracture scar length is proportional to kinetic energy at impact, but only if the impact is perpendicular, as acute IAs reduce the energy requirements for the production of large, typical impact fractures. We also confirm previous results of Hutchings (JAS 38:1737–1746, 2011) regarding the relationship between precursory loading rateImpact and fracture propagation speed, documenting a weak linear relationship between the two in our sample. We conclude by discussing the implications of this study for identifying different weapon armatures in the archaeological record.},

The mechanisms of evolutionary change are now better understood than they were in Darwin's time, thanks largely to great advances in genetics, both experimental and theoretical.

 abstract = { This paper presents an overview of unpublished or recent data obtained from taphonomic and zooarchaeological studies carried out on several Magdalenian osseous assemblages in the Gironde, most of which were performed or updated as part of the Magdatis project. These assemblages have been attributed to techno-complexes from the Lower Magdalenian (Saint-Germain-la-Rivière lower complex), Middle Magdalenian (Roc de Marcamps 2, Moulin-Neuf layer 2, Saint-Germain-la-Rivière upper complex and Fongaban) and Upper Magdalenian (Morin and row 24 of Faustin). They document, from a diachronic and synchronic standpoint, the relationships between Magdalenian hunter gatherers and their prey, principally ungulates. Our study focuses on the butchery of carcasses, from their transport to their disposal, through an investigation of the transportation methods, resources obtained, intensity of butchery, and techniques used, as well as any recurrences in the chaînes opératoires. We also discuss the variations in the modes of consumption in relation to the size of the prey, the seasons of procurement, and the function of the sites. Irrespective of the size of the hunted games, the carcasses are incomplete. The post-cranial axial skeletons have been abandoned at the kill site. The limb and mandible bones are common, but differences are observed between the species exploited, reflecting either logistical constraints or nutritional contingencies. The resources used are diverse at the residential sites (skin, meat, marrow, tendons and hoofs). The marrow has been particularly intensely exploited regardless of the season; this advanced use does not however extend to the extraction of the fat. The results of this study indicate that, despite palaeoenvironmental and cultural changes, there were no real differences during the whole Magdalenian period in Gironde and that human groups remained faithful to the same traditions regarding the acquisition and processing of carcasses.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the second and third stages of a multivariate taphonomic analysis of the bovid bone assemblage from Dunefield Midden (DFM), a Later Stone Age site on South Africa's west coast. The second stage investigates bovid skeletal element abundance and longbone fragmentation patterns at the site. The third stage integrates these data with bone modification data (Stewart 2010) to explore overall taphonomic variability between three different bovid size subgroups – small, small-medium and large. The results suggest that humans were the prime agents of assemblage formation, though carnivores are also implicated as contributors to density mediated attrition. The predominant taphonomic signatures of all bovid size classes are consistent with within-bone nutrient acquisition by the site's occupants. However, major differences are apparent between the subgroups in element representation, longbone portion abundance and fragmentation patterning. These differences are shown to reflect variation in processing/food-preparation behaviours related to carcass size. It is suggested that whereas intensive fragmentation of large bovid bones resulted from efforts to render bone grease, the small bovid bone assemblage was structured by marrow extraction. Further, small bovid elements with high marrow utility may have been preferentially targeted and treated in more standardised fashion. The small-medium bovids, most of which are domesticates (sheep), exhibit intermediate patterning between the other two, but this may be a sampling issue related to their relative scarcity at DFM.},

 abstract = {The debate between the proponents of the Recent African Origin and the Multiregional Evolution models for the origin of anatomically modern humans has not been of great importance to the interpretation of late Pleistocene human fossils in South Africa. The main reason is that both models propose that evidence of anatomically moderns should happen in South Africa at an early date. A more important issue to the African context is whether or not those early transitions to modernity were accompanied by the development of the distinctive local populations known today as the Khoisan. Serogenetic evidence suggests a relative antiquity for the origins of living Khoisan peoples, but this may simply reflect the longer time that anatomically modern peoples have lived in the sub-continent. A search for features of distinctive Khoisan morphology in the early remains may be of more value as it might indicate the presence of a local adaptive pattern to the special environment conditions of the region.},

There has been a definite shift for two decades within archaeology from an obsession with material remains to a healthier concern with past peoples and their behavior. Demographic methods in archaeology are not restricted to those undertaken in the course of archaeological surveys or excavations. The sources of demographic information in archaeology are varied, consisting of human skeletal remains, settlements, artifacts, food remains, the ecological potentials of human habitat, and historical and ethnohistoric records. A more sophisticated approach utilizes the life table, which represents the mortality history from birth to death of a cohort. Palaeodemographic data on human populations at various stages of cultural evolution have significant implications for understanding the changes in the mortality and fertility patterns of past human groups as related to changing life conditions and human biology.},

 abstract = {Carbohydrates comprise a large fraction of the typical diet, yet humans are only able to directly process some types of starch and simple sugars. The remainder transits the large intestine where it becomes food for the commensal bacterial community. This is an environment of not only intense competition but also impressive cooperation for available glycans, as these bacteria work to maximize their energy harvest from these carbohydrates during their limited transit time through the gut. The species within the gut microbiota use a variety of strategies to process and scavenge both dietary and host-produced glycans such as mucins. Some act as generalists that are able to degrade a wide range of polysaccharides, while others are specialists that are only able to target a few select glycans. All are members of a metabolic network where substantial cross-feeding takes place, as by-products of one organism serve as important resources for another. Much of this metabolic activity influences host physiology, as secondary metabolites and fermentation end products are absorbed either by the epithelial layer or by transit via the portal vein to the liver where they can have additional effects. These microbially derived compounds influence cell proliferation and apoptosis, modulate the immune response, and can alter host metabolism. This review summarizes the molecular underpinnings of these polysaccharide degradation processes, their impact on human health, and how we can manipulate them through the use of prebiotics.},

This marks the southernmost extent of the Pastoral Neolithic in eastern Africa. The paucity of sites attributable to early herding in this area may be due to a lack of survey in landscapes likely to have been preferred by livestock owners and to extensive contemporary cultivation in those same areas. Links can be drawn between the study area and previously documented sites with Narosura materials near Lake Eyasi, and between the study area and obsidian sources in the Lake Naivasha area of the Rift Valley, making the plateau and its surroundings a potentially promising area for further research.},

Cutmark orientation in particular has great potential to inform on various aspects of past behavior, and here we provide experimentally derived orientations with novice butchers in two contexts. The first models the butchery of a carcass part by a single individual, and the second the butchery of a carcass part by several individuals simultaneously. Our goal is to test the following hypothesis: do butchers working alone produce less variation in cutmark orientation than several working at once? Preliminary data indicate that, at least with the novices involved in this experiment, variation in cutmark angles does not differ significantly between the two scenarios. Although further experimental work is warranted, we suggest that while the number of individuals may play some role in determining cutmark orientations, experience and skill are also important factors.},

Traditionally, heuristics have been viewed as learned from the structure of elite debates. This article outlines a different view: that many political heuristics are evolved, biological adaptations that helped our ancestors deal with political problems in small‐scale social groups. By analyzing these evolved origins, it becomes possible to develop novel, testable predictions regarding the structure of political heuristics. This argument is illustrated through an extensive review of studies on the structure of the so‐called “deservingness” heuristic. The article concludes by outlining four principles that should guide future research on heuristics in political psychology.},

 abstract = {Studying the distribution of lithic raw materials around prehistoric sites, their procurement, transport, and use, are important for understanding organizational decisions of hunter‐gatherers. Here we examine lithic technological organization in two stratigraphic subunits B4 and B1 (dated ∼ 68 and ∼ 55 ka, respectively) at the Neanderthal site of Amud Cave. The lithic assemblages are made exclusively of flint. An ArcGIS model is used to create a predictive model for daily exploitation territories (DETs) around the site. Using a battery of statistical methods (ANOVA, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis), we link flint visual types with geochemical characteristics (obtained through inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry and ICP atomic emission spectrometry) of both geological and archaeological flints. Results indicate that local materials are abundant in both subunits. Nonlocal raw materials (from areas beyond the modeled DET) amount to 30–40% across all technological categories, suggesting long‐distance transport. The technological patterns of the nonlocal raw material differ between the two subunits. Pending results of additional work, we suggest that nonlocal flint types were likely obtained from distances >60 km. Mobility patterns inferred from this study suggest that Amud Cave was a focal location within its settlement system during both occupation periods, but the manner of site use and mobility patterns changed through time.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the relaionship between “population pressure” and socioeconomic complexity among hunter-gatherers. Population pressure is defined as the ratio between population density and the density of available resources. Socioeconomic complexity is measured by means of several correlated variables: storage-dependence, sedentism, social inequality, and use of a medium of exchange. Correlations between these variables are calculated from an ethnographic sample of 94 hunter-gatherer groups. The correlations between population pressure and socioeconomic complexity are found to be extremely high. Two major types of hunter-gatherers exist which are distinguished by a number of variables and may be termed “simple” and “complex.” Transitional groups between these two types are quite rare. It is also noted that population pressure does not arise in continental climates where famine mortality is common because of high-amplitude changes in productivity from year to year. It is argued that population pressure is a necessary and sufficient condition for and the efficient cause of socioeconomic complexity. The widespread disavowal by archaeologists of population pressure as a possible explanation for the prehistoric development of complex hunter-gatherers has no basis in ethnographic fact.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Microscopic analysis represents a powerful tool for understanding taphonomy. Our work, as in other studies, aims to identify the origin of different kinds of marks on bones. In this paper, we test the application of a HIROX Digital Microscope KH‐7700. This microscope captures 3D images of the bone surface, thus bringing into focus the whole section of striations. This enables the direct observation of their shape from several points of view and the relatively rapid procurement of a variety of measurements (e.g. depth, breadth, angles). This technology has been applied to several butchery experiments, in which both stone and metal tools have been used to produce cut marks on skeletal elements. The morphometrical parameters presented in this paper enabled the correct identification of the different origins of experimental striations and were further tested on two archaeological sets of cut marks inflicted by both metal blades and flint flakes or tools. Therefore, the obtained experimental records constitute a useful database for archaeological remains. The morphometrical parameters developed and implemented in this study represent objective criteria for identifying the origin of cut marks which can be processed through statistical analysis.

 abstract = {Large carnivores structure the character of scavenging opportunities in any environment. In Pliocene and early Pleistocene Africa there were three large sabertooth cats sympatric with the ancestors of the modern felid community, and scavenging opportunities were presumably different from those in modern Africa. An understanding of a possible scavenging niche for early hominids must articulate knowledge gained from actualistic research with detailed reconstructions of extinct carnivore paleoecology.Contrasting skeletal and dental anatomy suggest that sabertooths and modern felids were ecologically distinct. Evidence from functional morphology and fossil associations elucidates the distinctions. Sabertooth incisor and carnassial morphology indicates extreme flesh specialisation and lack of bone-crushing ability. Sabertooth cranial morphology and fossil associations suggest a specialisation upon very large prey. The post-cranial morphology of sabertooths indicates a dense woodland and forest habitat preference. This implies that two distinct large carnivore communities existed in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene: a mixed and open habitat community composed of the ancestors of the extant carnivore community plus Chasmaporthetes, and a closed habitat community dominated by the sabertooths. Scavenging opportunities in the closed habitat community would have been much better than in more open habitats. Homo habilis with its inferred arboreal abilities could have passively scavenged very effectively in dense woodlands and forests.Paleoenvironmental and paleontological data indicate that these closed habitats shrunk after 1·7 million years ago and the sabertooths probably went extinct in sub-Saharan Africa. Homo habilis perhaps increasingly utilised more open habitats and would have been forced to confront large predators to gain adequate scavenging returns. Archaeological data of stone tool raw materials and site placement suggests that early hominids switched from an emphasis on dense woodland habitats to increased usage of more open habitats after 1·6 million years ago. Confrontational scavenging along with increased predation pressure may have contributed to the morphological changes associated with the shift to Homo erectus.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of studying the genetic kinship of those human groups characterized by a deeply rooted ethnicity has traditionally been and still is an interesting goal of anthropological and population genetic studies. However, only a few surveys have aimed to learn about the impact of industrial development on the consanguinity of these populations and even those have concentrated on industrialized regions. This approach is worth analysing in Spain, where industrialization was late in relation to other western European countries.
AIM: In this work we analyse the characteristics of inbreeding in Guipúzcoa from 1951 to 1995. This Basque province underwent industrial and tourist development earlier than other Spanish regions. It has the highest density of Basque speakers and has always occupied a central position within the map of distribution of the Basque language. Guipúzcoa is geographically placed in the core of the Basque area. SUDJECTS AND METHODS: Data on consanguineous marriages recorded in the province of Guipúzcoa between 1951 and 1995 were taken from Roman Catholic dispensations stored in the Diocesan Archives of San Sebastián, the province's capital city. Over the whole time period, a total of 1152 consanguineous marriages were registered.
RESULTS: The high frequencies of first cousin (M22) (F = 1/16) and uncle-niece, aunt-nephew (M12) (F = 1/8) consanguineous marriages distinguish Guipúzcoa from the rest of Iberian populations. The M22/M33 ratio (with M33 being second cousins) has never dropped below 0.67, which represents a significant deviation from the expectation value of 0.25. When consanguineous marriages are classified according to marriage partner birthplaces interesting results emerge. Provincial endogamy shows the highest consanguinity rates (57%) and the proportion of M22/M33 is also rather high (0.63). However, a major contribution to the consanguinity levels and mean inbreeding coefficient recorded in Guipúzcoa over recent decades has been made by immigrant relative groups coming from other geographical areas of Spain. In this segment of population the observed M22/M33 rates are 1.44.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows again how important preferentiality (or avoidance) is in human consanguinity, and also how human groups, in spite of being spatially settled in the same territory, present differential attitudes for given consanguinity patterns.},

 abstract = {Costly signaling has been proposed as a possible mechanism to explain food sharing in foraging populations. This sharing-as-signaling hypothesis predicts an association between sharing and status. Using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), this prediction is tested on a social network of between-household food-sharing relationships in the fishing and sea-hunting village of Lamalera, Indonesia. Previous analyses (Nolin 2010) have shown that most sharing in Lamalera is consistent with reciprocal altruism. The question addressed here is whether any additional variation may be explained as sharing-as-signaling by high-status households. The results show that high-status households both give and receive more than other households, a pattern more consistent with reciprocal altruism than costly signaling. However, once the propensity to reciprocate and household productivity are controlled, households of men holding leadership positions show greater odds of unreciprocated giving when compared to households of non-leaders. This pattern of excessive giving by leaders is consistent with the sharing-as-signaling hypothesis. Wealthy households show the opposite pattern, giving less and receiving more than other households. These households may reciprocate in a currency other than food or their wealth may attract favor-seeking behavior from others. Overall, status covariates explain little variation in the sharing network as a whole, and much of the sharing observed by high-status households is best explained by the same factors that explain sharing by other households. This pattern suggests that multiple mechanisms may operate simultaneously to promote sharing in Lamalera and that signaling may motivate some sharing by some individuals even within sharing regimes primarily maintained by other mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic (MP) faunal assemblages have gained widespread attention due to their relevance to the debate over the modernity of hominid behavior during the MSA/MP. A recent critique of the scavenging argument for MSA/MP behavior drew on a summary presentation of the skeletal abundance and surface modification data from Die Kelders Cave 1 Layer 10 (Marean, 1998). This paper provides a more complete presentation of those data, adds the smaller Layer 11 sample, and provides a detailed analysis of the taphonomic history of both samples.Bone fragment density is higher in Layer 10 than in Layer 11. Bone densities vary horizontally as well, with Layer 10 showing greater deposition in the exposed areas of the cave. An analysis of long bone breakage patterns indicates that non-nutritive breakage on the Layers 10 and 11 samples was present but not intense. Size 1 mammals were predominantly accumulated by owls and/or other large raptors, not hominids, in Layer 10. Hominids were the predominant accumulator of Sizes 2-4 mammals in Layers 10 and 11 as indicated by the frequency of hammer-stone percussion marks and carnivore toothmarks. After discard by hominids, a significant portion of these remains were discovered and scavenged by carnivores. Overall, the larger mammal fauna of Layer 10 is dominated by Sizes 3 and 4 bovids, mostly young and adult eland, and thus hominids were focusing on the high-ranked prey items. Shaft portions of long bones, the portions with the most flesh, have the highest frequencies of cutmarks. A comparison of the Layers 10 and 11 cutmark frequencies to Selvaggio's (1998) scavenging model shows that the frequencies are significantly outside the range of variation documented in Selavaggio's scavenging sample.},

 abstract = {Mate choice by males has been recognized at least since Darwin's time, but its phylogenetic distribution and effect on the evolution of female phenotypes remain poorly known. Moreover, the relative importance of factors thought to underlie the evolution of male mate choice (especially parental investment and mate quality variance) is still unresolved. Here I synthesize the empirical evidence and theory pertaining to the evolution of male mate choice and sex role reversal in insects, and examine the potential for male mating preferences to generate sexual selection on female phenotypes. Although male mate choice has received relatively little empirical study, the available evidence suggests that it is widespread among insects (and other animals). In addition to 'precopulatory' male mate choice, some insects exhibit 'cryptic' male mate choice, varying the amount of resources allocated to mating on the basis of female mate quality. As predicted by theory, the most commonly observed male mating preferences are those that tend to maximize a male's expected fertilization success from each mating. Such preferences tend to favour female phenotypes associated with high fecundity or reduced sperm competition intensity. Among insect species there is wide variation in mechanisms used by males to assess female mate quality, some of which (e.g. probing, antennating or repeatedly mounting the female) may be difficult to distinguish from copulatory courtship. According to theory, selection for male choosiness is an increasing function of mate quality variance and those reproductive costs that reduce, with each mating, the number of subsequent matings that a male can perform ('mating investment') Conversely, choosiness is constrained by the costs of mate search and assessment, in combination with the accuracy of assessment of potential mates and of the distribution of mate qualities. Stronger selection for male choosiness may also be expected in systems where female fitness increases with each copulation than in systems where female fitness peaks at a small number of matings. This theoretical framework is consistent with most of the empirical evidence. Furthermore, a variety of observed male mating preferences have the potential to exert sexual selection on female phenotypes. However, because male insects typically choose females based on phenotypic indicators of fecundity such as body size, and these are usually amenable to direct visual or tactile assessment, male mate choice often tends to reinforce stronger vectors of fecundity or viability selection, and seldom results in the evolution of female display traits. Research on orthopterans has shown that complete sex role reversal (i.e. males choosy, females competitive) can occur when male parental investment limits female fecundity and reduces the potential rate of reproduction of males sufficiently to produce a female-biased operational sex ratio. By contrast, many systems exhibiting partial sex role reversal (i.e. males choosy and competitive) are not associated with elevated levels of male parental investment, reduced male reproductive rates, or reduced male bias in the operational sex ratio. Instead, large female mate quality variance resulting from factors such as strong last-male sperm precedence or large variance in female fecundity may select for both male choosiness and competitiveness in such systems. Thus, partial and complete sex role reversal do not merely represent different points along a continuum of increasing male parental investment, but may evolve via different evolutionary pathways.},

 abstract = {Previous research in North America has supported the view that male involvement in committed, romantic relationships is associated with lower testosterone (T) levels. Here, we test the prediction that undergraduate men involved in committed, romantic relationships (paired) will have lower T levels than men not involved in such relationships (unpaired). Further, we also test whether these differences are more apparent in samples collected later, rather than earlier, in the day. For this study, 107 undergraduate men filled out a questionnaire and collected one saliva sample (from which a subject’s T level was measured) at various times across the day. As in previous studies, men involved in committed, romantic relationships had lower salivary T levels, though only during later times of the day. Furthermore, additional analysis of the variation among unpaired subjects indicated that men without prior relationship experience had lower T levels than experienced men. Finally, while paired men as a group had lower T levels than unpaired men, those men at the earliest stage (less than six months) of a current relationship had higher T levels than unpaired men as well as men in longer-term relationships. These results suggest that variation in male testosterone levels may reflect differential behavioral allocation to mating effort.},

 abstract = {Members of social groups face a trade-off between investing selfish effort for themselves and investing cooperative effort to produce a shared group resource. Many group resources are shared equitably: they may be intrinsically non-excludable public goods, such as vigilance against predators, or so large that there is little cost to sharing, such as cooperatively hunted big game. However, group members' personal resources, such as food hunted individually, may be monopolizable. In such cases, an individual may benefit by investing effort in taking others' personal resources, and in defending one's own resources against others. We use a game theoretic "tug-of-war" model to predict that when such competition over personal resources is possible, players will contribute more towards a group resource, and also obtain higher payoffs from doing so. We test and find support for these predictions in two laboratory economic games with humans, comparing people's investment decisions in games with and without the options to compete over personal resources or invest in a group resource. Our results help explain why people cooperatively contribute to group resources, suggest how a tragedy of the commons may be avoided, and highlight unifying features in the evolution of cooperation and competition in human and non-human societies.},

Questionnaires, depicting a variety of contexts in which one person was asked to share a resource with another, were used to examine participants' expectations of food-sharing behavior. Factors that were varied included the value of the resource, the relation between the two depicted actors, the quality of this relation, and gender. Results indicate that internal models of food-sharing behavior showed systematic patterns of variation, demonstrating that individuals have complex contextually based internal models at all ages, including the youngest. Examination of developmental changes in use of individual patterns is consistent with the idea that internal models reflect age-specific patterns of interactions while undergoing a process of progressive consolidation.},

 abstract = {In discussions of Paleolithic hominin behavior it is often assumed that cut marks are an unwanted byproduct of butchery activities, and that their production causes the dulling of stone tool edges. It is also presumed that Paleolithic butchers would have refrained from making cut marks to extend the use life of their tools. We conducted a series of butchery experiments designed to test the hypothesis that cut marks affect the use life of tools. Results suggest cut marks are not associated with edge attrition of simple flake tools, and therefore it is unlikely that Paleolithic butchers would have avoided contact between bone surfaces and tool edges. Edge attrition is, however, significantly greater during skinning and disarticulation than during defleshing. This suggests that skinning and disarticulation activities would require more tool edges relative to butchery events focused purely on defleshing. Differences between the number of cut-marked bones relative to the number of stone artifacts deposited at taphonomically comparable archaeological localities may be explicable in terms of different types of butchery activities conducted there, rather than strictly the timing of carcass access by hominins. Archaeological localities with higher artifact discard rates relative to raw material availability may represent an emphasis on activities associated with higher edge attrition (e.g. skinning or disarticulation).},

 abstract = {The Mbuti pygmies, hunter-gatherers of the Ituri Forest of Zaire, trade forest products and labor for agricultural foods. It has been assumed that the Mbuti lived independently in the equatorial forest prior to its penetration by shifting cultivators. We assessed forest food resources (plant and animal) to determine their adequacy to support a hunting and gathering economy. For five months of the year, essentially none of the calorically important forest fruits and seeds are available. Honey is not abundant during this season of scarcity. Wild game meat is available year round, but the main animals caught have low fat content. This makes them a poor substitute for starch-dense agricultural foods, now staples in Mbuti diet. In general, in the closed evergreen forest zone, edible wild plant species are more abundant in agriculturally derived secondary forest than in primary forest. Similarly, they are more common at the savanna ecotone and in gallery forests. We suggest that it is unlikely that hunter-gatherers would have lived independently in the forest interior with its precarious resource base, when many of the food species they exploit are more abundant toward the savanna border.},

 abstract = {Differences between body part representation of small and large domestic stock at Ngamuriak, a Pastoral Neolithic site in Kenya, are generally similar to those described for small and large wild animals at many other sites from different time periods. In order to explore the underlying reasons for the existence of these patterns at Ngamuriak, multiple regression was used to consider the value of meat, marrow, bone grease, and bone density for predicting body part representation. Caprine body part patterns could be predicted quite accurately by marrow and bone grease. Cattle body part patterns could not be predicted very well, and patterns were not so consistent. Within-bone nutrients and density were the most useful variables for predicting body part representation. These results, along with patterns of long bone breakage, suggest that the difference between caprines and cattle resulted from differences in bone processing. Since processing for within-bone nutrients at Ngamuriak created patterns of skeletal part representation that are similar to those attributed at other sites to meat transport, our results suggest that the role of within-bone nutrients should be examined before transport based on meat value is assumed.},

Population and evolutionary genetic research has demonstrated a species-wide phylogeographic structure that faithfully mirrors that of its human host. However, because of its very high genetic diversity and fast generation time, H. pylori DNA sequences are often better able to resolve prehistoric human migrations than human DNA markers. The worldwide genetic diversity of H. pylori has, thus far, been divided into 7 populations and 14 subpopulations, most of which are now established markers for recent and prehistoric human migrations. Key developments such as the inference of hypothetical ancestral populations and the implementation of coalescent models have provided a clearer understanding of the population historical role of admixture and recombination and helped superimpose a chronology onto the human H. pylori association, from which the timing, direction, and magnitude of migration events can be accurately inferred. However, there remain large parts of the world from which H. pylori has never been cultured, and this, along with a move to sequence whole genomes rather than just housekeeping genes, will form the basis of future evolutionary genetic research.},

 abstract = {Social learning, as an information acquisition process, enables intergenerational transmission and the stabilisation of cultural forms, generating and sustaining behavioural traditions within human groups. Archaeologically, such social processes might become observable by identifying repetitions in the record that result from the execution of standardised actions. From a zooarchaeological perspective, the processing and consumption of carcasses may be used to identify these types of phenomena at the sites. To investigate this idea, several faunal assemblages from Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain, MIS 9-5e) and Gran Dolina TD10-1 (Burgos, Spain, MIS 9) were analysed. The data show that some butchery activities exhibit variability as a result of multiple conditioning factors and, therefore, the identification of cultural patterns through the resulting cut-marks presents additional difficulties. However, other activities, such as marrow removal by means of intentional breakage, seem to reflect standardised actions unrelated to the physical characteristics of the bones. The statistical tests we applied show no correlation between the less dense areas of the bones and the location of impacts. Comparison of our experimental series with the archaeological samples indicates a counter-intuitive selection of the preferred locus of impact, especially marked in the case of Bolomor IV. This fact supports the view that bone breakage was executed counter-intuitively and repetitively on specific sections because it may have been part of an acquired behavioural repertoire. These reiterations differ between levels and sites, suggesting the possible existence of cultural identities or behavioural predispositions dependant on groups. On this basis, the study of patterns could significantly contribute to the identification of occupational strategies and organisation of the hominids in a territory. In this study, we use faunal data in identifying the mechanics of intergenerational information transmission within Middle Pleistocene human communities and provide new ideas for the investigation of occupational dynamics from a zooarchaeological approach.},

 abstract = {This report is the result of discussions and recommendations of the Archaeology Committee of the African Studies Association, which met in Chicago early in April, 1966. African archaeology is at present an international discipline producing close collaboration among scientists from different countries, and the future of archaeological research in the continent can best be viewed as an international exercise in which American palaeo-anthropologists are beginning to play an increasingly important part. These brief notes attempt to synthesize the present position in African prehistoric studies, to show the general direction in which these are being developed, and to indicate immediate priorities in basic research and training.
                  The 1965 Wenner-Gren Conference on African archaeology and evolutionary studies showed that palaeo-anthropology and the closely associated studies of stratigraphers and palaeontologists are now entering upon a new stage of precision in analysis, dating, and interpretation. It emphasized the absolute necessity for new basic research to be undertaken, organized as a series of team projects.
                  New discoveries have resulted in revised concepts of the origin and evolution of animal species, vegetation patterns, landscape features, and of man himself and his culture. This more precise knowledge has underlined the need above all to review the revised dating of human and cultural evolution in the light of the geophysical methods that now provide an absolute time scale. This is equally as applicable to archaeologists and ethnohistorians concerned with later prehistoric times as it is to those dealing with the study of early man.},

 abstract = {Archaeologists can use different kinds of data to identify recycling. However, most approaches to recycling are based on lithic artefact attributes, especially on surface alterations, suggesting a period of discard between different events. Recycling can also be approached by means of faunal remains based on bone damage characteristics. Bone breakage processes, aimed at maximizing the nutritional value of consumed animals, generate a high number of small- and large-sized fragments, which are eventually discarded. Some of these are morphologically suitable for human use. It is necessary to distinguish between the use of bone as raw material from pre-existing very large-sized carcasses such as elephants (in cases where it is not certain if these had a nutritional purpose) and the recycling of fragments resulting from bone marrow extraction of smaller mammals that were obtained and consumed by human groups. In the first case, when the bones of a pre-existing elephant (including natural deaths) are exploited for tool making, the bones can be considered raw material, very similar to collecting stones as raw material for the lithic industry. In the second case, the bones of smaller mammals are selected to be used in a subsequent life cycle, after being broken for nutritional purposes and discarded. Here, we present some early cases of recycled bones from the Middle Pleistocene sites of Gran Dolina TD10-1 and Bolomor Cave in Spain and Qesem Cave in Israel. The studied elements appear to have been part of a previous faunal processing sequence (nutritional in nature), which were later discarded, and then used or modified for purposes other than the original ones. These fragments are dated to MIS 9 and show damage produced by use (retouched and unmodified soft retouchers) or shaped forms (bone artefacts). This study is an attempt to provide new data on recycling activities of faunal remains in the Middle Pleistocene and discuss the origin of this behaviour.},

 abstract = {There is general agreement that the diet of early hominins underwent dramatic changes shortly after the appearance of stone tools in the archaeological record. It is often assumed that this change is associated with dietary expansion to incorporate large mammal resources. Although other aspects of the hominin diet, such as aquatic or vegetal resources, are assumed to be a part of hominin subsistence, identifying evidence of these adaptations has proved difficult. Here we present a series of analyses that provide methodological support for the inclusion of aquatic resources in hominin dietary reconstructions. We suggest that bone surface modifications in aquatic species are morphologically distinguishable from bone surface modifications on terrestrial taxa. We relate these findings to differences that we document in the surface mechanical properties of the two types of bone, as reflected by significant differences in bone surface microhardness values between aquatic and terrestrial species. We hypothesize that the characteristics of bone surface modifications on aquatic taxa inhibit the ability of zooarchaeologists to consistently diagnose them correctly. Contingently, this difficulty influences correspondence levels between zooarchaeologists, and may therefore result in misinterpretation of the taphonomic history of early Pleistocene aquatic faunal assemblages. A blind test using aquatic specimens and a select group of 9 experienced zooarchaeologists as participants was designed to test this hypothesis. Investigation of 4 different possible explanations for blind test results suggest the dominant factors explaining patterning relate to (1) the specific methodologies employed to diagnose modifications on aquatic specimens and (2) the relative experience of participants with modifications on aquatic bone surfaces. Consequently we argue that an important component of early hominin diets may have hitherto been overlooked as a result of (a) the paucity of referential frameworks within which to identify such a component and (b) the inability of applied identification methodologies to consistently do so.},

 abstract = {Hypotheses of feeding behaviors and community structure are testable with rare direct evidence of trophic interactions in the fossil record (e.g., bite marks). We present evidence of four predation, scavenging, and/or interspecific fighting events involving two large paracrocodylomorphs (=‘rauisuchians’) from the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation (∼220–210 Ma). The larger femur preserves a rare history of interactions with multiple actors prior to and after death of this ∼8–9-m individual. A large embedded tooth crown and punctures, all of which display reaction tissue formed through healing, record evidence of a failed attack on this individual. The second paracrocodylomorph femur exhibits four unhealed bite marks, indicating the animal either did not survive the attack or was scavenged soon after death. The combination of character states observed (e.g., morphology of the embedded tooth, ‘D’-shaped punctures, evidence of bicarination of the marking teeth, spacing of potentially serial marks) indicates that large phytosaurs were actors in both cases. Our analysis of these specimens demonstrates phytosaurs targeted large paracrocodylomorphs in these Late Triassic ecosystems. Previous distinctions between ‘aquatic’ and ‘terrestrial’ Late Triassic trophic structures were overly simplistic and built upon mistaken paleoecological assumptions; we show they were intimately connected at the highest trophic levels. Our data also support that size cannot be the sole factor in determining trophic status. Furthermore, these marks provide an opportunity to start exploring the seemingly unbalanced terrestrial ecosystems from the Late Triassic of North America, in which large carnivores far outnumber herbivores in terms of both abundance and diversity.},

 abstract = {Genetic differentiation among human populations is greatly influenced by geography due to the accumulation of local allele frequency differences. However, little is known about the possibly different increment of genetic differentiation along the different geographical axes (north-south, east-west, etc.). Here, we provide new methods to examine the asymmetrical patterns of genetic differentiation. We analyzed genome-wide polymorphism data from populations in Africa (n = 29), Asia (n = 26), America (n = 9), and Europe (n = 38), and we found that the major orientations of genetic differentiation are north-south in Europe and Africa, and east-west in Asia, but no preferential orientation was found in the Americas. Additionally, we showed that the localization of the individual geographic origins based on single nucleotide polymorphism data was not equally precise along all orientations. Confirming our findings, we obtained that, in each continent, the orientation along which the precision is maximal corresponds to the orientation of maximum differentiation. Our results have implications for interpreting human genetic variation in terms of isolation by distance and spatial range expansion processes. In Europe, for instance, the precise northnorthwest-southsoutheast axis of main European differentiation cannot be explained by a simple Neolithic demic diffusion model without admixture with the local populations because in that case the orientation of greatest differentiation should be perpendicular to the direction of expansion. In addition to humans, anisotropic analyses can guide the description of genetic differentiation for other organisms and provide information on expansions of invasive species or the processes of plant dispersal.},

 abstract = {BackgroundDietary changes associated to shifts in subsistence strategies during human evolution may have induced new selective pressures on phenotypes, as currently held for lactase persistence. Similar hypotheses exist for arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) mediated acetylation capacity, a well-known pharmacogenetic trait with wide inter-individual variation explained by polymorphisms in the NAT2 gene. The environmental causative factor (if any) driving its evolution is as yet unknown, but significant differences in prevalence of acetylation phenotypes are found between hunter-gatherer and food-producing populations, both in sub-Saharan Africa and worldwide, and between agriculturalists and pastoralists in Central Asia. These two subsistence strategies also prevail among sympatric populations of the African Sahel, but knowledge on NAT2 variation among African pastoral nomads was up to now very scarce. Here we addressed the hypothesis of different selective pressures associated to the agriculturalist or pastoralist lifestyles having acted on the evolution of NAT2 by sequencing the gene in 287 individuals from five pastoralist and one agriculturalist Sahelian populations.ResultsWe show that the significant NAT2 genetic structure of African populations is mainly due to frequency differences of three major haplotypes, two of which are categorized as decreased function alleles (NAT2*5B and NAT2*6A), particularly common in populations living in arid environments, and one fast allele (NAT2*12A), more frequently detected in populations living in tropical humid environments. This genetic structure does associate more strongly with a classification of populations according to ecoregions than to subsistence strategies, mainly because most Sahelian and East African populations display little to no genetic differentiation between them, although both regions hold nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralist and sedentary agriculturalist communities. Furthermore, we found significantly higher predicted proportions of slow acetylators in pastoralists than in agriculturalists, but also among food-producing populations living in the Sahelian and dry savanna zones than in those living in humid environments, irrespective of their mode of subsistence.ConclusionOur results suggest a possible independent influence of both the dietary habits associated with subsistence modes and the chemical environment associated with climatic zones and biomes on the evolution of NAT2 diversity in sub-Saharan African populations.},

 abstract = {Description and analysis of the skeletal elements of two ungulates of different size, Bos and Dama at the open-air, lower Palaeolithic site of Holon (Israel). Several skeletal indices clearly show inter-species differences probably reflecting variation in the mode of exploitation of the carcass according to body size of the animal. Both species have a reverse utility curve (MGUI index) which is characteristic of butchery sites. Bone density is not correlated with skeletal element representation, evidence that the anatomical profile has not been significantly biased by bone preservation. Combined with data taken from modern references and archaeological ones from Palaeolithic sites from Europe and the Levant, multi-variate analysis of skeletal representation at Holon illustrates that the assemblages are distributed into four groups, each dominated by a different element such as cranial, trunk or upper limbs. Holon presents assemblages dominated by crania and extremities, indicating that axial and upper limbs elements rich in meat were removed from the site. The high MNI counts per species and species diversity at the site as well as the presence of cut marks and carnivore damage on some 6 % of the bones favour a model of a series of kill/butchery occurrences when animals were killed and/or scavenged by hominids and carnivores.
Description et analyse de la représentation squelettique de deux ongulés — Bos et Dama — présentant des tailles différentes provenant d'un site de plein air du paléolithique inférieur, Holon (Israël). Les résultats obtenus montrent que les différences interspécifiques notées dans les indices squelettiques relèvent clairement d'une exploitation différentielle des carcasses liée à la taille de l'animal. Les deux espèces présentent une courbe d'utilité inverse (IUGM) caractéristique des sites de boucherie. La non-corrélation entre la densité osseuse et la distribution des éléments anatomiques montre que les profils correspondants sont biaises de façon significative par la conservation différentielle. Une analyse factorielle fondée sur les portions anatomiques, utilisant divers analogues modernes ainsi que des carcasses provenant de sites du Paléolithique européen et du Levant, montre des groupements en fonction des parties riches ou pauvres en viande. Ainsi Holon se caractérise par une abondance en éléments crâniens et par un déficit en éléments du squelette axial et des membres. Ces résultats associés à la diversité taxonomique qu 'offre le site, à la présence de stries de découpe et à un faible pourcentage de traces de carnivores peuvent être interprétés comme le témoignage d'une suite d'abattages et/ou de dépeçages d'animaux apportés et/ou charognes aussi bien par des hominidés que par des carnivores.},

 abstract = {In the study reported here we examined the impact of population size and two proxies of risk of resource failure on the diversity and complexity of the food-getting toolkits of hunter–gatherers and small-scale food producers. We tested three hypotheses: the risk hypothesis, the population-size hypothesis, and a hypothesis derived from niche construction theory. Our analyses indicated that the toolkits of hunter–gatherers are more affected by risk than are the toolkits of food producers. They also showed that the toolkits of food producers are more affected by population size than are the toolkits of hunter–gatherers. This pattern is inconsistent with the predictions of both the risk hypothesis and the population-size hypothesis. In contrast, it is consistent with the predictions of the niche construction hypothesis. Our results indicate that niche construction has affected the evolution of technology in small-scale societies and imply that niche construction must be taken into account when seeking to understand technological variation among food producers and the technological changes that occurred in association with the various transitions to farming that have occurred over the last 10,000 years.},

 abstract = {With an age of ∼1.4 Ma, the Early Pleistocene archaeopaleontological sites of Barranco León and Fuente Nueva-3 (Orce, Baza Basin, SE Spain) provide the oldest evidence on human presence in Western Europe, including the finding of a deciduous tooth of Homo sp., huge lithic assemblages of Oldowan tradition and abundant cut-marks on large mammal bones. Here we use a mathematical approach based on Leslie matrices to quantify for the large mammal species preserved at the sites the biomass of primary consumers available, the distribution of meat resources among the secondary consumers and the competition intensity within the carnivore guild. The results obtained show a community of large mammals with a high diversity of secondary consumers that would satisfy slightly less than half of their dietary requirements under optimal ecological conditions. In the case of Homo sp., and considering that flesh resources were obtained through the scavenging of ungulate carcasses, the model indicates that the ecosystems of the basin could hold 10–14 individuals per 100 km2 during a year, a value that is close to the mean population density of recent hunter-gatherers. These density estimates decrease slightly when a mixed hunting-scavenging strategy is considered and even more in the case of a strict hunting behavior. In addition, the value of the species competition index obtained for Homo sp. is among the lowest of the carnivore guild. These results suggest that the hominin populations that inhabited Southeast Spain during the Early Pleistocene behaved more as opportunistic scavengers than as active predators.},

In this fertile atmosphere, the seeds of genome sequencing were sown. The progressive spirit pervading research in the life sciences at this time helped to fuel the conception of the Human Genome Project (HGP), whose primary aims were to determine the identity of the three billion nucleotides comprising the human genome and characterize the full repertoire of genes encoded therein. Delineation of the human genome sequence has consequently enhanced our understanding of human genetics, and ignited the development of such diverse disciplines as comparative genomics, pharmacogenetics, and nutrigenomics. The fruits of the HGP directly contributed to the creation of the HapMap and 1,000 Genomes projects, which has since provided the basis for whole genome association (WGA) studies, thereby facilitating elucidation of the genetic variants that underlie the development of complex diseases including cancer, diabetes, autoimmune syndromes, and neurological disorders. Thus, the HGP continues to exert a significant influence upon our comprehension of human genetics, our understanding of complex disease susceptibility, and ultimately, the manner in which scientific research is currently conducted.},

 abstract = {Relative abundances of skeletal elements at Plio-Pleistocene archaeological sites have long been interpreted to represent selective transport of portions of large prey. Models from optimal foraging theory suggest that the degree of carcass transport selectivity reflects transport constraints, particularly transport distance. A quantitative analysis of skeletal element abundances in five bone assemblages from Bed I, Olduvai Gorge, indicates that within the subset of elements most likely to resist attritional processes, there is no evidence for preferential transport of small or large mammals. The results suggest relatively low carcass transport costs and are most consistent with site formation models favoring short-distance carcass transport. The data are also consistent with the possibility that hominins were not responsible for transporting bones at some sites. Several Bed I assemblages, with the exception of FLK-Zinjanthropus, lack evidence of a functional relationship between flaked stone artifacts and the faunal remains, such as cut-marks or percussion-marks on bone. In conjunction with the skeletal part data, this suggests that hominin involvement with the bone assemblages was minimal at all sites but FLK-Zinjanthropus. The patterning at Bed I contrasts strongly with Middle Stone Age and Middle Paleolithic assemblages, which provide clear evidence for selective transport, suggesting higher transport costs and longer transport distances.},

 abstract = {The aim of this study is to explain the occurrence of food sharing across primates. Defined as the unresisted transfer of food, evolutionary hypotheses have to explain why possessors should relinquish food rather than keep it. While sharing with offspring can be explained by kin selection, explanations for sharing among unrelated adults are more controversial. Here we test the hypothesis that sharing occurs with social partners that have leverage over food possessors due to the opportunity for partner choice in other contexts. Thus, we predict that possessors should relinquish food to potential mates or allies, who could provide or withhold matings or coalitionary support in the future. We used phylogenetic analyses based on both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches in a sample of 68 primate species to test these predictions. The analyses strongly indicate that (1) sharing with offspring is predicted by the relative processing difficulty of the diet, as measured by the degree of extractive foraging, but not overall diet quality, (2) food sharing among adults only evolved in species already sharing with offspring, regardless of diet, and (3) male–female sharing co-evolved with the opportunity for female mate choice and sharing within the sexes with coalition formation. These results provide comparative support for the hypothesis that sharing is “traded” for matings and coalitionary support in the sense that these services are statistically associated and can thus be selected for. Based on this, we predict that sharing should occur in any species with opportunities for partner choice.},

 abstract = {In any given species, cooperation involves prosocial acts that usually return a fitness benefit to the actor. These acts are produced by a set of psychological rules, which will be similar in related species if they have a similar natural history of cooperation. Prosocial acts can be (i) reactive, i.e. in response to specific stimuli, or (ii) proactive, i.e. occur in the absence of such stimuli. We propose that reactive prosocial acts reflect sensitivity to (i) signals or signs of need and (ii) the presence and size of an audience, as modified by (iii) social distance to the partner or partners. We examine the evidence for these elements in humans and other animals, especially non-human primates, based on the natural history of cooperation, quantified in the context of food sharing, and various experimental paradigms. The comparison suggests that humans share with their closest living relatives reactive responses to signals of need, but differ in sensitivity to signs of need and cues of being watched, as well as in the presence of proactive prosociality. We discuss ultimate explanations for these derived features, in particular the adoption of cooperative breeding as well as concern for reputation and costly signalling during human evolution.},

The Mumba Shelter is of particular interest because its upper sediments document a high stand of Lake Eyasi in end‐Pleistocene/early‐Holocene times, and midden deposits both above and below the lacustrine interlude are dominated by snail shells (Achatina sp.). A lithic industry apparently transitional between Middle and Late Stone Age industries is associated with the inception of the escargotière deposits, and a date for these phenomena indicates an age of c. 31,000 B.P. The excavation of witness sections at Mumba in 1977 has provided organic debris for radiometric dates and has served to clarify the Late Stone Age/Iron Age sequence of ceramic wares.},

 abstract = {The wild yam groves of the Kubu hunter-gatherers in the lowland forests ot Sumatra.  Despite of their toxicity, tubers from various species of widl yam provide a vital source of carbohydrates to the Kubu of the lowland forests of Sumatra. These nomadic hunter-gatherers have elaborated efficient processes to detoxify the tubers, and take advantage of this toxicity by creating wild yam groves in the forest understorey. Accordingly, the vine is naturally protected against putative predators, and the combination of various yam species that do not mature simultaneously, ensures a continuous production of tubers following the seasonal migrations of the Kubu. Such perennial exploitation of a pseudo-wild resource - described as paracultivation - is not a transitory step to domestication. Rather, it is a specific response to the constraints of a nomadic lifestyle. Such manipulations of plants demonstrate that hunting and gathering societies help shape the forest ecosystems.
Malgré leur toxicité, les tubercules d'ignames sauvages des forêts de Sumatra constituent une ressource vitale pour les Kubu. Ces chasseurs-collecteurs nomades disposent de techniques efficaces de détoxication des tubercules et mettent à profit cette toxicité en aménageant de véritables ignameraies dans le sous-bois. La plante est ainsi naturellement protégée contre ses principaux prédateurs. Composés de plusieurs espèces d'ignames à cycles de maturation bien distincts, ces "jardins" prodiguent une production constante de tubercules au fil des migrations saisonnières des Kubu. Cette exploitation pérenne d'une ressource pseudo-sauvage, qualifiée de paraculture, n'est nullement une étape transitoire vers une éventuelle domestication, mais constitue au contraire une stratégie aboutie répondant pleinement aux contraintes d'un mode de vie nomade. De telles manipulations du végétal prouvent que les chasseurs-collecteurs ont depuis fort longtemps façonné le milieu forestier.},

 abstract = {Environmental studies in adaptive human biology by North American anthropologists have a history of strong investigative research. From both laboratory and field work, we have gained major insights into human response to physical and social challenges. While these results were considered by most professionals to belong within evolutionary biology, in fact the intellectual structure sprang almost entirely from physiological equilibrium models. Consequently, physiological process itself was the focus. Further, most of the physiological patterns were not linked directly to important outcomes such as work output, reproductive success or survival. About 1975, American physiological anthropologists, led by Paul Baker, turned to studies of health, change and stress response. These studies were strong, but were still neither genetic nor evolutionary in intellectual structure. Evolutionary human biology was taken over by a new body of theory now called "behavior ecology", positing that selfish genes control human behavior to promote their own reproduction. This was paralleled by strong use of evolutionary theory in some areas of molecular biology. However, although physiological anthropologists have not focused on evolution, we have been developing powerful causal models that incorporate elements of physiology, morphology, physical environment and cultural behavior. In these "proximate" biocultural models, it is of little importance whether outcomes such as work or energy management are genetically based. Our future offers two major challenges. First, we must confirm causal links between specific physiological patterns and outcomes of practical importance to individuals and societies. Second, if we are to take our place in evolutionary biology, the one overarching theory of life on earth, we must understand the heritability of physiological traits, and determine whether they play a role in survival and reproduction.},

The results are tabulated and gene frequencies computed. For most systems, the frequencies in the two tribes are similar to one another and, in so far as data are available, similar to the neighbouring Bantu-speaking tribes.

 abstract = {Numbers of animal species react to the natural phenomenon of fire, but only humans have learnt to control it and to make it at will. Natural fires caused overwhelmingly by lightning are highly evident on many landscapes. Birds such as hawks, and some other predators, are alert to opportunities to catch animals including invertebrates disturbed by such fires and similar benefits are likely to underlie the first human involvements with fires. Early hominins would undoubtedly have been aware of such fires, as are savanna chimpanzees in the present. Rather than as an event, the discovery of fire use may be seen as a set of processes happening over the long term. Eventually, fire became embedded in human behaviour, so that it is involved in almost all advanced technologies. Fire has also influenced human biology, assisting in providing the high-quality diet which has fuelled the increase in brain size through the Pleistocene. Direct evidence of early fire in archaeology remains rare, but from 1.5 Ma onward surprising numbers of sites preserve some evidence of burnt material. By the Middle Pleistocene, recognizable hearths demonstrate a social and economic focus on many sites. The evidence of archaeological sites has to be evaluated against postulates of biological models such as the 'cooking hypothesis' or the 'social brain', and questions of social cooperation and the origins of language. Although much remains to be worked out, it is plain that fire control has had a major impact in the course of human evolution.This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.},

 abstract = {Humans regularly cooperate with non-kin, which has been theorized to require reciprocity between repeatedly interacting and trusting individuals. However, the role of repeated interactions has not previously been demonstrated in explaining real-world patterns of hunter-gatherer cooperation. Here we explore cooperation among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using data from both actual resource transfers and two experimental games across multiple camps. Patterns of cooperation vary greatly between camps and depend on socio-ecological context. Stable camps (with fewer changes in membership over time) were associated with greater reciprocal sharing, indicating that an increased likelihood of future interactions facilitates reciprocity. This is the first study reporting an association between reciprocal cooperation and hunter-gatherer band stability. Under conditions of low camp stability individuals still acquire resources from others, but do so via demand sharing (taking from others), rather than based on reciprocal considerations. Hunter-gatherer cooperation may either be characterized as reciprocity or demand sharing depending on socio-ecological conditions. },

 abstract = {The antiquity of the first Americans is one of the most controversial issues in American archaeology, and it must be resolved to understand fully the adaptive radiation of Homo sapiens into the New World. Humans were in the Americas at least by Clovis times 11,200 years ago. Accepting that these were the first Americans, however, is complicated by claims of an even earlier presence, by the absence of a Clovis source (i.e. an Alaskan predecessor is lacking), and by the theoretical demands of explaining how or why Clovis groups apparently migrated rapidly through the hemisphere. New models from evolutionary ecology, along with possible changes in the Clovis chronology (resulting from improved radiocarbon calibration), may address some of these anomalies. But there still remains the possibility of an earlier (pre-Clovis) entry, supported by some mtDNA and archaeological evidence. The mtDNA evidence, however, is complicated by questions about the viability of the presumed founder effect (on which the mtDNA clock is based). Also, the several possible pre-Clovis archaeological sites have not yet been accepted. Resolution of the timing of the peopling of the Americas, on which several theoretical and methodological issues hinge, remains a question of developing archaeological evidence, resolving ambiguity in analytical techniques and dating methods (and rejecting ones that now appear critically flawed), and expanding search strategies. The Monte Verde site in Chile is the most viable pre-Clovis candidate, although for now neither it nor any other site resolves when and by which route humans first came to the Americas.},

Here, we hypothesize that political support for modern welfare policies are shaped by these evolved mental programs. In particular, the compassionate motivation to share with needy nonfamily could not have evolved without defenses against opportunists inclined to take without contributing. Cognitively, such parasitic strategies can be identified by the intentional avoidance of productive effort. When detected, this pattern should trigger anger and down-regulate support for assistance. We tested predictions derived from these hypotheses in four studies in two cultures, showing that subjects' perceptions of recipients' effort to find work drive welfare opinions; that such perceptions (and not related perceptions) regulate compassion and anger (and not related emotions); that the effects of perceptions of recipients' effort on opinions about welfare are mediated by anger and compassion, independently of political ideology; and that these emotions not only influence the content of welfare opinions but also how easily they are formed.},

 abstract = {The technological innovation involving the controlled use of fire represents a decisive change in human subsistence. Hearths and the spatial distribution patterns associated with them constitute a valuable element in deepening our knowledge on human behaviour and its evolution. Studies focused on hearths and on the use of fire in general are diverse and carried out through different perspectives. Thus, hearths are studied for their meaning in terms of diet, caloric and light capacity and spatial organisation as well as for their role as communication and socialization focal points. The site of Qesem Cave (Israel) shows evidence of the controlled use of fire as early as 400 ka, judging by the burned bones from the lowest units of the stratigraphic sequence. A particular superimposed central hearth that was repeatedly used as a focus for human activities ca. 300 ka is the topic of this study. This succession of hearths at the same location in the cave yields dense faunal and lithic remains as well as evidence for spatial differentiation between areas. Here, we present faunal taphonomical data from this specific archaeological context, which includes not only the hearth area (approximately 4 m2) but also the surrounding areas (approximately 11 m2). The most common prey species is the Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama cf. mesopotamica), which displays a wide age range and a biased anatomical profile including mainly marrow-rich bones such as long-limb bones. These characteristics, especially those regarding the relative abundance of infantile and young fallow deer, lead us to propose that social hunting techniques were practised following a seasonal regime. This paper provides data on human subsistence behaviour during the formation of the hearth and the archaeological unit around it, comparing the two from a taphonomical perspective. Elements such as size (length) of bone fragments and intensity of burning are spatially plotted to show differential space division. All these data are considered in the reconstruction of subsistence strategies and hominin behaviour in the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex in the Levant.},

 abstract = {Recent results from the zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains from Vogelherd Cave, southwestern Germany, provide new insight into the subsistence behavior of early modern human groups during the Aurignacian. The results presented here represent the first comprehensive study of the archaeofauna from this site. Several episodes of occupation are inferred at this site, taking place primarily between 31 and 32 ka. Although a wide spectrum of Pleistocene mammals is represented in the Aurignacian at Vogelherd, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and horse (Equus ferus) were the primary prey taxa, and they are the most appropriate data sets with which to understand human subsistence on an intrasite level. Hunting of both taxa took place during the late summer and fall, coinciding with reindeer migrations and local abundance of horses. Complete or nearly complete prey carcasses were then transported from the kill locations to the cave for processing. This study shows that Vogelherd was a preferred locale of Aurignacian groups for a broad range of activities, including the time- and labor-intensive exploitation of ungulate prey for meat, marrow, and fat resources, as well as the production and maintenance of artifacts such as figurative artwork, personal ornaments, bone and ivory armatures, and lithic tools. With its rich faunal and artifact assemblages, the Aurignacian deposit at Vogelherd provides a wealth of information on this critical period of the early Upper Paleolithic, when cultural innovations were flourishing.},

 abstract = {Most advances in our understanding of predation risk involve foraging animals, yet animals also trade off predation risk with other essential activities. Drinking under the risk of predation may elicit similar prey behaviours to those in foraging animals, but has been little studied. Agile wallabies, Macropus agilis, manipulate their environment by excavating drinking holes just out of reach of predatory saltwater crocodiles. Paradoxically, however, some wallabies drink from the river's edge despite the immediate availability of the lower-risk drinking holes. We studied the behaviour of wallabies with multiple drinking options to test a series of predictions for animals drinking under the risk of predation. More wallabies drank during the day than at night, regardless of drinking site. However, night-drinking wallabies were much more likely to use the excavated holes than the ‘riskier’ river. This spatiotemporal dichotomy in perceived predation risk may reflect a mismatch in nocturnal sensory capabilities between predator and prey, and would provide sufficient motivation for wallabies to create low-risk drinking holes. Drinking duration, our surrogate for harvest, was not influenced by drinking site type (hole versus river), drinking time or social context (solitary versus group), suggesting that some animals may not forego drinking during high-risk periods, as predicted and observed for some foraging animals. Compared to wallabies in groups, solitary wallabies were less likely to drink from the river, especially at night, and were more vigilant. Although evidence is limited, our research suggests that vigilance may be ineffective for nocturnally drinking wallabies in the face of this concealed, ambush predator.},

 abstract = {The concept of a home-based land use strategy is fundamental for studying recent and prehistoric foraging populations. A proposed datum for the emergence of this behavior is set during later Middle Pleistocene times, around 400–350 kya, and temporally linked with the first established evidence for domestic fire making. Precise causes for this dual appearance remain obscure. Surveying the known Paleolithic record and contexts serves to identify possible factors and processes leading to this development. The emphasis here is on fire technology, particularly domestic fire making and uses, and fire's relationship with home base sensu lato characteristics, as contrasted with a previous land use system that reflects earlier primate patterns. Intentional bush and grassland burning could be components of this home base and domestic fire system. The issue of domestic fire and home base at Locality 1 in Zhoukoudian Cave is evaluated from the perspective of contemporaneous hominid behavior in Eurasia and Africa.},

In brief, the paper represents a micro‐study that addresses the Ahrensburgian culture group during the close of the Late Palaeolithic in north central Europe, and its relationship to the Hensbacka group found in central Bohuslän on the coast of western Sweden. Although we do not disagree that environmental conditions are a ‘prime mover’ of cultural change, we hold that it is not the only ‘mover’. In addition, we also discuss the distinct possibility that the term ‘microlithization’ cannot be used as a synonym for the Mesolithic. The foundation of our micro‐study is based on interdisciplinary concepts from the fields of archaeology, economic anthropology, geosciences, and marine zoology.},

 abstract = {Martin (1999a) proposes that present-day society differs from mankind's evolutionary past by a change from immediate returns, when living as hunter–gatherers, to a delayed-return system with the onset of agriculture and urban living. He assumes that a delayed-return system lacks frequent feedback necessary for goal orientation and perceived control, which may lead to various social psychological thinking errors, cognitive distortions and an external locus of control. This study was aimed at examining whether Martin's I-D compensation theory could be applied in a sample of incarcerated juvenile delinquents in The Netherlands who frequently lack adequate feedback and control. Using questionnaires (N = 144) and semi-structured interviews (N = 40) with adolescents in secure institutional facilities, the results showed that feedback in the form of responsiveness of group workers was positively related to behavioural competence and subsequently to fewer criminal cognitions and self-serving cognitive distortions. In addition, self-serving cognitive distortions were positively associated with an external locus of control. These results provide insight into antecedents of criminal behaviour, and can be used to develop efficacious institutional treatment for juvenile delinquents.},

 abstract = { Both environmental and cultural factors dictate how, when and where hunter-gatherers use fire in the landscape, as well as how well evidence for any one fire will preserve in the archaeological record. Variability in the production and preservation of anthropogenic fire traces can potentially skew our perception of fire use in the past. With this in mind, the research presented in this article weighs in on the debate concerning Neandertal fire use and fire making, specifically, the assertion that Neandertals were unable to produce fire for themselves (Sandgathe et al., 2011a, 2011b). This hypothesis is based on the inferred correlation between climatic deterioration, concurrent lowering of lightning-ignited fire frequencies, and reduced signals for fire use in layers presumably deposited during the Lower Pleniglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 4) at the Middle Palaeolithic sites of Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV (Aquitaine Basin, southwestern France), the logic being that if Neandertals could produce fire at will, fire use signals would remain largely consistent throughout the deposits despite there being limited access to natural fires in the landscape during this colder period. This review challenges these assertions at multiple scales by looking at regional lightning and fire regime dynamics, comparing the fire signals observed at Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV to those of other sites nearby and around France, and exploring the various environmental and cultural factors likely influencing these signals. Ultimately, the data suggests that estimated reductions in lightning frequencies and fire regime during the Lower Pleniglacial (and colder stadial periods, in general) were not adequate to severely limit Neandertal access to natural fire, while possible artefactual evidence for Neandertal fire making challenges the assumption that they were at all reliant on lightning-ignited fire. Moreover, at the nearby Neandertal site of Combe Grenal, the majority of the layers exhibiting evidence of fire use have cold climatic signals, suggesting the fire use trends observed at Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV are potentially local expressions of changes in regional site use patterns, possibly brought on by increased reliance on highly mobile, migratory reindeer prey species and reductions in local woodfuel availability during cold periods. Other factors potentially reducing the archaeological visibility of cold climate fire use are discussed.},

 abstract = {Reptiles have served as an important source of protein for human populations around the world. Exploitation for food is heaviest in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, but also occurs in temperate areas. Of all reptiles, turtles are the most heavily exploited for human consumption. High, unsustainable levels of exploitation for food are directly responsible for the precarious conservation status of many turtles. Crocodilians, snakes, and lizards may be locally important food sources, however, with the exception of a few lizard species, they are exploited in a less intense and generally non-commercial manner for human consumption. In comparison, the commercial skin trade poses a far greater threat to the survival of crocodilians as well as certain large snakes and lizards. Recent field reports have implicated the south east Asian medicinal trade as a growing threat to reptiles, especially turtles and snakes. There are few unequivocal examples of managed harvest programmes for reptiles that are economically and culturally viable, as well as biologically sustainable. Given the economic importance of reptiles as sources of protein and other highly valued commodities, it is imperative that more attention be focused on the development of sustainable use programmes for these species.},

                  Renewed excavations at FLK Zinj and its surrounding landscape have yielded valuable information regarding its paleoecological situation and the prehistoric behavioral function of the site. The density of materials at the main cluster of the site excavated by Leakey contrasts with the bone and lithic scatters surrounding the site. The location of FLK Zinj, situated a few hundred meters away from a freshwater spring, would have enabled hominins access to water, plants and game. The appeal of the spot for hominins (also explained by the presence of a wooded habitat) is confirmed by inferences of its redundant use prior and during the formation of the FLK Zinj paleosol, as witnessed by materials accumulated both under and on the waxy clay deposit that constitutes the FLK Zinj stratum. The single-cluster nature of the site indicates central-place behavior and evidence is provided that hominins occupied the site at a time of very low predation hazards in the area.},

 abstract = {The 1910-1913 Terra Nova Expedition to the Antarctic, led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, was a venture of science and discovery. It is also a well-known story of heroism and tragedy since his quest to reach the South Pole and conduct research en route, while successful was also fateful. Although Scott and his four companions hauled their sledges to the Pole, they died on their return journey either directly or indirectly from the extreme physiological stresses they experienced. One hundred years on, our understanding of such stresses caused by Antarctic extremes and how the body reacts to severe exercise, malnutrition, hypothermia, high altitude, and sleep deprivation has greatly advanced. On the centenary of Scott's expedition to the bottom of the Earth, there is still controversy surrounding whether the deaths of those five men could have, or should have, been avoided. This paper reviews present-day knowledge related to the physiology of sustained man-hauling in Antarctica and contrasts this with the comparative ignorance about these issues around the turn of the 20th century. It closes by considering whether, with modern understanding about the effects of such a scenario on the human condition, Scott could have prepared and managed his team differently and so survived the epic 1,600-mile journey. The conclusion is that by carrying rations with a different composition of macromolecules, enabling greater calorific intake at similar overall weight, Scott might have secured the lives of some of the party, and it is also possible that enhanced levels of vitamin C in his rations, albeit difficult to achieve in 1911, could have significantly improved their survival chances. Nevertheless, even with today's knowledge, a repeat attempt at his expedition would by no means be bound to succeed.},

 abstract = {New research and excavations at Bell Korongo (BK, Olduvai Gorge, Upper Bed II) have uncovered a dense concentration of megafauna that contributes to our understanding of Homo erectus subsistence strategies around 1.34 Ma. Recent work has yielded clear taphonomic evidence for the exploitation of large-sized animals. The frequency and distribution of cut marks, for example, indicates that hominins enjoyed early access to substantial amounts of meat. This degree of carcass processing, particularly megafauna, suggests that the human group(s) exploiting them were large and had significant nutritional needs. Here, we build upon this work by presenting the first comprehensive taphonomic analysis of the faunal material excavated by the Leakeys at BK between 1952 and 1957 corresponding to 24 Pelorovis oldowayensis. Leakey’s assemblage was biased due to selective collection of the most readily identifiable specimens, among which long bone shafts were not included. The recent assemblage reflects the relevance of using long bone shafts to overcome the equifinality of the alternative scenarios proposed to explain the accumulation of Pelorovis. The analysis of The Olduvai Paleoanthropology and Paleoecology Project’s (TOPPP) recent assemblage sheds light on the reconstruction of hominin strategies of carcass acquisition at BK.},

The absence of marrow processing at 'Ubeidiya provides a marked contrast to the bone marrow focussed subsistence based on scavenging proposed by some researchers for African early hominids, and this question is discussed in a broader context.It is concluded that hunting of medium-sized mammals was probably one of the subsistence strategies available to Early Pleistocene Levantine hominids.},

These data are used to determine the caloric return rates from processing skeletal elements of animals in different stages of fat depletion. Analysis of these data have three important results. First, for some taxa the feet and head are more efficiently processed than certain limb bones. Second, the exploitation of malnourished carcasses may not be reflected by the selective processing of the bones with marrow that retain fat. Finally, processing costs vary as a function of carcass size and are higher than previous estimates. Skeletal part representation of medium and larger- sized taxa from FLKZinjanthropusare reanalysed in light of these data. Results of this analysis challenge previous characterizations of early hominids as efficient and selective scavengers with access to high quality animal carcasses.

Scavenging arguments are based partly on the observation that felids tend to abandon their prey with large quantities of intact marrow. Passively scavenging hominids would therefore have been forced to focus on withinbone nutrients. Such a scenario would have created tooth marks resulting from felid defleshing and percussion marks from hominid marrow extraction. Regarding cut marks, supporters of scavenging models suggest that these marks reflect the removal of the marginal flesh scraps that commonly survive initial carnivore consumption. However, this interpretation of cut marks remains either unsupported by experimental or observational studies (Blumenschine, 1991) or incorrectly modeled (see, for example, the critique of Selvaggio [1994] in Domínguez-Rodrigo [1997a]).},

While many Mousterian sites from Western Europe exhibit faunal assemblages clearly dominated by a particular taxon, faunal spectrum alone is not enough to discuss the hunting strategies developed for their acquisition and the relative importance of the prey in Neanderthal diet. Therefore, Neanderthal hunting strategies are examined using different proxies such as prey selection and carcass exploitation in two Late Pleistocene sites: Mauran and Les Pradelles. These sites share all the characteristics (high quantity of faunal material, specialized faunal spectrum, large number of prey, catastrophic mortality profile, seasonal slaughter, possible selective transport of the richest elements) usually recognized in communal hunting assemblages. The conclusions underline that the subsistence economy of the hunter-gatherers in question involves the planned procurement of animal resources with the intention of storing surplus in anticipation of future food needs. It demonstrates that Neanderthal populations in Southwestern Europe already possessed the necessary technical and cognitive capacities.},

 abstract = {Resolving the issue of how Early Stone Age hominins acquired large mammal carcasses requires information on their feeding interactions with large carnivores. This ecological information and its behavioral and evolutionary implications are revealed most directly from the tooth, cut, and percussion marks on bone surfaces generated by hominin and carnivore feeding activities. This paper employs a bootstrap method, a form of random resampling with replacement, to refine published neotaphonomic models that use the assemblage-wide proportions of long bones bearing feeding traces to infer the sequences in which Plio-Pleistocene hominins and carnivores accessed flesh, marrow, and/or grease from carcasses. Results validate the sensitivity of the models for inferring hominin feeding ecology, which have been questioned on grounds shown here to be unfounded. The bootstrapped feeding trace models are applied to the late Pliocene larger mammal fossil assemblage from FLK 22 (Zinjanthropus site), Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. High frequencies of tooth and percussion marking on long bone midshaft fragments from FLK 22 are most consistent with those feeding trace models that simulate hominin scavenging from carcasses defleshed by carnivores, while cut mark data indicate that hominins more often had access to upper forelimb flesh than upper hind limb flesh. Together, the bone surface modification data indicate that hominins typically gained secondary access to partially defleshed carnivore kills, but they also allow for the possibility of some carcasses being processed only by carnivores and only by hominins.},

 abstract = {The manipulation of fire by early hominins was a turning point in our evolutionary history. Once "domesticated", fire provided warmth, light and protection from predators, as well as enabling the exploitation of a new range of foods. This book presents the spatial analyses of burned and unburned flint items which provide evidence for the controlled use of fire at the 790,000-year-old Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (GBY). Clusters of burned flint, interpreted as the remnants of hearths, occur throughout the entire occupational sequence of the site. The fact that fire is repetitively used suggests that the knowledge of fire-making and the technological skills of the Acheulian hominins of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov enabled them to set fire at will in diverse environmental settings. "Control of fire marks a significant landmark in human evolution, providing warmth, protection, and many new foods. This important volume compellingly shows that fire was already in regular use some 800,000 years ago." John D. Speth, Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA "A major contribution to knowledge of early human fire history, the finds at Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov add immensely to the picture of our early ancestors by the fireside. The authors present a painstaking and multidimensional scientific investigation which should convince even sceptics of the importance of fire use in prehistory" John A.J.

 abstract = {This chapter examines large-scale patterns of behavioral change that are often viewed as indicators for the advent of cultural modernity and developed symbolic communication. Using examples from Africa and Eurasia, the chapter reviews patterns of lithic and organic technology, subsistence, and settlement as potential indicators of modern behavior. These areas of research produce a mosaic picture of advanced technology and behavioral patterns that come and go during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene. Based on these data the emergence of modern behavior, as seen in the archaeologically visible material record, appears to be gradual and heterogeneous in space and time. During the early part of the Late Pleistocene, personal ornaments in the form of perforated seashells are documented in southwestern Asia and northern and southern Africa. By about 40,000 years ago (Ka), a diverse array of personal ornaments are documented across the Old World in association with Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. These include both modified natural objects and fully formed ornaments. The timing and distribution of the appearance of figurative art, mythical imagery, and other classes of artifacts including musical instruments point to a more punctuated development of fully modern behavior during the middle of the Late Pleistocene and certainly no later than 40 Ka. Due perhaps in part to the long and intense history of research, much, but by no means all, of the relevant data come from Europe. Early figurative art from the Aurignacian of southwestern Germany, northern Italy, Austria, and southern France provides undisputed evidence for fully developed symbolic communication and behavioral modernity. This chapter also discusses some of the hypotheses for the development and spread of cultural modernity and rejects a strict monogenetic model in favor of a pattern of mosaic polycentric development. This chapter highlights the need for new refutable, regional and superregional hypotheses for the advent and spread of behavioral modernity.},

 abstract = {The energetic return rates of many small animal and plant resources are often density dependent. When these resources are collected in mass, change in abundance can dramatically affect diet rank, and challenges the assumption that return rates are generally correlated with body size. When mass collecting is employed, as a result of either natural events (e.g. windrows) or technological developments (e.g. nets), population density may largely determine the overall return rate for a resource. Since a single food or resource type can be many prey types, an increase in the abundance of a food resource can change its diet rank. We examined this relationship at Lakeside Cave in northwestern Utah, and discovered that when the abundance of grasshoppers is high, and mass collecting is productive, the hunting of bighorn sheep and other large animal resources may have been abandoned, contradicting commonly held assumptions about prey size. In archaeological situations it may be necessary to determine what foraging technique was used before assuming that the presence of small animals and fish in the diet is a result of reduced foraging efficiency.},

We perform an exploratory data analysis to observe reduction intensity tendencies among the different assemblages, and we characterize reduction distribution patterns using Weibull probability distribution functions. To avoid sampling effects, resampling and bootstrapping were performed. The Weibull profiles of the analyzed data show different degrees of occupational intensity and/or length that are not observable through the classical techno-typological approaches. A referential reduction space is also simulated to create a frame to interpret our results in a more absolute scale.},

 abstract = { The Neolithic site of Fruntișeni (Eastern Romania, Vaslui County) belongs to the Stoicani-Aldeni culture and it is located on an important contact zone between neighbouring Neolithic cultures — Gumelnița, Cucuteni and Petrești. Zooarchaeological evidence concerning this culture is scarce and consists of a small set of data represented by identified taxa from assemblages. In this paper we present the classification of cut marks observed on bone surfaces and their functionality. The bones bearing cut marks belong both to domestic mammals (Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, Sus domesticus) and wild mammals (Bos primigenius, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, Sus ferus). Studying the bone surface modification produced by meat supplying contributes to a better understanding of the managing of carcass dismemberment, issues of nourishment, and knowledge about butchery techniques from that period. When the studied material consists of food garbage, many cut marks are obscured by the high fragmentation ratio. Thus, even without entire skeletons which can show us the exact butchery pattern used, we can still claim as we illustrated in this paper that the butchery pattern can vary between species. This study is the first of this kind for a faunal assemblage from Romania.},

 abstract = {Cutmarks provide empirical evidence for the exploitation of animal resources by past human groups. Their study may contribute substantially to our knowledge of economic behavior, including the procurement of prey and the analysis of butchery sequences. Butchering practices can be investigated using cutmark illustrations recorded on bone templates. In this paper, quantitative data on cutmarks were derived from published and unpublished cutmark drawings for 27 French assemblages dated between the late Middle Paleolithic and the final Upper Paleolithic. The analysis of cutmark data on meaty long bones (humerus, radio-ulna, femur, tibia) highlights strong variations in cutmark length and orientation in the sample that potentially reflect significant shifts in meat processing strategies during the Late Pleistocene. The present study shows that long longitudinal cutmarks are considerably more frequent during the Late Glacial Maximum than in the early Upper Paleolithic. Although the number of studies is small, actualistic data generated in controlled settings indicate that long longitudinal cutmarks are commonly produced during filleting, an activity closely associated with meat preservation, as is the case with drying and smoking. Because they provide information on possible changes in the capacity for anticipation, these results have potentially important implications for the logistical and economic organization of Paleolithic hominins.},

 abstract = {In each semantic domain studied to date, there is considerable variation in how meanings are expressed across languages. But are some semantic domains more likely to show variation than others? Is the domain of space more or less variable in its expression than other semantic domains, such as containers, body parts, or colours? According to many linguists, the meanings expressed in grammaticised expressions, such as (spatial) adpositions, are more likely to be similar across languages than meanings expressed in open class lexical items. On the other hand, some psychologists predict there ought to be more variation across languages in the meanings of adpositions, than in the meanings of nouns. This is because relational categories, such as those expressed as adpositions, are said to be constructed by language; whereas object categories expressed as nouns are predicted to be “given by the world”. We tested these hypotheses by comparing the semantic systems of closely related languages. Previous cross-linguistic studies emphasise the importance of studying diverse languages, but we argue that a focus on closely related languages is advantageous because domains can be compared in a culturally- and historically-informed manner. Thus we collected data from 12 Germanic languages. Naming data were collected from at least 20 speakers of each language for containers, body-parts, colours, and spatial relations. We found the semantic domains of colour and body-parts were the most similar across languages. Containers showed some variation, but spatial relations expressed in adpositions showed the most variation. The results are inconsistent with the view expressed by most linguists. Instead, we find meanings expressed in grammaticised meanings are more variable than meanings in open class lexical items.},

New fossils, more sites, better dates, modern and fossil DNA, and scores of analyses have mostly disproved the multiregional model of human evolution. By and large, the evidence generally supports some version of the out‐of‐Africa model, according to which humans first evolved in Africa at least 200,000 years ago and then migrated to other parts of the world. Remaining debates about human origins primarily address if and how much hybridization occurred between modern humans and taxa of archaic Homo such as H. neanderthalensis. },

 abstract = {While archaeologists have long been interested in how human prey choice decisions vary both spatially and temporally, recent research has often focused on the role climate and human overhunting play in the process. Regardless of the issue receiving particular attention, these studies have also faced the dilemma of determining to what degree observed patterns are driven by underlying taphonomic processes rather than the factor of interest. Here, the faunal record from two Fremont residential sites located in Utah’s Parowan Valley (southeastern Great Basin) shows patterns of taxonomic representation, age structure, element representation, and fragmentation which covary through time both with each other and with local tree-ring records. Analysis of these materials: (1) contradicts previously reported work suggesting that human overhunting alone drove prey choice decisions in the area, (2) clarifies the relationship between environmental variability and anthropogenically induced changes in the local resource base, (3) provides a possible explanation for variability apparent in long-term studies of Fremont prey choice, and (4) illustrates how climatic impacts on farming and foraging opportunities may have structured element representation through its affect on human processing decisions and the nature of the bones subsequently presented to secondary consumers. This last issue has broader zooarchaeological implications in that it attempts to address the behavioral factors affecting density-mediated attrition and how they may vary with local ecology.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Actualism has been a fundamental tool in taphonomy. The knowledge of accumulation patterning of modern faunal allows us to interpret the activity of different actors in the archaeological record and to reconstruct the behaviour of preterit animals and humans in which we are interested. However, until now, there are few works that include bone modifications made by bears amongst those made by carnivores. Most data about bone modifications made by bears have been obtained from the archaeo‐palaeontological record. In most of these assemblages, the presence of bears is related to their period of hibernation. Therefore, in these contexts, the changes documented on recovered bear bones are associated only with cannibalism. In this paper, we present an actualistic study about modifications on bones made by modern brown bears. These animals can cause damage similar to those produced by other large carnivores. Generally, bear activity leaves slight damage, mainly on large‐sized animal bones. However, on bones of small‐sized animals and those of greater fragility, the bears can produce abundant damage. Though not usual, bears can break long bones and consume the complete epiphysis. This study suggests that bears have the potential to be agents of bone modification in fossil assemblages. Consequently, they should be considered as a possible agent of modification of faunal remains in the fossil record. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {The issue of site function rarely has been a main focus in the study of Portuguese Upper Paleolithic. This fact may be related to a lack of interest in this research area. More likely, however, it is due to the fact that there are relatively few Paleolithic sites with data that allow a serious study of site function. At Picareiro Cave, central Portugal, there are various data sets from level F/G dated to the latter Magdalenian that are adequate for this type of research. These are habitat structures, lithic artifacts, macro- and mesofauna, as well as 3D location of all artifacts and fauna larger than 1cm. Based on the interpretation of the analytical results of each data set, it is possible to reconstruct site function of this particular level of Picareiro Cave. The morphology of one of the hearths, being very large in size, with the base prepared and a pavement surrounding it, as well as the condition and diversity of fauna, indicates that it was used for processing the meat of rabbits, red deer, and wild boar, probably through smoking and grilling. All of the evidence from the different types of data (lithic artifacts, habitat structures, use of space, and fauna) indicate that Layers F/G of Picareiro Cave are the result of a specific task, that of processing animal carcasses of rabbits, red deer, and wild boar.},

 abstract = {Economic utility indices provide a means of interpreting butchery and transport decisions reflected in the relative abundance of skeletal elements. Because of destructive taphonomic processes, interpreting skeletal element abundances in terms of carcass transport strategies requires that faunal analysts consider only those elements which accurately reflect their original abundances following human discard. In this study we use resampling techniques to examine the impact of sample size on correlations between high-survival skeletal element frequencies and economic utility in four simulated population assemblages reflecting distinct carcass transport strategies. Correlations alone do not accurately reflect the true relationship between bone abundance and economic utility as particular transport strategies have a tendency to generate high frequencies of Type II errors as sample size decreases. We show that the Shannon evenness index can be used as a quantitative means of distinguishing between bone assemblages characterized by subtle variations in skeletal element abundances. The evenness index can also be used to evaluate whether observed correlations reflect sampling error. Results from our simulations are applied to three published faunal assemblages to evaluate likely carcass transport strategies.},

 abstract = {Abstract As in the rest of Polynesia, human colonization of New Zealand marked the beginning of tremendous change for the native flora and fauna resulting in significant habitat destruction and numerous extinctions. The loss of numerous native vertebrates, especially economically important taxa such as moas and seals, must have greatly affected the foraging economy of southern New Zealand. The effect that declining abundances of native fauna had on subsistence can be understood through the use of foraging theory models. The prey choice model, in particular, can be used to examine how foragers choose the resources they exploit. From this model we can predict changes in the diet that occur with the loss of important resources. In this paper, I explore the use of diversity indices as one means of measuring these dietary changes. Richness and evenness measures of the faunal data from the Shag River Mouth site are used to evaluate predictions made by the prey choice model about changing diet breadth and foraging efficiency.

In the lower levels, the very low density of artefacts as well as the carnivores scavenging of carcasses abandoned by the neanderthals point to short-term human occupations; the introduction of finished tools (made on non-local, good quality flint) later highly curated, together with an expedient strategy on strictly local flint, suggest a task-specific location, within a low mobility pattern. The large faunal sample (mainly reindeer) underlines the preponderance of hunting activities. A range of butchering activities took place on the site and the abundance of filleting marks may be an indication of the processing of meat for transport to another settlement.

 abstract = {Little is known about the history of click-speaking populations in Africa. Prior genetic studies revealed that the click-speaking Hadza of eastern Africa are as distantly related to click speakers of southern Africa as are most other African populations. The Sandawe, who currently live within 150 km of the Hadza, are the only other population in eastern Africa whose language has been classified as part of the Khoisan language family. Linguists disagree on whether there is any detectable relationship between the Hadza and Sandawe click languages. We characterized both mtDNA and Y chromosome variation of the Sandawe, Hadza, and neighboring Tanzanian populations. New genetic data show that the Sandawe and southern African click speakers share rare mtDNA and Y chromosome haplogroups; however, common ancestry of the 2 populations dates back >35,000 years. These data also indicate that common ancestry of the Hadza and Sandawe populations dates back >15,000 years. These findings suggest that at the time of the spread of agriculture and pastoralism, the click-speaking populations were already isolated from one another and are consistent with relatively deep linguistic divergence among the respective click languages.},

 abstract = {Ancestral human populations had diets containing more indigestible plant material than present-day diets in industrialized countries. One hypothesis for the rise in prevalence of obesity is that physiological mechanisms for controlling appetite evolved to match a diet with plant fiber content higher than that of present-day diets. We investigated how diet affects gut microbiota and colon cells by comparing human microbial communities with those from a primate that has an extreme plant-based diet, namely, the gelada baboon, which is a grazer. The effects of potato (high starch) versus grass (high lignin and cellulose) diets on human-derived versus gelada-derived fecal communities were compared in vitro. We especially focused on the production of short-chain fatty acids, which are hypothesized to be key metabolites influencing appetite regulation pathways. The results confirmed that diet has a major effect on bacterial numbers, short-chain fatty acid production, and the release of hormones involved in appetite suppression. The potato diet yielded greater production of short-chain fatty acids and hormone release than the grass diet, even in the gelada cultures, which we had expected should be better adapted to the grass diet. The strong effects of diet on hormone release could not be explained, however, solely by short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy found changes in additional metabolites, including betaine and isoleucine, that might play key roles in inhibiting and stimulating appetite suppression pathways. Our study results indicate that a broader array of metabolites might be involved in triggering gut hormone release in humans than previously thought.
IMPORTANCE: One theory for rising levels of obesity in western populations is that the body's mechanisms for controlling appetite evolved to match ancestral diets with more low-energy plant foods. We investigated this idea by comparing the effects of diet on appetite suppression pathways via the use of gut bacterial communities from humans and gelada baboons, which are modern-day primates with an extreme diet of low-energy plant food, namely, grass. We found that diet does play a major role in affecting gut bacteria and the production of a hormone that suppresses appetite but not in the direction predicted by the ancestral diet hypothesis. Also, bacterial products were correlated with hormone release that were different from those normally thought to play this role. By comparing microbiota and diets outside the natural range for modern humans, we found a relationship between diet and appetite pathways that was more complex than previously hypothesized on the basis of more-controlled studies of the effects of single compounds.},

 abstract = {Two fossil specimens from the DIK-55 locality in the Hadar Formation at Dikika, Ethiopia, are contemporaneous with the earliest documented stone tools, and they collectively bear twelve marks interpreted to be characteristic of stone tool butchery damage. An alternative interpretation of the marks has been that they were caused by trampling animals and do not provide evidence of stone tool use or large ungulate exploitation by Australopithecus-grade hominins. Thus, resolving which agents created marks on fossils in deposits from Dikika is an essential step in understanding the ecological and taphonomic contexts of the hominin-bearing deposits in this region and establishing their relevance for investigations of the earliest stone tool use. This paper presents results of microscopic scrutiny of all non-hominin fossils collected from the Hadar Formation at Dikika, including additional fossils from DIK-55, and describes in detail seven assemblages from sieved surface sediment samples. The study is the first taphonomic description of Pliocene fossil assemblages from open-air deposits in Africa that were collected without using only methods that emphasize the selective retention of taxonomically-informative specimens. The sieved assemblages show distinctive differences in faunal representation and taphonomic modifications that suggest they sample a range of depositional environments in the Pliocene Hadar Lake Basin, and have implications for how landscape-based taphonomy can be used to infer past microhabitats. The surface modification data show that no marks on any other fossils resemble in size or shape those on the two specimens from DIK-55 that were interpreted to bear stone tool inflicted damage. A large sample of marks from the sieved collections has characteristics that match modern trampling damage, but these marks are significantly smaller than those on the DIK-55 specimens and have different suites of characteristics. Most are not visible without magnification. The data show that the DIK-55 marks are outliers amongst bone surface damage in the Dikika area, and that trampling is not the most parsimonious interpretation of their origin. },

 abstract = {Bioenergetics, the study of the use and transfer of energy, can provide important insights into the ecology and evolution of early hominids. Despite a relatively large brain with high metabolic demands, contemporary humans and other primates have resting metabolic rates (RMRs) that are similar to those of other mammals. As a result, a comparatively large proportion of their resting energy budget is spent on brain metabolism among humans (~20–25%) and other primates (~8–10%) compared to other mammals (~3–5%). To understand this shift in energy budget, Aiello and Wheeler's Expensive Tissue Hypothesis (ETH) posits a metabolic trade-off — a reduction in gut size with brain size increase — to explain this phenomenon. Here, we explore the interrelationships between brain size, body size, diet, and body composition using comparative data for humans, non-human primates, and other mammals. Among living primates, the relative proportion of energy allocated to brain metabolism is positively correlated with dietary quality. Contemporary humans fall at the positive end of this relationship, having both a high quality diet and a large brain. Thus, high costs associated with the large human brain are supported, in part, by energy-rich diets. Although contemporary humans display relatively small guts, primates as a group have gut sizes that are similar to non-primate mammals. In contrast, humans and other primates have significantly less skeletal muscle for their size compared to other mammals. These comparative analyses suggest that alterations in diet quality and body composition were necessary conditions for overcoming the constraints on encephalization. Fossil evidence indicates that brain expansion with the emergence of Homo erectus at about 1.8 million years ago was likely associated with important changes in diet, body composition, and body size.},

Theoretically estimated also, using Nei's extended Dahlberg's formula, is a chronological decrease in the proportion of first-cousin marriages among the parents of affected individuals. The estimated decrease in both indices during the period was substantial, and greater in disorders of low gene frequencies. The incidence of major autosomal recessive disorders was estimated to have decreased by 40 to 80% during the period. The proportion of first-cousin marriages among the parents of affected individuals dropped from 40-70% in 1945 to 5-15% in 1983. Theoretical estimates of the magnitude of the decrease in the incidence and in the proportion of first-cousin marriages among the parents agreed fairly well with those of observed figures in phenylketonuria and Wilson's disease.},

 abstract = {The common occurrence of hammerstone percussion damage (pits, striae, notches and impact flakes) on the fossil limb bones of ungulates indicates that marrow extraction has been an important component of hominid butchery for over two million years. Beyond this level of basic inference, it would be behaviorally informative if three deeper aspects of marrow harvesting were understood more clearly: (1) whether inter-element patterns of bone fragmentation vary when processing intensity is held constant; (2) whether butcher investment in marrow extraction correlates positively with the number of percussion marks generated; (3) whether taphonomic effectors can be identified based on percussion mark morphology, frequency and placement. Some experimental work has been conducted previously in service of exploring these questions, but we set out here to address them explicitly through the analysis of a large sample of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) limb elements fractured by hammerstone percussion. Our results indicate that (1) measures of bone fragmentation, which supposedly reflect processing intensity, are highly contingent on the research question being posed. This stresses the fact that researchers must be explicit in their definition of processing intensity. (2) In addition, hypothesized covariance between number of hammerstone blows and percussion mark frequencies are not met in our sample, corroborating previous conclusions of a lack of covariance between cutting strokes and cutmark frequencies. These results highlight the contingent nature of butchery mark production, and emphasize the need to investigate carcass resource exploitation by posing questions that do not rely on mark frequencies, but instead utilize other zooarchaeological measures. (3) Finally, our results—showing high incidences of impact notches and flakes created by direct anvil contact and “anvil scratches” created by direct hammerstone contact—suggest caution in using specific categories of percussion damage to infer their taphonomic effectors.},

Our model is framed as a multi-player public goods game that involves no repeated or assortative interactions, so that non-cooperation would be a dominant strategy if there were no signaling benefits. We show that honest signaling of underlying quality by providing a public good to group members can be evolutionarily stable, and can proliferate in a population in which it is initially rare, provided that certain plausible conditions hold, including a link between group-beneficial signaling and underlying qualities of the signaler that would be of benefit to a potential mate or alliance partner. Our model applies to a range of cooperative interactions, including unconditionally sharing individually consumable resources, participating in group raiding or defense, and punishing free-riding or other violations of social norms.},

 abstract = {Diet is key to understanding the paleoecology of early hominins. We know little about the diets of these fossil taxa, however, in part because of a limited fossil record, and in part because of limitations in methods available to infer their feeding adaptations. This paper applies a new method, dental topographic analysis, to the inference of diet from fossil hominin teeth. This approach uses laser scanning to generate digital 3D models of teeth and geographic information systems software to measure surface attributes, such as slope and occlusal relief. Because it does not rely on specific landmarks that change with wear, dental topographic analysis allows measurement and comparison of variably worn teeth, greatly increasing sample sizes compared with techniques that require unworn teeth. This study involved comparison of occlusal slope and relief of the lower second molars of Australopithecus afarensis (n=15) and early Homo (n=8) with those of Gorilla gorilla gorilla (n=47) and Pan troglodytes troglodytes (n=54). Results indicate that while all groups show reduced slope and relief in progressively more worn specimens, there are consistent differences at given wear stages among the taxa. Early Homo shows steeper slopes and more relief than chimpanzees, whereas A. afarensis shows less slope and relief than any of the other groups. The differences between the two hominin taxa are on the same order as those between the extant apes, suggesting similar degrees of difference in diet. Because these chimpanzees and gorillas differ mostly in fallback foods where they are sympatric, results suggest that the early hominins may likewise have differed mostly in fallback foods, with A. afarensis emphasizing harder, more brittle foods, and early Homo relying on tougher, more elastic foods.},

 abstract = {An architectural utility index, based on bone length, shape and weight, and a meat utility index, based on estimated associated flesh weight per skeletal portion, are derived for the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), the largest prey species hunted by any prehistoric or historic traditional native society. The indices are weakly, but negatively correlated. Crania, mandibles, maxillae/premaxillae and cervical vertebrae, the highest ranked elements from an architectural perspective, have very low meat utility values, while the hyoid and caudal vertebrae have the highest meat utility values, but very low architectural utility. The respective utility indices are applied to zooarchaeological bowhead whale assemblages in five different contexts at prehistoric Thule Eskimo sites in the Canadian Arctic: residential and ceremonial dwellings; burials; caches; kayak/umiak rests; and a bowhead processing area. The results suggest that architectural utility, as opposed to meat utility, was the primary determinant in the production of Thule whale bone assemblages in essentially all contexts, including initial whale processing. The investigation of zooarchaeological assemblages of other megafauna in other archaeological contexts may also benefit significantly from a similar “architectural approach”.},

 abstract = {One of the most widespread flaking methods in Europe was the Discoidal technique. However, technological analyses of these lithic artifacts are not yet sufficiently integrated into a corpus of zooarchaeological indicators that outline an ecological profile of Neanderthal mobility. To address this issue, this study presents evidence from Grotta di Fumane in northern Italy, where the exclusive use of the Discoid manufacturing technology is embedded in a Late Mousterian sequence with Levallois industries. The paper begins with a presentation of the regional ecological and contextual setting, and then explains the taphonomic and zooarchaeological data from the large and varied ungulate assemblage. Results show that hunting activity was shaped by the availability of game and that well-established, cost-effective patterns were used in carcass processing. Compared on a broader scale with other contexts where Discoid implements have been taken into account in relation to faunal assemblages, these foraging practices show that a common model for Neanderthal subsistence strategy cannot be applied.},

 abstract = {Biomolecules, in particular DNA, assist us in generating and testing hypotheses about human evolutionary history. Molecular analyses testing for and then utilizing a local molecular clock can inform us as to the timing of the split between different lineages or populations. When applied to the split between hominins and chimpanzees, for instance, the molecular clock estimates of their divergence date place constraints on interpretations of the growing fossil record from the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene. The pattern and distribution of modern human variation can be used to extrapolate back in time to infer when and where the modern human gene pool arose. Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome sequences and markers have been extensively surveyed in populations from around the world. Numerous nuclear loci and other markers, such as microsatellites and Alu insertions, have similarly been sampled and analyzed. More recently, high-throughput massively parallel sequencing technologies have allowed for the characterization of hundreds of human and nonhuman primate complete genomes. The majority of such analyses point toward a relatively recent origin for modern human diversity from a small population in Africa within the last 200 Ka, with a subsequent dispersal into Eurasia less than 100 Ka though there is some debate as to the timing of these events. While analyses of ancient mitochondrial sequences from archaic hominins strongly suggest that archaic females did not contribute to the modern human mitochondrial gene pool, whole-genome sequences of two archaic populations suggest limited interbreeding with modern humans in Eurasia but not Africa. Analyses of modern African genomes suggest that some populations also interbred with an as yet unknown archaic population or populations. Thus, while a complete replacement of archaic populations by African-derived modern humans is no longer fully tenable, only a limited amount interbreeding between anatomically modern human populations and archaic forebears is likely to have taken place.},

 abstract = {Research into animal bone density has provided the foundation for the assessment of post-depositional destruction of archaeological faunal assemblages. This paper presents bone mineral density values for caprid long bones as determined by computed tomography (CT). Unlike photon densitometry, the technique employed in previous archaeological studies of bone density, CT provides precise assessments of the cross-sectional area of scan sites. Researchers using photon densitometry have been unable to factor out the marrow cavity in their determination of cross-sectional area, thereby significantly underestimating the density of long bone shafts. The density values obtained by CT are much higher, particularly for middle shaft portions, than those presented in previous studies and are more consistent with existing data on the material properties of bone. For two archaeological faunal assemblages that have been subject to post-depositional attrition, the CT density values show a much stronger correlation with long bone portion survival than those provided by photon densitometry. Given such advantages over photon densitometry, CT is a promising method for future archaeological investigations into bone density.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, thick enamel has often been used to infer durophagy (i.e., hard nut and seed consumption) in extinct hominins. These inferences are based on the hypothesis that thick enamel is primarily an adaptation to prevent tooth fracture or chipping resulting from high-stress loads produced during the mastication of large hard foods. An alternative view argues that thick enamel may aid in maintaining tooth function in the face of gradual dental wear from grit, phytoliths and acid, which may be found in foods of widely varying hardness. We use estimates of primate dietary abrasiveness and recorded lifespan to test the hypothesis that enamel thickness is selectively responsive to lifetime dental wear resistance. We use data from the literature to relate enamel thickness to measures of dietary abrasiveness, diet profiles, and longevity for 17 primate species and performed linear regression using several combinations of these variables. We found a positive association between lifetime dietary wear and enamel thickness, suggesting that thick molar enamel in primates may have evolved as a means to resist wear apart from selection to resist tooth fracture. Assuming our estimates of lifetime dietary wear are accurate, we caution against ascribing thick enamel solely to the presence of hard-object feeding in paleoanthropological contexts without also considering primate lifespan and other aspects of feeding ecology.},

 abstract = {The fat‐ and nutrient‐rich marrow of animal bones can be extracted using different techniques. Passive hammerstone percussion has been the primary focus of experimental bone breaking and the main analogy to understand archaeological bone breakage. Here, the term ‘passive’ is applied because the bone to be broken passively receives the impact from a hammerstone. In addition to this technique, there is another bone‐breaking method that also requires direct percussion, but in an active way. This method is percussion by ‘batting’, in which the bone is actively hit against an anvil until the bone breaks. This technique has rarely been considered at an experimental level and, therefore, has been omitted in the majority of the archaeological interpretations of faunal assemblages with pre‐use of fire technologies. In this study, we attempt to analytically characterize this type of bone‐breaking technique through a systematic comparison with hammerstone percussion. The applied statistical tests will allow us to distinguish some diagnostic modifications, such as the outlines of the fracture planes and the type of notches or their location with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bone. These features and their proportions allow the consideration of the use of this technique in Pleistocene anthropogenic faunal assemblages.},

 abstract = {Attempts to discern bone modification by early hominids from that by carnivores are limited due, in part, to the fact that most inferential models are based on the singular actions of either hominids or carnivores. In order partly to rectify this situation, I conducted two types of two-stage, or dual-patterned, actualistic studies to simulate whole carcass processing by hominids (stage one) followed by carnivores (stage two) in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro ecosystems of Tanzania in 1990 and 1991. Thirty whole-bone to carnivore experiments, which model hominid defleshing, and 39 hammerstone to carnivore experiments, which model the removal of flesh, marrow, the brain, and the mandibular nerve by hominids, were conducted to model variability in the behaviour of early hominids and determine its effect on secondary bone modification by carnivores.Vultures, maribou storks, jackals, and spotted hyenas were observed modifying bones from experiments in both samples; however, the overwhelming majority of bone modification was conducted by spotted hyenas. In stage two, spotted hyenas (1) deleted between 90 and 100% of the axial and compact elements placed in both experimental samples; (2) deleted 79·7% of long-bone epiphyses produced by hammerstone breakage and 98·9% of epiphyses from intact long bones; (3) placed at least one tooth mark on 64·3 and 23·2% of all the specimens recovered from whole-bone to carnivore and hammerstone to carnivore experiments, respectively; and (4) added and subtracted specimens which altered the number of specimens bearing at least one cut mark, scrape mark, and/or percussion mark. These results all reflect the cumulative and variable actions of hominids (via simulation) and spotted hyenas. Therefore, it is not possible to delete traces produced by carnivores without removing data indicative of hominid behaviour as well.},

Acquisition of dry grassland adaptations such as thick enamel by 18 Ma, adducted hallux by 14 Ma, and cursorial legs by 1.8 Ma, alternated with woodland adaptations such as short stiff back by 16 Ma, erect stance by 6 Ma, and flat face by 3.5 Ma.

Using shotgun metagenomic data from wild baboons, we found that social group membership and social network relationships predicted both the taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome and the structure of genes encoded by gut microbial species. Rates of interaction directly explained variation in the gut microbiome, even after controlling for diet, kinship, and shared environments. They therefore strongly implicate direct physical contact among social partners in the transmission of gut microbial species. We identified 51 socially structured taxa, which were significantly enriched for anaerobic and non-spore-forming lifestyles. Our results argue that social interactions are an important determinant of gut microbiome composition in natural animal populations-a relationship with important ramifications for understanding how social relationships influence health, as well as the evolution of group living. },

 abstract = {ABSTRACT   In a recent paper, Stiner reviewed certain trends in the Middle Palaeolithic (MP) economy and social behaviour, including most notably galvanization of the prime‐age ungulate hunting niche, and the intensification of occupations in the form of domestic–residential camps. However, the emergence of these trends is blurred when we observe the European archaeological record before Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 7. Our aim in this paper is to test the validity of some key arguments related to subsistence and occupation to assess the Lower Palaeolithic roots of these MP trends, using the faunal record of the TD10.1 bone bed level (ca. 300 ka) at Gran Dolina (Atapuerca). The taphonomic results from this level indicate an assemblage composed almost exclusively of prime‐age ungulates. Anthropogenic marks are very abundant, reflecting a wide variety of domestic activities. Early primary access to the carcasses by hominins, indicated by the taxonomic and mortality patterns, suggests the procurement of animal carcasses by regular hunting. Red deer, accompanied in lower proportions by other prey species, reinforce the selective character of the hominin subsistence strategies at the Gran Dolina TD10.1 bone bed, expanding temporally and geographically our documentation of the MP hominin predatory niche. Taphonomy, together with other results from technology and archaeo‐stratigraphy, suggest that the bone bed accumulation reflects long‐term hominin use of the site as a residential base camp, suggesting deep roots for the observed MP subsistence and occupational patterns. },

From about 1915 such research was no longer common until the 1950s, when there was a return to ethnoarchaeological fieldwork that accelerated after the rise of the new archaeology in 1960. Today we can look back on major research projects that have revealed many general principles that have greatly aided our understanding of the past, ranging from formation processes of sites to use life of pottery and surface alterations that reveal pottery function, to disposal patterns of tools and faunal remains among hunter-forager peoples.

Manipulations of the Neanderthal data produce immature mortality distributions within the ranges of the Recent human samples, but they maintain the high prime-age adult and low older adult mortality. This high young adult mortality in the Neanderthal sample does not appear to be a product of differential preservation or recognition of fossil remains or the systematic underageing of older adults. However. it is likely to be the product of a combination of demographic stress (associated with high levels of stress indicators), the effects of pooling across temporally and geographically diverse and fluctuating Neanderthal populations, the need for full mobility among all individuals and hence a dearth of older individuals dying in shelters, and (possibly) differential disposal of older individuals in shelters. The first three factors support the interpretations of high levels of adaptive stress previously suggested by palaeopathological analyses of their remains.},

 abstract = {C.K. Brain documented two interesting patterns in the Pleistocene faunas of Swartkrans Cave, South Africa: (1) The earliest depositional units, Members 1 and 2, preserve high numbers of hominid fossils, while the numbers drop sharply in the more recent Member 3. (2) Burned bone specimens, which seem to have been altered in fires tended by hominids, appear for the first time in Member 3. It was suggested that mastery of fire provided a “shift in the balance of power”, allowing hominids to carry out activities in the cave for the first time unmolested by predators. A lack of butchered bones in Members 1 and 2 and their presence in Member 3 provided support for the hypothesis. However, we have now identified butchered bones in all three units. Further, our findings reveal a lack of variability in butchery patterns through time at Swartkrans; in all cases hominids appear to have been proficient carcass foragers. The real “shift” at Swartkrans does not appear to be one of eventual hominid dominance over carnivores, but rather one of a predominance of leopards at Swartkrans in Member 1 times to the alternating presence of leopards and hyenas in Members 2 and 3. Consistent leopard presence in Member 1 seems to have discouraged hominid activity in the vicinity of the cave. In contrast, by the time Members 2 and 3 were forming hominids may have temporarily used the cave, taking advantage of those periods of carnivore absence.},

 abstract = {Analyses and interpretations of the human behavioral significance of frequencies of cut-marked mammal bones have been ongoing for at least 50 years. Many of these studies focus on determining the so-called “butchering pattern.” Few analysts comment on the tremendous range of variation in frequencies and anatomical distributions of cut marks across multiple assemblages of remains of a taxon. Such variation is evident even when faunal remains are associated with technologically, temporally, and environmentally similar cultures. This kind of variation is illustrated with frequencies of cut marked bone specimens comprising major limb joints of two artiodactyl genera from two sites in the northwestern United States. Three hypotheses are tested. The first and second hypotheses (one per genus) predict that the frequencies of cut-marked remains of a taxon from one site will match those frequencies evident on the remains of the same taxon at the other site. Both hypotheses are falsified. The third hypothesis is that remains of the larger taxon at each site will display more cut marks than the remains of the smaller taxon at each site. This hypothesis is statistically falsified at one site but not the other. Refutation of the hypotheses suggests that well-founded interpretations of frequencies of cut-marked remains may require unique kinds of contextual data.},

Along the Cantabrian coast (northern Spain) the shift from the specialised procurement of high-ranked prey to more diversified resource exploitation during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition has traditionally been explained from two contrasting points of view. On the one hand, the demographic theory proposes the progressive growth of human population and its energetic requirements as the determining factor. On the other hand, the environmental theory argues that climatic amelioration and resulting reforestation were the primary cause. To study this phenomenon in detail a mathematical model has been created to simultaneously simulate ungulate population dynamics and their environmental and demographic stochasticity, the effects of topography on resource allocation, and human foraging behaviour in terms of prey choice.

 abstract = {Abstract
                  Late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions in North America have been attributed to a number of factors or combination of factors, primarily climate change and human hunting, but the relative roles of these factors remain much debated. Clo-vis-period hunters exploited species such as mammoth, but many now extinct species such as camels were seemingly not hunted. Archaeological evidence from the Wally’s Beach site in southern Canada, including stone tools and butchered bone, provide the first evidence that Clovis people hunted North American camels. Archaeologists generally dismiss human hunting as a significant contributor to Pleistocene extinctions in North America, but Wally’s Beach demonstrates that human hunting was more inclusive than assumed and we must continue to consider hunting as a factor in Pleistocene extinctions.
Las extinciones de grandes mamíferos del Pleistoceno Tarde en América del Norte se han atribuido a una serie de factores o la combinación de factores, principalmente el cambio climático y la caza hecha por los seres humanos, pero la importancia relativa de estos factores siguen siendo muy debatido. Cazadores del período Clovis explotaron especies como mamut, pero muchas especies ahora extintas como los camellos no fueron aparentemente cazados. La evidencia arqueológica en el sitio de Wally’s Beach en el sur de Canadá, incluidas las herramientas de piedra y huesos modificados por seres humanos, proporcionan la primera evidencia de que la gente de Clovis cazaba camellos en América del Norte. Arqueólogos generalmente desestiman la caza como un contribuyente significativo a la extinción del Pleistoceno en América del Norte, pero Wally’s Beach demuestra que la caza por seres humanos estaba más extendida de lo previsto, y debemos seguir examinando la caza como un factor en la extinción del Pleistoceno.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of conventions (Young Econometrica 61(1):57–84, 1993) in n-player hawk-dove games where multiple players share the same payoff-irrelevant label, such as “blue” or “green”. With more than two players, the stochastically stable equilibrium depends on how many players in the contest share each label. If the cost of fighting is high, then the long-run equilibrium is favorable to the label shared by fewer players – those players play hawk – while if the cost is low, then the opposite convention develops. This result provides one explanation for the emergence of informal property rights. In disputes over property, a fundamental distinction exists between the possessor, who is unique, and non-possessors, who can be several. For objects whose value is low relative to the cost of conflict over them, this asymmetry favors the development of informal property rights conventions.},

A unique macrobotanical assemblage of 55 food plant taxa from the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel includes seeds, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and plants producing underground storage organs. The food plant remains were part of a diet that also included aquatic and terrestrial fauna. This diverse assemblage, 780,000 y old, reflects a varied plant diet, staple plant foods, environmental knowledge, seasonality, and the use of fire in food processing. It provides insight into the wide spectrum of the diet of mid-Pleistocene hominins, enhancing our understanding of their adaptation from the perspective of subsistence. Our results shed light on hominin abilities to adjust to new environments, facilitating population diffusion and colonization beyond Africa. We reconstruct the major vegetal foodstuffs, while considering the possibility of some detoxification by fire. The site, located in the Levantine Corridor through which several hominin waves dispersed out of Africa, provides a unique opportunity to study mid-Pleistocene vegetal diet and is crucial for understanding subsistence aspects of hominin dispersal and the transition from an African-based to a Eurasian diet.},

This theory provides an alternative to, and replacement for, current explanations, including diet breadth models of optimal foraging theory, that are based on an outmoded concept of asymmetrical adaptation and that attempt to explain domestication as an adaptive response to resource imbalance resulting from either environmental decline or human population growth. The small-scale human societies that first domesticated plants and animals share a number of basic interrelated attributes that when considered as an integrated and coherent set of behaviors provide the context for explaining initial domestication not as an adaptive response to an adverse environmental shift or to human population growth or packing but rather as the result of deliberate human enhancement of resource-rich environments in situations where evidence of resource imbalance is absent.},

 abstract = {Recent work in comparative linguistics suggests that all, or almost all, attested human languages may derive from a single earlier language. If that is so, then this language-like nearly all extant languages-most likely had a basic ordering of the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) in a declarative sentence of the type "the man (S) killed (V) the bear (O)." When one compares the distribution of the existing structural types with the putative phylogenetic tree of human languages, four conclusions may be drawn. (i) The word order in the ancestral language was SOV. (ii) Except for cases of diffusion, the direction of syntactic change, when it occurs, has been for the most part SOV > SVO and, beyond that, SVO > VSO/VOS with a subsequent reversion to SVO occurring occasionally. Reversion to SOV occurs only through diffusion. (iii) Diffusion, although important, is not the dominant process in the evolution of word order. (iv) The two extremely rare word orders (OVS and OSV) derive directly from SOV.},

 abstract = { Few archaeological sites in the Americas contain high concentrations of human burials dating back to the early Holocene. The tropical karstic region of Lagoa Santa, in central Brazil (state of Minas Gerais) is one of the richest bioanthropological records available to study the behaviors and funerary practices of early Holocene South Americans, with more than 200 skeletons found so far. One of the key locations to examine the history of human settlement in Lagoa Santa is the site of Lapa do Santo, a rockshelter known to contain the oldest rock art and the earliest evidence of funerary complexity in the continent. In this geoarchaeological investigation we focus on the early Holocene settlement at Lapa do Santo (7.9–12.7 cal kyBP) applying high-resolution geoarchaeological techniques, such as micromorphology, organic petrology and μFTIR, on both archaeological, modern reference and experimental samples. This is the first time that a micro-contextual approach integrated with experimental geoarchaeology has been applied to study the formation of rockshelter deposits in a tropical setting. Our results show that the stratigraphic sequence formed under the dual influence of anthropogenic sedimentation—through continuous combustion activities—and geogenic sedimentation in the form of oxisol aggregates which fell from above the limestone cliff into the rockshelter. Intact hearths and remobilized combustion debris, possibly hearth rake-out, are close to the graves suggesting repeated burning activities as part of the ritual behavior of early Holocene South Americans. Large amounts of ash are intermixed with heated and unheated oxisol aggregates. Heated termite mound fragments were also found mixed within the sediments. Post-depositional alteration of the site includes limited bioturbation and localized, low energy surface water and sub-surface concentrations of moisture, leading to precipitation of dense, secondary carbonates. The age inversions can be attributed to the human action of reworking the ashy sediments and not to post-abandonment processes. Despite this, the overall preservation of the sediments is good and most human burials can be considered to be in primary context.},

 abstract = {This study provides a taphonomic analysis of the largest known sample of bone fragments collected from chimpanzee hunts. The entire sample consists of 455 bone fragments from 57 chimpanzee hunting episodes of 65 prey individuals at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. It has low taxonomic diversity, consisting overwhelmingly of primates, especially red colobus monkeys. The age distribution of the prey remains is skewed towards pre-adults. Cranial bones are the dominant element, followed by long bones. Axial postcranial elements have low survivorship, with a complete absence of pre-caudal vertebrae. Bone is damaged in distinct ways, such as: destruction of long bone ends, typically with intact but chewed shafts; fragmentation and compression cracking of crania; and preservation of only the iliac blades of the innominates. Tooth marks are present but uncommon (4.4% of total NISP). These analyses enable us to: 1) describe and characterize consistent patterns of bone damage inflicted by chimpanzees across a much larger prey sample than has been previously studied; 2) make a preliminary comparison of the generalized chimpanzee taphonomic signature to that of leopard and eagle consumption of primates, as well as modern human consumption of small mammals; and 3) assess the utility of such samples for recognition of early hominin small mammal carnivory. We present a model that may be useful for detecting a pre-technological hominin carnivory and suggest some fossil locales at which close inspection of cercopithecoid remains for the above patterns might reveal traces of hominin hunting, though we caution that a pre-technological hominin hunted "assemblage" is not likely to be archaeologically visible.},

 abstract = {The dense concentrations of faunal remains and stone tools at some Plio-Pleistocene sites at Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) and Koobi Fora (Kenya) have traditionally been interpreted as favored locations to which hominids repeatedly transported carcass parts for processing (Leakey, 1971; Isaac, 1978, 1983, 1984; Bunn, 1982, 1991; Potts, 1982, 1988; Bunn and Kroll, 1986; Schick, 1987; Blumenschine, 1988, 1991, 1995; Bunn and Ezzo, 1993; Schick and Toth, 1993; Oliver, 1994; Rose and Marshall, 1996; O’Connell, 1997). These co-occurrences, which typically contain bones from several individuals within a vertically discrete horizon (referred to by Isaac [1978] as “Type C” sites), often preserve high densities of archaeological material in spatially restricted concentrations. For many researchers, these archaeological sites represent places where hominids may have stayed for extended periods, very likely performing activities beyond stone tool manufacture and carcass manipulation (Leakey, 1971; Isaac, 1978, 1984; Bunn, 1982; Stanley, 1992; Domínguez-Rodrigo, 1994a; Oliver, 1994). The seemingly frequent processing of nutrient-dense large mammal tissue by hominids between 2 and 1.5 Ma led many evolutionary anthropologists to suggest meat eating as the critical adaptation for understanding the emergence of stone tool use. These debates necessarily gravitated towards the evidence from Olduvai, and more specifically, from the single site of FLK Level 22 (the Zinjanthropus Floor). Despite its importance for reconstructing hominid behavior, an almost exclusive focus on the archaeological evidence from FLK Zinj has limited archaeologists’ views in two important ways. First, it forced researchers to neglect regional variability in hominid adaptive patterns (clearly stressed by Potts [1994]). Second, it hindered the development of explanatory frameworks that could deal with a diversity of site formation scenarios. Although the debates over these “Type C” sites have clearly generated fruitful discussions over the past two decades, it is also evident that other types of archaeological occurrences representing stone tool–using activities, not necessarily linked to carcass manipulation, have yet to be fully appreciated.},

 abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous functional disorder with a multifactorial etiology that involves the interplay of both host and environmental factors. Among environmental factors relevant for IBS etiology, the diet stands out given that the majority of IBS patients report their symptoms to be triggered by meals or specific foods. The diet provides substrates for microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data, we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms. Finally, this review provides recommendations for future studies that would enable elucidation of the role of diet and microbiota and how these factors may be (inter)related in the pathophysiology of IBS. },

Data indicate that, far from being a passive half of the relationship, insects in general, and stinging Hymenoptera in particular, are active participants that have greatly influenced the relationship. Predators have been a strong component of the selection pressure in the evolution of painful and toxic bee, wasp, and ant stings and these insects, in turn, have influenced hunting behavior and learning in at least higher primates. The special example of honey bees and humans is highlighted. Both humans and the bees have benefitted from a relationship that represents an unprecedented example of a predator-prey interaction evolving recently into facultative mutualism.},

It doubles the sample of sites where comparison of long limb bone element quantification is made by using alternative identification techniques based on epiphyses and epiphyses plus shafts. A refined method of long limb element quantification using shafts is discussed and applied to four sites representing different time periods from the end of the Middle Pleistocene to the end of the Upper Pleistocene. It is shown that when long limb elements are properly quantified a hypothesis of early access to carcasses at these sites can be supported. The data thus drawn are also used to compare skeletal part evenness across the time periods represented by the four sites selected. The results indicate low‐cost transport decisions by hominids at these sites. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {In many animal species, widowed or divorced parents may remate before young of the prior union are independent. In such circumstances, stepparents may kill their predecessors' offspring, may tolerate them without providing care, or may invest in them more or less as genetic parents do. Rohwer proposed that all three of these responses may be understood as mating tactics, adapted to different social and ecological circumstances. We discuss the selection pressures that would favor each of these alternatives and review relevant evidence on nonhuman stepparenting, especially in birds. Stepparental tolerance and (partial or full) care, which are the predominant human responses, are common in nonhuman animals too, and in many cases there is evidence supporting their interpretation as stepparental mating effort adaptations. In general, however, this interpretation is not as well established for tolerance and care as it is for stepparental infanticide. Because tolerance and care are not distinct modes of behavior peculiar to stepparents, the hypothesis that they are nonadaptive by-products of parental psychology often remains tenable. We discuss the kinds of evidence needed to choose between by-product and stepparental adaptation hypotheses.},

 abstract = {Animal manure comprises an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but the variation in ARGs during anaerobic digestion at various temperatures and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Thus, we performed anaerobic digestion using dairy manure at three temperature levels (moderate: 20 °C, mesophilic: 35 °C and thermophilic: 55 °C), to analyze the dynamics of ARGs and bacterial communities by quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that 8/10 detected ARGs declined and 5/10 decreased more than 1.0 log during thermophilic digestion, whereas only four and five ARGs decreased during moderate and mesophilic digestion, respectively. The changes in ARGs and bacterial communities were similar under the moderate and mesophilic treatments, but distinct from those in the thermophilic system. Potential pathogens such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Corynebacterium were removed by thermophilic digestion but not by moderate and mesophilic digestion. The bacterial community succession was the dominant mechanism that influenced the variation in ARGs and integrons during anaerobic digestion. Thermophilic digestion decreased the amount of mesophilic bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) carrying ARGs. Anaerobic digestion generally decreased the abundance of integrons by eliminating the aerobic hosts of integrons (Actinomycetales and Bacilli). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion is recommended for the treatment and reuse of animal manure.},

We concluded that, of the 76 sites we assessed, 14 provided compelling evidence for human involvement in the death and/or dismemberment of such mammals. Of these sites, 12 involved mammoth (Mammuthus), the remaining two mastodon (Mammut). Here, we update that assessment. We examine Clovis-era, and earlier, sites reported since 2002, as well as sites examined previously but for which additional information has become available. Our assessment leads us to exclude Hebior (Wisconsin) from the list of accepted sites, and to add El Fin del Mundo (Sonora) and Wally's Beach (Alberta). There are now 15 sites on our list, providing what we find to be compelling evidence for human involvement in the death and/or dismemberment of five genera of now-extinct late Pleistocene mammals: Equus, Camelops, Cuvieronius, Mammut, and Mammuthus. As in 2002, however, we note this is a small fraction of the 37 genera that disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene, and for this and other reasons we remain highly skeptical that human overkill was responsible for their extinction.},

 abstract = {In a series of publications beginning in the 1960s, Neel and colleagues suggested that genetically nonrandom, or "lineal", population fissions contributed to genetic structure in ancient human groups. The authors reached this conclusion by studying the genetic consequences of village fissions among the Yanomamo, a Native South American group thought to have been relatively unaffected by European contact and, therefore, representative of the human past. On the basis of ethnographic accounts and pedigree data, they further concluded that patrilineal relationships were particularly important in shaping the genetic structure of villages following fissions. This study reexamines the genetic consequences of village fissions using autosomal STRs, Y-chromosome STRs, and mitochondrial DNA sequences collected from large samples of individuals from multiple Yanomamo villages. Our analyses of the autosomal STRs replicate the previous finding that village fissions have produced substantial genetic structure among the Yanomamo. However, our analyses of Y-chromosome STRs and mtDNA d-loop polymorphisms suggest that other population processes, including village movements, inter-village migration, and polygynous marriage, affect genetic structure in ways not predicted by a simple model of patrilineal fissions. We discuss the broader implications of population fissions for human evolution and the suitability of using the Yanomamo as a model for the human past.},

It evaluates the model from the perspective of an integrated archaeological framework that combines ‘tool-complex analysis’ with available faunal and floral data from selected early to mid-Holocene sites that span the transition. Tool-complex analysis is an empirical study that is based on the (possible) connection between the types of tools used and the economies of prehistoric societies. The evaluation process concludes that a modified non-lineal version of the availability model might more accurately describe the transition process in this region, and a ‘three trends model’ is offered as a potential alternative.},

 abstract = {The paper is a re-analysis of carcass transport data reported by two research groups (Bunn, Bartram & Kroll; O’Connell, Hawkes & Blurton Jones) monitoring the foraging activities of Hadza hunter–gatherers (northern Tanzania). The two teams offer different conclusions about the patterning, explanation and archaeological implications of Hadza field processing and transport decisions, yet the overall similarity between their data sets suggests that the conflicting conclusions have more to do with interpretive differences than with inherently different samples. At issue is whether or not the Hadza provide support for a concept known as the ‘‘schlepp effect’’, which has been used to identify transported bone assemblages in the early archaeological record on the basis of high limb bone representation relative to axial parts. The re-analysis mostly contradicts the ‘‘high limb schlepp effect’’ (my term), and three main aspects of Hadza carcass transport are noteworthy. First, animals up to zebra size (i.e.c. 750lb) are frequently transported completely and, even when some bones are discarded, the edible tissues associated with them are almost always consumed and/or transported. This is possible because the Hadza are able to spend relatively unlimited amounts of time at kill/butchery locations (i.e. predation risk is insignificant), which allows for extensive processing, food consumption and the summoning of many carcass carriers. Second, except for ribs, post-cranial axials (not limbs) are the most frequently transported elements. Finally, ribs and limb bones are often discarded at kill/butchery locations and their associated edible tissues are either eaten on the spot or transported to camps. In short, the Hadza try to transport as much food as possible, while reducing transport weight by discarding easily processed elements such as ribs and long bones.Interestingly, one cannot simply reflect these results back in time and expect that transported bone assemblages in the early archaeological record will also be dominated by post-cranial axials, with fewer long bones, and so on. This is because significant biological and ecological differences may exist between the modern Hadza and Early Pleistocene hominids. Foremost among these differences is predation risk from large carnivores at fresh carcasses, which would significantly alter the interplay between processing costs, transport costs and food benefit of ungulate carcasses. Modelling of these variables shows that increased predation risk limits time available at kill/butchery locations, which in turn limits the amount of meat-stripping, bone discard, food consumption and the number of available carriers. Under these conditions, early hominid foragers would be expected to discard or transport bones and associated edible tissues together, and two broadly different transport strategies—a weight-minimizing and a food-maximizing strategy—are theoretically possible based on the number of carcass carriers, carcass size and distance of transport. A weight-minimizing strategy closely resembles the ‘‘high limb schlepp effect’’, in fact, but the important point is that a ‘‘one size fits all’’ model for recognizing a transported bone assemblage is simply not realistic given the number of inter-related variables. The Hadza study also suggests that skeletal part data from large bone assemblages reflect diverse foraging returns, rather than a unimodal pattern of hominid carcass exploitation. Accordingly, archaeologists should be more cautious about reconstructing ‘‘typical’’ patterns of hominid carnivory and carcass transport from dense bone accumulations. Finally, some methodological suggestions are offered to enhance the explanatory power of skeletal part data by integrating them with surface modification data.},

The bones were then presented to four groups of mixed sex and mixed age chimpanzees from the Tulsa Zoo (Oklahoma) and the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (San Antonio, Texas). In the process of feeding on the coated bones, the chimpanzees inflicted discernible mastication damage on 73·61% of the total recovered bone specimens. Analysis of these chimpanzee-induced bone modifications reveals that non-technological hominoids of the same approximate size and with comparable dentition and bite force to the gracile australopithecines and earliestHomoare very capable of inflicting the same range and degree of damage to bones as are feeding carnivores. This finding implies that zooarchaeologists must take a contextual (configurational) approach when analysing mastication damage on arch-aeological bones, rather than automatically attributing all such damage to carnivores.},

Results indicate an unconstrained transport strategy in all levels and all size-weight categories. However, we also found differences in the skeletal distribution of medium-sized and large animals, which may be due to different transport strategies. These characteristics suggest that the superposition of transport and occupation events could be responsible for our results. In addition, we applied the same analysis to Hadza assemblages, which revealed similar results to those found at Abric Romaní. The most striking feature of the Hadza assemblages examined is the superposition of transport events as a result of successive occupation/deposition events. This suggests that the transport strategies used by Neanderthals at Abric Romaní are also characterized by a high degree of diversity in transport decisions.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Drawing on Williams’ distinction between thin and thick ethical concepts, I argue that current moral neuroscience and psychology unwarrantedly restrict their researches to thin morality only. Experiments typically investigate subjects’ judgments about rightness, appropriateness, or permissibility, that is, thin concepts. The nature and workings of thick concepts – e.g. , dignity, integrity, humanness, cruelty, pettiness, exploitation, or fanaticism – have not been empirically investigated; hence, they are absent from recent theories about morality. This may seem like a minor oversight, which some additional research can redress. I argue that the fix is not that simple: thick concepts challenge one of the theoretical backbones of much moral psychology and neuroscience; they challenge the conception of a hardwired and universal moral capacity in a way that thin concepts do not. In the conclusion I argue that the burgeoning science of morality should include both thin and thick, and that it should include the contributions of psychologists and neuroscientists as well as those of anthropologists, historians, and sociologists. 
Résumé Reprenant la distinction de Williams entre concepts éthiques profonds et superficiels, l'auteur affirme que les neurosciences et la psychologie actuelle n'atteignent que la moralité superficielle. De fait les expériences traitent de jugements des sujets sur le juste, l'opportun et le permis, tous concepts superficiels. La nature et le façonnage des concepts profonds : dignité, intégrité, humanité, cruauté, mesquinerie, exploitation, fanatisme sont complètements absents des théories récentes de la moralité. Ce n'est pas un oubli mineur aisément réparable car les concepts profonds mettent à mal, bien plus que ne peuvent le faire les concepts superficiels, un pilier de la recherche expérimentale actuelle à savoir la croyance en une capacité morale câblée de façon universelle. Il est temps de faire appel aux psychologues et auxneuroscientifiques, autant qu'aux anthropologues, historiens et sociologues.
Zusammenfassung Ausgehend von Williams Unterscheidung zwischen tiefgründigen und oberflächlichen ethischen Konzepten, behauptet der Autor, dass die Neurowissenschaften und die heutige Psychologie nur eine oberflächliche Moralität erreichen. In der Tat, die Erfahrungen handeln von Urteilen über das Richtige, das Opportune und das Erlaubte, alles oberflächliche Konzepte. Eigenart und Ausformung von tiefgründigen Konzepten (Würde, Unbestechlichkeit, Menschlichkeit, Gewalt, Neid, Ausnutzung, Fanatismus) fehlen gänzlich in aktuellen Moraltheorien. Wer dies übersieht, vergisst, dass die tiefgründigen Konzepte, weitaus mehr als die oberflächlichen, einen Grundpfeiler der heutigen experimentellen Forschung, nämlich den Glauben an eine universelle Moralfähigkeit, erschüttern. Beide Konzepte, profunde wie oberflächliche, müssen berücksichtigt und Beiträge von Psychologen, Neurowissenschaftlern sowie Anthropologen, Historikern und Soziologen hinzugezogen werden.},

 abstract = {Soils are known to be products of environmental factors such as climate, vegetation, topographic setting, parent material, and time for formation, so that paleosols, or fossil soils, can potentially reveal changing environments of the past. Evidence from paleosols for past climate and vegetation in East Africa does not support traditional narratives of human evolution during a single transition from primeval forest to dry climate and open grassland. Instead, paleosols indicate climatic oscillations between wet and dry, and alternating expansion of woodland and grassland, since at least 18 Ma (million years ago). Acquisition of dry grassland adaptations such as thick enamel by 18 Ma, adducted hallux by 14 Ma, and cursorial legs by 1.8 Ma, alternated with woodland adaptations such as short stiff back by 16 Ma, erect stance by 6 Ma, and flat face by 3.5 Ma. Our ancestors survived profoundly changing climate and vegetation, with some adaptations lasting only to the next environmental shift, but others proving to be of lasting value.},

 abstract = {In many parts of Africa, people in the rural area use some kinds of weed and protect them in their cultivation fields. In this paper, I show the relationship between the Sandawe who live in the semi-arid area in Tanzania and false sesame (Ceratotheca sesamoides), a weed in their cultivation fields. I will especially focus on the usage of the weed as diet, and its preservation and sharing. The results are as follows; 1) the Sandawe assign great value to false sesame and tend it in their fields. 2) They gather false sesame in the rainy season both from one's own field and also from fields owned by other people as per their own custom practice. 3) They use the fresh leaves in the rainy season and dry the rest for usage in the dry season. 4) During the dry season, the dry leaves are shared among households. The sharing is quite fluid where it can be free, barter for other things or sold depending on social relationship between people involved but also based on individual assessment of the ones in need of goods. The foregoing sharing is only for some plants like false sesame, which are neither the crops nor the wild plants. In this regard, I argue that their usage of false sesame is a base for the ecology of false sesame and sharing them.},

 abstract = {This paper describes analysis of bone counts by maximum likelihood (abcml), a new statistical method for analysis of bone counts from archæological sites. It estimates (i) the proportion of the animals in an assemblage contributed by each of several agents of deposition, (ii) the damage from such causes as gnawing by carnivores, and (iii) the number of animals represented in the assemblage. In addition to point estimates, the method provides confidence intervals and measures the goodness of fit of the model to the data. Abcml is evaluated using simulated skeletal part counts and the Hadza pattern of transport. These experiments show that the method yields accurate estimates even with severely damaged assemblages. In contrast to the minimum number of individuals (MNI), which is shown to yield severely biased estimates of the number of individuals in a data set, abcml estimates all its parameters with minimal bias. It is used to consider the hypothesis that the faunal assemblages of Gatecliff and Last Supper caves were deposited by people who transported animal parts in the manner of modern Hadza. Under that hypothesis, the data indicate that both sites are kill–butchery sites rather than home bases. The residuals from this analysis, however, are much larger than they should be. This observation makes it possible to reject the hypothesis that these sites were accumulated by people who behaved in accord with the Hadza small-animal transport model.},

 abstract = {Humans diverge from most mammals, including nonhuman primates, by depositing significant quantities of body fat in utero and are consequently one of the fattest species on record at birth. While explanations for the fat layer of human neonates have commonly assumed that it serves as insulation to compensate for hairlessness, empirical support for this hypothesis is presently weak. Whether the tissue's abundance at birth and growth changes in adiposity during infancy and childhood might be explained in light of its role as energy buffer has not been assessed, and this possibility is explored through development of a model of fat function and growth centered on two related hypotheses. The first is that the greater adiposity of human neonates is at least partially explainable as an accompaniment of the enlarged human brain, which demands a larger energy reserve to ensure that its obligatory needs are met when the flow of resources from mother or other caretakers is disrupted. The second is that age-related changes in the likelihood of experiencing such disruption have influenced the pattern of investment in the tissue, reflected today in peak adiposity during infancy and a decline to a leaner childhood period. Nutritional disruption is common at birth and until lactation is established, during which time human newborns survive from fats deposited prenatally, suggesting one possible explanation for the early onset of fat deposition. At weaning, the transition from breast milk to supplemental foods and the parallel transition from maternal to endogenous immune protection interact to increase the frequency and impact of nutritional disruption, and this may help explain why newborns devote roughly 70% of growth expenditure to fat deposition during the early postnatal months. Evidence is presented that fat stores are mobilized during infections, hinting at one possible mechanism underlying the association between nutritional status and infectious morbidity and mortality among infants in nutritionally stressed human populations. Consistent with the proposed hypothesis, well-fed infants acquire peak fat reserves by an age of peak prevalence of malnutrition, infectious disease, and fat reserve depletion in less-buffered contexts, and childhood--characterized by minimal investment in the tissue--is a stage of reduced risk of energy stress. The model presented here foregrounds energy storage in adipose tissue as an important life-history strategy and a means to modify mortality risk during the nutritionally turbulent period of infancy.},

The concept of ''community'' is, itself, deemed unproblematic, and often is used in either a reductivist or ethnocentric manner. An exploration of nonindustrial foraging societies is used to illustrate the wide variation in types and definitions of communities that exists. Social groups in foraging societies exhibit characteristics similar to those observed in technologically mediated social groups, and these similarities illustrate the deficiencies of typological or ideal-type definitions of ''community,'' as well as the artificial nature of a division between ''real'' and ''electronic'' communities. Groups that depend on computer-mediated communication among members can, and should, be examined using the same social science concepts and methods used to examine any other social groups.},

The emergence of complex adaptations among hunter–gatherers by the close of the Pleistocene is widely assumed. Those hunter–gatherers who occupied the classic region of southwestern Europe during the Upper Paleolithic are one of the most heralded examples. During the course of the Upper Paleolithic, social evolution has taken the path of ever-increasing elaboration and complexity. Most Paleolithic archeologists will readily admit that the standard measures of complexity (for example, increasing definition of space or territory) are still outside the scope of Upper Paleolithic archaeological resolution. This is just as much the case for those ecological, environmental, settlement, and subsistence variables that are usually considered more accessible to archeologists as it is for those considered less accessible such as hierarchic organization or information networks.},

In the domestic state, the proportion of polyunsaturated to non essential fatty acids was of the order of 1/50, whereas in the free-living animal it was 1/2.3. There also seemed to be a greater diversity of polyunsaturated acids in free-living species. These differences may arise partly because oil-rich vegetation which is available to free-living animals has been eliminated from the diet of domestic animals raised on grassland. Since man's tissue lipids approximate to the domestic pattern on which he is dependent, the question arises as to whether the total domestic development of water-rich vegetation is nutritionally detrimental and that a resultant low balance of polyunsaturated to saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids may be related to arterial disease.},

The new method shows that bone damage patterns differ according to carcass type and size. They also differ depending on environmental conditions (captive and wild carnivores). The method is also useful to detect the type of carnivores involved in the modification of epiphyseal portions. This opens the door to interpretations of hominin–carnivore interactions and the resulting strategies of carcass acquisition strategies by hominins. The application of the method to a sample of epiphyseal portions from two archaeological sites from Olduvai Gorge (BK and FLK N) shows its potential resolution. BK has been previously interpreted as a hominin–carnivore assemblage, whereas FLK N has been interpreted as a felid-accumulated assemblage. The new method confirms these interpretations.},

 abstract = {Although human foraging behavior, i.e., the method used to get food procurement from the wild, is the economic criterion usually used in the academic literature in order to define hunter-gatherer societies, it is restricted neither to these societies nor to this goal. It consists of the extraction of natural resources by means of various techniques, such as hunting, fishing and gathering. It is applied to a broad range of wild resources – aquatic and terrestrial, plants, animals and minerals – even though in some cases it could be limited only to some of these resources such as the non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that while foraging is an ubiquitous human behavior, its goals are evolving with the passage of time. More precisely these goals that exist today have been present in some form in the past, only their importance and emphasis has changed over time and with the historical, sociological and ecological contexts. While subsistence seems naturally the most obvious motivation of human foraging behavior, the latter also occurs in various contexts such as in mixed economies. Moreover, other goals – different from the biological one – also exist. Indeed, foraging can be a mean to obtain a – primary or secondary – source of income provided through trade of harvested wild products. Socio-cultural goals may also motivate human foraging behavior. They are related to culture and heritage, recreational values, or to environmental conservation and sustainability, the latter being exemplified for instance by the recent movement of urban foragers.},

 abstract = {Au cours de l'évolution des espèces, la disponibilité des aliments a constitué une formidable pression de sélection. Chez les primates et chez l'homme, la recherche d'une nourriture à haute valeur énergétique a conditionné le comportement alimentaire et l'activité sociale. La sélection naturelle a favorisé la prolifération des individus ayant les capacités cérébrales les mieux adaptées à leur environnement. L'alimentation de l'homme a notablement varié au cours des millénaires, notamment après l'avènement de l'agriculture il y a environ 8000 ans et après la révolution industrielle du siècle dernier. Or, l'homme moderne possède, à peu de choses près, le même patrimoine génétique et les mêmes fonctions métaboliques que son ancêtre direct du paléolithique supérieur. L'inadéquation entre l'alimentation de l'homme actuel et ses possibilités physiologiques pourrait bien expliquer certaines pathologies dites de «surcharges » et un certain nombre d'affections du tube digestif. À la lumière de ces données, on pourrait proposer des régimes alimentaires plus conformes à nos besoins et à nos possibilités physiologiques ainsi qu'aux particularités génétiques individuelles ou ethniques.AbstractDuring evolution, food availability widely contributed to natural selection. In primates and in human beeings, the need for high-energy food influenced the alimentary behavior and social activity. Natural selection favored the species with optimal cerebral capacities for surviving according to the environmental conditions. Human feeding has widely varied during the last millenniums, namely after the development of agiculture 8000 years ago and the recent industrial revolution. During evolution, food availability strongly influenced genotype and phenotype. The human genetic endowment has changed relatively slightly since the appearance of modern human being during the late paleolithic. The inadequation between the nutrition of the modern human beeing and his physiological capacities could explain a number of metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases. These data suggest that diets more conform to our capacities or to individual and genetic variations should be proposed.},

As a critical first step, bacterial diversity and composition was studied in 30 latrines in Tanzania and Vietnam using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and correlated with a number of intrinsic environmental factors such as pH, temperature, organic matter content/composition and geographical factors. Clear differences were observed at the operational taxonomic unit, family and phylum level in terms of richness and community composition between latrines in Tanzania and Vietnam. The results also clearly show that environmental variables, particularly substrate type and availability, can exert a strong structuring influence on bacterial communities in latrines from both countries. The origins and significance of these environmental differences are discussed. This work describes the bacterial ecology of pit latrines in combination with inherent latrine characteristics at an unprecedented level of detail. As such, it provides useful baseline information for future studies that aim to understand the factors that affect decomposition rates in pit latrines. },

 abstract = {This volume deals with the pressing issue of uncertainty in archaeological modeling. Detecting where and when uncertainty is introduced to the modeling process is critical, as are strategies for minimizing, reconciling, or accommodating such uncertainty. Included chapters provide unique perspectives on uncertainty in archaeological modeling, ranging in both theoretical and methodological orientation. The strengths and weaknesses of various identification and mitigation techniques are discussed, in particular sensitivity analysis. The chapters demonstrate that for archaeological modeling purposes, there is no quick fix for uncertainty; indeed, each archaeological model requires intensive consideration of uncertainty and specific applications for calibration and validation. As very few such techniques have been problematized in a systematic manner or published in the archaeological literature, this volume aims to provide guidance and direction to other modelers in the field by distilling some basic principles for model testing derived from insight gathered in the case studies presented. Additionally, model applications and their attendant uncertainties are presented from distinct spatio-temporal contexts and will appeal to a broad range of archaeological modelers. This volume will also be of interest to non-modeling archaeologists, as consideration of uncertainty when interpreting the archaeological record is also a vital concern for the development of non-formal (or implicit) models of human behavior in the past.},

 abstract = {We report here definitive evidence of butchery, most probably associated with hunting, of giant extinct lemurs by early human settlers in Madagascar. Specimens of Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur insignis from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and Tsirave, show classic signs of butchering. We compared these to the bones (also from Taolambiby) of butchered Propithecus verreauxi, a lemur still living in the region. The characteristics of the tool-induced extinct-lemur bone alterations (sharp cuts and chop marks near joints, oblique cuts along the shafts, spiral fractures, and percussion striae) suggest skinning, disarticulation, and filleting. Conclusive evidence of megafaunal modification by humans in Madagascar was limited previously to a few hippo and elephant bird bones and one extinct aye-aye tooth. New evidence comes not from archaeological sites, but from specimens collected in the early 1900s, without stratigraphic records, at "subfossil" sites (i.e., sites renowned for their late Pleistocene or Holocene fossils, often lacking human artifacts). Whereas these are hardly the most ideal samples for analysis of this kind, careful scrutiny of the characteristics of the cut marks has allowed us to document butchery beyond any reasonable doubt. One bone with definitive cut marks has been dated to the very earliest part of the human period in Madagascar. Continued, careful research on the bones in subfossil collections is warranted.},

 abstract = {Running is one of the most accessible physical activities and running with and without footwear has attracted extensive attention in the past several years. In this study 18 habitually male unshod runners and 20 habitually male shod runners (all with dominant right feet) participated in a running test. A Vicon motion analysis system was used to capture the kinematics of each participant's lower limb. The in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system was employed to measure the pressure and force exerted on the pressure sensors of the insole. The function of a separate hallux in unshod runners is analyzed through the comparison of plantar pressure parameters. Owing to the different strike patterns in shod and unshod runners, peak dorsiflexion and plantarflexion angle were significantly different. Habitually shod runners exhibited a decreased foot strike angle (FSA) under unshod conditions; and the vertical average loading rate (VALR) of shod runners under unshod conditions was larger than that under shod conditions. This suggests that the foot strike pattern is more important than the shod or unshod running style and runners need to acquire the technique. It can be concluded that for habitually unshod runners the separate hallux takes part of the foot loading and reduces loading to the forefoot under shod conditions. The remaining toes of rearfoot strike (RFS) runners function similarly under unshod conditions. These morphological features of shod and unshod runners should be considered in footwear design to improve sport performance and reduce injury. },

Their remains are frequently found in faunal assemblages, their bones were used for the construction of dwellings, and they figure significantly in Palaeolithic art. Mammoths became extinct in North America at ca. 11,000 BP, in Eurasia at ca. 12,000 BP, and in Siberia at ca. 10,000 BP, and there has been considerable debate as to whether human predation was a causal factor. The computer simulation model described in this paper explores the effect of different types of hunting strategies on mammoth populations in a range of different environmental situations. It demonstrates that mammoth populations are extremely sensitive to predation. The simulation results are discussed with reference to the settlements on the Central Russian Plain. The results agree with Soffer's suggestion that the majority of mammoth remains probably derive from collecting, rather than hunting.},

 abstract = {The lower stratigraphic sequence (units III–VI) of the Middle Palaeolithic site of Nesher Ramla was studied using geoarchaeological methods. Field observations indicate that the site formed within a karst depression that was infilled by colluvium and in which intermittent human activity occurred, including two layers highly rich in anthropogenic remains (units III and V). Infrared analysis of bones determined that black bones are carbonized and that certain white bones are calcined. Quantitative analysis of wood ash pseudomorphs indicates specific areas of high concentrations of ash. Micromorphological analysis enabled identification of two distinct features associated with ash and burnt bones. One is a thinly bedded complex of blacked soil overlain by ash and charcoal, and the second is a ∼20 cm thick massive, fine-grained layer of mixed ash. The first feature is interpreted as an in situ hearth. Macroscopically similar features have not yet been analyzed. The second feature is interpreted as ash in secondary position, i.e., an ash pile/midden that formed following hearth rake-out activities. These findings are unique considering that most Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites in the Levant are single-layered, and that in most evidence for hominin use of fire is scarce or absent. We discuss the factors that may affect the preservation of ash in open-air sites, and conclude that the setting of Nesher Ramla in a topographic low provided relative protection from wind which prevented ash deflation, and at the same time, hominin activity remains were buried relatively fast which detached the ashes and combustion features from direct rainfall and from decalcifying root activity.},

 abstract = {Abstract A zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis is presented for the faunal remains from the Pundo shell midden in northern Nyanza province (Kenya), which contains Kansyore ceramics and dates to ca. 8000–7600 cal. BP. The faunal assemblage is overwhelmingly dominated by fish and molluscs, of which only the fish data are presented in detail. Taxonomic identifications suggest a diachronic change in relative species abundance, with cichlids becoming increasingly dominant, eventually comprising nearly 80% of the fish assemblage. The Pundo faunal data are compared with those from a number of other Kansyore sites. Pundo confirms that early Kansyore sites are purely forager sites, with domestic caprines only appearing at late Kansyore sites (post‐dating ca. 4400 cal. BP). Comparing ethological data for fish taxa found at Pundo and other lakeshore shell middens with those for fish taxa found at larger riverside sites, a seasonal round is suggested, in which short‐term fishing camps such as Pundo may have been occupied in the dry season, while riverside sites were probably occupied during the rainy season.

 abstract = {Reciprocity theory (RT) and costly signaling theory (CST) provide different explanations for the high status of pro-community altruists: RT proposes that altruists are positively and negatively sanctioned by others, whereas CST proposes that altruists are attractive to others. Only RT, however, is beset by first- and higher-order free rider problems, which must be solved in order for RT to explain status allocations. In this paper, several solutions to RT’s free rider problems are proposed, and data about status allocations to Ecuadorian Shuar pro-community altruists are analyzed in light of RT and CST. These data confirm that perceived pro-community altruists are indeed high status and suggest that (1) community residents skillfully monitor the altruism of coresidents, (2) residents who engage in opportunities to broadcast desirable qualities are high status only to the extent that they are considered altruistic, and (3) individuals who sanction coresidents based on coresidents’ contributions to the community are themselves relatively high status. To a greater extent than CST, RT straightforwardly predicts all of these results.},

This analysis weighs the preliminary results of a regional study in Mendoza against three possible explanations for the small number of middle Holocene sites: poor visibility, reduced population density and behavioural adaptation. While changes in visibility and population density cannot be dismissed, evidence suggests that the scarcity of mid-Holocene sites in Mendoza reflects changed patterns of land and resource use triggered by climate change. Archaeological data from the region fit the predictions of Charnov's marginal value theorem and a cost-benefit model of lithic procurement, and suggest that hunter-gatherer groups curtailed their mobility during the middle Holocene, producing a more cryptic archaeological record.},

 abstract = { The significant impact of extant carnivores, particularly spotted hyenas, on the depositional history and physical characteristics of archaeofaunal and paleontological assemblages is well recognized. We focus on the behavioral ecology of extant spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) in relation to bone accumulations produced by one East African clan at communal dens. Limbs and skulls of prey animals more frequently appear at dens than do other carcass portions. These items reflect the relative abundance of prey species near dens; carnivore remains are poorly represented. Comparative analysis reveals that bones are deposited far more slowly (<7 carcass portions per month) and accumulations tend to be smaller at Crocuta dens than at dens of either brown ( Parahyaena brunnea ) or striped ( Hyaena hyaena ) hyenas. We propose that extant Crocuta bone accumulation rates and sizes are likely affected by prey species abundance, clan size, social interactions within the clan, and the type and availability of den sites. We also suggest that the potential for intraspecific behavioral variability in bone accumulation patterns is important when comparisons are made among spotted hyena populations and across hyena species. For example, accumulation patterns may be dramatically influenced by the temporal span, potentially ranging from days to hundreds or thousands of years, in which bones are collected, depending on the species-specific history of occupation at a given site. Understanding the behavioral and ecological variability likely to influence bone accumulation patterns at dens used by different hyaenids will allow taphonomists and zooarchaeologists to refine their knowledge of mechanisms underlying site formation processes and potential causes of variability in deeper-time den assemblages. },

 abstract = {Neandertals disappeared from Europe just after 40,000 years ago. Some hypotheses ascribe this to numerous population crashes associated with glacial cycles in the late Pleistocene. The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis that glacial periods stressed Neandertal populations. If cold climates stressed Neandertals, their subsistence behaviors may have changed-requiring intensified use of prey through more extensive nutrient extraction from faunal carcasses. To test this, an analysis of Neandertal butchering was conducted on medium sized bovid/cervid remains composed of predominately red deer (Cervus elaphus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and roe deer (Capreolus caprelous) deposited during global warm and cold phases from two French sites: Pech de l'Azé IV (Pech IV, Bordes' excavation) and Roc de Marsal (RDM). Analysis of surface modification on high survival long bones and proximal and middle phalanges demonstrates that skeletal elements excavated from the cold levels (RDM Level 4, Pech IV Level I2) at each cave have more cut marks and percussion marks than elements from the warm levels (RDM Level 9, Pech IV Level Y-Z) after controlling for fragment size. At both sites, epiphyseal fragments are rare, and although this pattern can result from carnivore consumption, carnivore tooth marks are almost nonexistent (<0.1%). Alternatively, processing epiphyseal ends for bone grease may have been a Neandertal survival strategy, and epiphyses were more intensively percussed in cold levels than in warm levels at both RDM and Pech IV. The exploitation of low marrow yield elements such as phalanges does not show a consistent pattern relating to climate, but may have been a general Neandertal behavioral characteristic, suggesting that these hominids were regularly on the edge of sufficient nutrient availability even during interglacials. Overall, the faunal assemblages from Roc de Marsal and Pech IV provide some support for the hypothesis that Neandertals were processing faunal remains more heavily during glacial periods, suggesting a response to increased nutritional stress during colder time periods.},

 abstract = {The study of Y chromosome variation has helped reconstruct demographic events associated with the spread of languages, agriculture, and pastoralism in sub-Saharan Africa, but little attention has been given to the early history of the continent. In order to overcome this lack of knowledge, we carried out a phylogeographic analysis of haplogroups A and B in a broad data set of sub-Saharan populations. These two lineages are particularly suitable for this objective because they are the two most deeply rooted branches of the Y chromosome genealogy. Their distribution is almost exclusively restricted to sub-Saharan Africa where their frequency peaks at 65% in groups of foragers. The combined high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with short tandem repeats variation of their subclades reveals strong geographic and population structure for both haplogroups. This has allowed us to identify specific lineages related to regional preagricultural dynamics in different areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we observed signatures of relatively recent contact, both among Pygmies and between them and Khoisan speaker groups from southern Africa, thus contributing to the understanding of the complex evolutionary relationships among African hunter-gatherers. Finally, by revising the phylogeography of the very early human Y chromosome lineages, we have obtained support for the role of southern Africa as a sink, rather than a source, of the first migrations of modern humans from eastern and central parts of the continent. These results open new perspectives on the early history of Homo sapiens in Africa, with particular attention to areas of the continent where human fossil remains and archaeological data are scant.},

 abstract = {This chapter examines large-scale patterns of behavioral change that are often viewed as indicators for the advent of cultural modernity and developed symbolic communication. Using examples from Africa and Eurasia, the chapter reviews patterns of lithic and organic technology, subsistence, and settlement as potential indicators of modern behavior. These areas of research produce a mosaic picture of advanced technology and behavioral patterns that come and go during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene. Based on these data the emergence of modern behavior, as seen in the archaeologically visible material record, appears to be gradual and heterogeneous in space and time. During the early part of the Late Pleistocene, personal ornaments in the form of perforated seashells are documented in southwestern Asia and northern and southern Africa. By about 40,000 years ago (Ka), a diverse array of personal ornaments are documented across the Old World in association with Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. These include both modified natural objects and fully formed ornaments. The timing and distribution of the appearance of figurative art, mythical imagery, and other classes of artifacts including musical instruments point to a more punctuated development of fully modern behavior during the middle of the Late Pleistocene and certainly no later than 40 Ka. Due perhaps in part to the long and intense history of research, much, but by no means all, of the relevant data come from Europe. Early figurative art from the Aurignacian of southwestern Germany, northern Italy, Austria, and southern France provides undisputed evidence for fully developed symbolic communication and behavioral modernity. This chapter also discusses some of the hypotheses for the development and spread of cultural modernity and rejects a strict monogenetic model in favor of a pattern of mosaic polycentric development. This chapter highlights the need for new refutable, regional and superregional hypotheses for the advent and spread of behavioral modernity.},

 abstract = {In this paper, cut marks on the long bones of class II sized animals in the Ma’anshann site are studied. Based on the location and frequencies of the long bone cut marks, the distribution characteristics are analyzed as follows: (1) cut mark frequencies in the lower layer (LL) are much higher than those of the upper; (2) in the LL cut mark frequency of the upper limbs is the highest, and that of the middle and lower limbs is lower and the lowest; (3) In the upper layer (UL) the cut mark frequency, does not spread as orderly as in the LL. The data are compared to those of the experiment and it is demonstrated that values of the LL all fall into the experimental 95% confidence intervals, and the cut mark frequencies of the upper, middle and lower limbs coincide with those of the experiment; while the values of the UL are much lower, of which, those of the humerus, femur and radius are out of the intervals, and the frequencies of the upper, middle and lower limbs are far more different from those of the experiment. It implies that the earlier hominids (of the LL) defleshed the limbs of the class II sized animals with stone tools more completely than the later hominids. With the evidence of burning marks, it is suggested that the difference on the roasting behaviors derived the cut mark difference of the Ma’anshan UL and LL.},

 abstract = {The diets of Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus are hypothesized to have included C4 plants, such as tropical grasses and sedges, or the tissues of animals which themselves consumed C4 plants. Yet inferences based on the craniodental morphology of A. africanus and P. robustus indicate a seasonal diet governed by hard, brittle foods. Such mechanical characteristics are incompatible with a diet of grasses or uncooked meat, which are too tough for efficient mastication by flat, low-cusped molars. This discrepancy, termed the C4 conundrum, has led to the speculation that C4 plant underground storage organs (USOs) were a source of nutrition for hominin species. We test this hypothesis by examining the isotopic ecology of African mole rats, which consume USOs extensively. We measured delta18O and delta13C of enamel and bone apatite from fossil and modern species distributed across a range of habitats. We show that delta18O values vary little and that delta13C values vary along the C3 to C4/CAM-vegetative axis. Relatively high delta13C values exist in modern Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis and Cryptomys spp. recovered from hominin-bearing deposits. These values overlap those reported for A. africanus and P. robustus and we conclude that the USO hypothesis for hominin diets retains certain plausibility.},

 abstract = {Reported here are the results of a taphonomic analysis of the small mammals (between 0.75 kg and 4.5 kg adult body weight) and size 1 bovids (≤20 kg adult body weight) from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites of Die Kelders Cave 1 (DK1) and Pinnacle Point Site 5-6 (PP5-6), Western Cape Province, South Africa. This study provides a comprehensive taphonomic analysis of MSA small mammals with a focus on discerning the role of humans in their accumulation and the implications for human behavioral adaptations. Based on comparisons with control assemblages of known accumulation, it is evident that humans accumulated many of the Cape dune mole-rats, hares, and size 1 bovids at DK1. The patterning of cut-marked and burned mole-rat remains at DK1 provides evidence in the MSA for the systematic utilization of small mammals for their skins and as a protein source. Unlike DK1, small mammals and size 1 bovids constitute only a small portion of the PP5-6 mammals and they exhibit little evidence of human accumulation. Nocturnal and diurnal raptors accumulated most of the small fauna at PP5-6. The nominal presence of small mammals in the PP5-6 fauna is atypical of MSA sites in the Cape Floristic Region, where they are abundant and often constitute large portions of MSA archaeofaunas. DK1 humans maximized the environmental yield by exploiting low-quality resources, a strategy employed possibly in response to localized environmental conditions and to greater human population densities. In comparison, the MIS5-4 humans at PP5-6 did not exploit small mammals and instead focused on higher-quality resources like shellfish and large ungulates. Humans and predators accumulated few small mammals at PP5-6, suggesting that these taxa may have been less abundant near the site and/or that humans could afford to concentrate on high-quality resources, perhaps because of a higher-yield local environment. This study suggests that an adaptive response to the environmental conditions of MIS4 was to maximize the resource yield of local habitats to include lower-quality resources when necessary. The incorporation of these resources in the face of changing environmental and perhaps population pressures is a subsistence adaptation that played a crucial role in the population stability and expansion evidenced by the number of sites in the Cape dating to MIS4.},

A taphonomic analysis of the faunal remains strongly indicates that hominids have a dominant role in the accumulation and modification of the assemblage. Based on the taphonomic and zooarcheological characteristics of the animal remains, including species richness, mortality patterns, skeletal element profiles, and bone surface-modifications, and on the local ecology, we suggest that the Lingjing site is a Middle Paleolithic kill-butchery site rather than a home base for early humans. The presence of large numbers of stone artifacts may therefore signify a strong sense of planning and farsightedness in the subsistence strategies of early human groups. The Lingjing site is presently the only taphonomically-identified, Middle Paleolithic kill-butchery site known in North China.},

 abstract = {In 2004, a new hominin species, Homo floresiensis, was described from Late Pleistocene cave deposits at Liang Bua, Flores. H. floresiensis was remarkable for its small body-size, endocranial volume in the chimpanzee range, limb proportions and skeletal robusticity similar to Pliocene Australopithecus, and a skeletal morphology with a distinctive combination of symplesiomorphic, derived, and unique traits. Critics of H. floresiensis as a novel species have argued that the Pleistocene skeletons from Liang Bua either fall within the range of living Australomelanesians, exhibit the attributes of growth disorders found in modern humans, or a combination of both. Here we describe the morphology of the LB1, LB2, and LB6 mandibles and mandibular teeth from Liang Bua. Morphological and metrical comparisons of the mandibles demonstrate that they share a distinctive suite of traits that place them outside both the H. sapiens and H. erectus ranges of variation. While having the derived molar size of later Homo, the symphyseal, corpus, ramus, and premolar morphologies share similarities with both Australopithecus and early Homo. When the mandibles are considered with the existing evidence for cranial and postcranial anatomy, limb proportions, and the functional anatomy of the wrist and shoulder, they are in many respects closer to African early Homo or Australopithecus than to later Homo. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the ancestors of H. floresiensis left Africa before the evolution of H. erectus, as defined by the Dmanisi and East African evidence.},

With the advent of industrialization, globalization, and modern sanitation, it is intuitive that we have changed our relationship with microbes, but we have little information about the ancestral state of our microbiome, and we therefore lack a foundation for characterizing this change. High-throughput sequencing has opened up new opportunities in the field of paleomicrobiology, allowing us to investigate the evolution of the complex microbial ecologies that inhabit our bodies.

In this paper, I use such a model to examine how New Zealand foragers altered their use of moa carcasses as the availability of these large birds declined. Moa data from the Shag River Mouth site in southern New Zealand are analyzed to test changes in butchery/transport and skeletal element breakage patterns expected with resource depression and declining foraging efficiency.

In 2015 and 2016, research trips in the Central, Western, Eastern and Northern Regions of Uganda were conducted to screen the cultivated and natural flora for baobabs. As a result, four vigorous baobab trees aged 9 and 22 years were identified in two gardens in the Iganga and Soroti Districts in the Eastern Region of Uganda. The origins of the planting materials were Nyala in Sudan and Mombasa in Kenya. To our knowledge, these are the first scientific records of baobab in Uganda and some research questions and key propositions are formulated based on this discovery.},

 abstract = {Analogical frameworks created through experimentation are a vital part of taphonomic studies for interpreting the archaeological record. Understanding the anatomical location of cut marks is crucial for interpreting the butchery behaviour of humans in the past, as well as for indirectly inferring the subsistence and economic function of archaeological sites. Two experimental/ethnoarchaeological studies have provided taphonomists with analogues to interpret filleting and disarticulation butchery behaviours from archaeofaunal assemblages. However, these analogues were made with limited control and both involved the use of metal knives. The present work provides the first systematic and controlled study of cut mark distribution on long bones made with stone tools, aimed at differentiating cut marks created by filleting or defleshing from those inflicted during disarticulation. It also studies the variability of cut mark distribution according to stone tool type (simple flakes, retouched flakes and handaxes). The results show some differences with previous studies made with metal tools and offer an updated analogue to interpret butchery (filleting, dismembering and skinning) from prehistoric contexts.},

This article (a) contextualizes the conference and the subsequent discussion of greed and excess within the broader narratives of causation and accusation between various actors and groups involved in and affected by the outcomes of differential accumulation and consumption of resources, (b) introduces the various articles raging from archaeology to ethnography and commentaries by noted anthropologists that may potentially inform the larger debate on greed and excess within anthropology, and even generate new directions for collaborative anthropological inquiry into “greed and excess” and the human condition . },

 abstract = {This chapter examines the history of the past century and current practice of conservation in Tanzania. In pre-colonial times, conservation was achieved through culture and traditions, and without any written decrees or formal institutional framework. German and British colonialists successively began the process of reserving protected areas and of promulgating legislation that instituted central control over wildlife resources. The process of reserving protected areas continued after Independence, and these efforts were helped considerably by other national policies such as villagisation that drew people into more centralised settlements. Tanzania now has one of the most extensive protected area networks in Africa, and some unrivalled wildlife resources. However, it also has a very complex sector with several wildlife authorities managing different categories of protected area and different types of wildlife utilisation.Game viewing is an important economic use of protected areas, primarily national parks, in the north. Hunting by tourists is an important economic use of game reserves and other areas across the country. These forms of wildlife use bring fees to wildlife authorities and central government and greatly benefit the private sector. They also provide direct benefit to local communities from land on which they coexist with the wildlife that is being utilised. Hunting by residents is an important activity for urban Tanzanians but provides little revenue to central government and no benefit to local communities. Trade in live animals and use of products from animals killed on control provide some legal benefits to local communities. However, most local communities now use wildlife illegally or convert land to other uses. Therefore, the Tanzanian government requested advice on policy formulation in the early 1990s. The policies recommended include retaining the unsettled, protected areas as the core of conservation activity, instituting a programme of community- based conservation where humans and wildlife co-exist, and rationalising the institutions involved in the wildlife sector.},

                  Early Holocene cultural material at Gerstle River, central Alaska, provides excellent contextual controls for examining variability in radiocarbon dating. Over 4,000 bone and teeth fragments are directly associated with over 7,000 lithic artifacts and 10 discrete charcoal-rich hearths in a thin occupation layer (∼10 cm vertical thickness) within well-stratified loess deposits. Radiocarbon dating of the hearth features indicates overlapping ages at 2σ, suggesting contemporaneity. This study uses the high level of resolution at Gerstle River to evaluate systematic radiocarbon variation due to different materials (collagen and charcoal), different pretreatments of collagen (regular and ultrafiltered), and interlaboratory variation through paired bone and hearth charcoal dates, split samples, and cross-checks. Accurately dating bone collagen is important given the closer association of dated samples with human activities (e.g., butchering) compared with charcoal fragments in certain contexts (e.g., driftwood, paleosols, or alluvial deposits). This study demonstrates the efficacy of bone collagen dating with ultrafiltration to counter potential site-specific contamination. These results also indicate that even in high-resolution situations with little evidence for old-wood effect and contamination, considerable variability can exist among cross-check and even split samples from single pieces of charcoal from short-lived species.

Más de 4.000 fragmentos de huesos y dientes son directamente asociadas con más de 7.000 artefactos líicos y 10 hogares discretos conteniendo carbón en una ocupación de una capa delgada (∼ 10 cm de espesor vertical) depósitos de loess bien estratificados. La dotación por radiocarbono de las características del hogar indica una superposición de edades entre 2σ lo que sugiere la contemporaneidad. Este estudio utiliza el alto nivel de resolución en Gerstle River para evaluar la variación de radiocarbono sistemática por razón de diversos materiales (colágeno y carbón), diferentes pretratamientos de colágeno (regular y ultrafiltrado), y variación entre laboratorios a través de datación del hueso emparejado y las fechas de carbón de hogar, muestras divididas, y comprobaciones cruzadas. Este estudio demuestra la eficacia de colágeno de los huesos que datan de ultrafütración contra la contaminación potencial. Efectivamente datación por colágeno de los huesos es importante por asociación en general, más cerca de las muestras de fecha con las actividades humanas (por ejemplo, despiece) de fragmentos de carbón vegetal. Estos resultados indican también que incluso en situaciones de alta resolución con poca evidencia de efecto de madera vieja y la contaminación, puede existir una variabilidad considerable entre cotejo e incluso las muestras divididas de solas piezas de carbón vegetal de especies de vida corta.},

As a result, it is often implicitly assumed that hominins, if present, were scarce in the Early Pleistocene European ecosystems. Here we present a quantitative assessment of the rarity and commonness of the European large mammal species during the 1.4–0.8Ma period, including hominins. Considering the palaeontological record only, Homo was not one of the most common species in Europe, but it may not be considered a rare species. In contrast, taking into consideration the archaeological record, hominins exhibit a wide geographical distribution and a high frequency of occurrence (occupancy) in comparison with other large mammals. It is speculated that hominins were frequent but not abundant in Europe during the late Early Pleistocene.},

We examined whether competition based on neuronal excitability also governs the interaction between engrams. Mice received two distinct fear conditioning events separated by different intervals. LA neuron excitability was optogenetically manipulated and revealed a transient competitive process that integrates memories for events occurring closely in time (coallocating overlapping populations of neurons to both engrams) and separates memories for events occurring at distal times (disallocating nonoverlapping populations to each engram).},

Jh. zeichneten sich die Umrisse eines neuen evolutionären Paradigmas in der Entwicklungspsychologie ab. Die drei Hauptmuster der Bindung (unsicher vermeidend, sicher, unsicher ambivalent) wurden nun nicht nur als Ergebnis unmittelbarer frühkindlicher Erfahrungen angesehen, sondern auch als Ergebnis evolutionärer Anpassungsprozesse. In der Life History-Theorie wird Bindung als anfängliches Stadium der Reproduktionsstrategie im Lebenslauf angesehen. Für Sozialisations- und Erziehungstheorien in Deutschland geht von diesen Forschungen die Botschaft aus, dass die kulturelle Transmission nicht nur über sozialisatorische Mechanismen oder erzieherische Anstrengungen verläuft, sondern auch über fortwirkende Faktoren des evolutionären Echos. In englischsprachigen Handbüchern der kulturvergleichenden Psychologie und der Entwicklungspsychologie hat sich der Ausdruck „biological and cultural transmission of culture“ eingebürgert. Vielleicht ist es an der Zeit, dass ein vergleichbarer Ausdruck auch in deutschen Handbüchern der Sozialisations-und Erziehungsforschung eingeführt wird.},

 abstract = {Four localities (Fenske, Mud Lake, Schaefer, and Hebior) in southeastern Wisconsin have been put forth as probable sites associated with early peoples based on purported cultural marks on bones and lithic artifacts. Only two of the localities (Schaefer and Hebior) have associated lithics. Radiocarbon dates provide a time period of ca. 13,530–11,200yr BP. Results of the taphonomic analysis regarding natural modifications are reported elsewhere and the potential cultural modification category was examined further using established criteria as well as additional features. Two mark types are identified as caused by human agency. Foot elements are most affected by marks, followed by long bones. The marks indicate two major activities occurring, that of cutting actions in defleshing and prying or leverage actions in disarticulation. The Mud Lake and Fenske mammoth are found carcasses already stiffened when scavenged by people. Schaefer most likely represents a hunted animal while Hebior being a hunted or found fresh carcasses could not be determined. The resource procurement strategy, whether the carcass is fresh or stiffened, appears to be the same. Easily accessible legs and feet form the focal point and provide a sizeable amount of protein from muscle bundles and fat from foot pads. Based on the Wisconsin localities, both hunting and scavenging of mammoth by early peoples have a time depth in the late Pleistocene beyond the Clovis-age.},

 abstract = {The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of bone collagen has been determined for 238 modern non-human mammals, comprising 43 species of herbivores and carnivores from grasslands and montane forests in Kenya and Tanzania, and 97 historic and prehistoric humans, representing 12 populations with different dietary adaptations from eastern and southern Africa. Among non-human species carbon isotope ratios separate grazers from browsers in open grasslands, forest floor from forest canopy, and forest floor from open grassland feeders. Nitrogen isotopes separate carnivores from herbivores and forest from savanna-living species. Water-dependent herbivores have lower nitrogen isotope ratios than drought-tolerant ones in the same habitat. Among human populations, carbon isotopes differentiate those who regularly consume grains and/or the protein of browsing animals from those who consume wild plants, non-grain crops and/or the protein of wild animals. Nitrogen isotopes differentiate those dependent on the milk, meat and blood of domestic animals or marine resources from those dependent mainly on plant foods. Combined use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes permits the differentiation of pastoralists from farmers, camel pastoralists from capri-bovine pastoralists, and grain farmers from non-grain farmers. The apparent presence of physiological and climatic influences on nitrogen isotope ratios within trophic levels complicates dietary interpretations of variations in nitrogen isotope ratios but may also offer a new tool of climatic reconstruction. It shoudl nonetheless be possible to use the analysis of the isotopic composition of bone collagen as a quantitative technique for the reconstruction of diet, habitat selection, climate and water balance in prehistoric animal and human communities, and to test models that suggest dietary adaptations were prime movers of hominid biological and cultural evolution.},

 abstract = {Bison remains are a common and important component of many North American archaeological and paleontological sites. Interpretations of bison remains, however, often are hampered by the inability to determine sex reliably in this dimorphic taxon. Metapodials are among the most common bison element recovered in archaeological assemblages, but have proven difficult to sex. The methods currently in use to estimate sex range from those using only bivariate plots and ratios of various metapodial measurements to those using discriminant function analysis. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, with no one method producing certain, unambiguous results. The designation of sex in borderline specimens remains uncertain in all current methods and must be determined subjectively. By reducing data through the use of ratios, the current bivariate methods fail to make full use of the size variation present between male and female bison. The requirements of discriminant function analysis likewise limit this method’s utility for sexing metapodials, particularly for assemblages containing small sample sizes. The use of principal component analysis utilizing several of the most dimorphic, commonly measured variables produces a more confident assessment of sex for both complete and partial specimens of modern bison metapodials.},

Associated faunal evidence, however, is poorly preserved prior to ≈ 1.8 Ma, limiting our understanding of early archaeological (Oldowan) hominin carnivory. Here, we detail three large well-preserved zooarchaeological assemblages from Kanjera South, Kenya. The assemblages date to 2.0 Ma, pre-dating all previously published archaeofaunas of appreciable size. At Kanjera, there is clear evidence that Oldowan hominins acquired and processed numerous, relatively complete, small ungulate carcasses. Moreover, they had at least occasional access to the fleshed remains of larger, wildebeest-sized animals. The overall record of hominin activities is consistent through the stratified sequence - spanning hundreds to thousands of years - and provides the earliest archaeological evidence of sustained hominin involvement with fleshed animal remains (i.e., persistent carnivory), a foraging adaptation central to many models of hominin evolution.},

 abstract = {The primary mode of faunal exploitation by Neandertals and early modern humans remains a debated topic. Binford (1981, 1984, 1985, 1988) has argued for an obligate scavenging mode, Stiner (1991a, 1991b, 1991c, 1993, 1994) for a more opportunistic scavenging mode, while other researchers (Chase, 1986, 1988, 1989; Klein, 1989, 1994, 1995; Klein & Cruz-Uribe, 1996) deny the importance of scavenging as a faunal exploitation tactic. The scavenging interpretations rely primarily on several patterns in the faunal remains: the presence of a skeletal element pattern dominated by heads or head and foot parts, the presence of carnivore tooth marks on bone fragments, and infrequent cut marks that typically are not located on shaft regions of long bones or on fleshy bones. Five sites have been used to argue for scavenging: Klasies River Mouth, Combe Grenal, Grotta Guattari, Grotta dei Moscerini, and Grotte Vaufrey. The former four of the five sites are biased samples in that long bone shafts and other difficult to identify fragments were discarded at excavation. The analysis of Grotte Vaufrey included only those shafts identifiable to species or genus, thus excluding the vast majority of shaft specimens. This bias systematically shapes the skeletal element and surface modification patterning in ways that make the assemblages appear to fit a model of scavenging, when in fact the main determinant of the pattern is the bias in the flawed samples. This problem is illustrated with two unbiased faunal assemblages (Kobeh Cave and Die Kelders Layer 10). Skeletal element abundance is calculated in a way that mimics the bias in the sites listed above by excluding the shafts. Using this procedure, both Kobeh and Die Kelders have a head and foot skeletal element pattern and thus appear scavenged. Both assemblages are then analyzed in their entirety and a new pattern, consistent with hunting, is revealed. Taphonomic data on bone survival and destruction provide an explanation for this result. Excluding shaft fragments from the analysis also biases the surface modification patterning in such a way as to produce a pattern more consistent with scavenging. The conclusion is that there is no reliable evidence for scavenging by Neandertals or early modern humans.},

I consider the likely behavioral ecology of A. ramidus and the relevance of the great apes for understanding the earliest stages of hominin evolution. I argue that the Ardipithecus fossils strongly support a chimpanzee model for early hominin behavioral ecology. They indicate a chimpanzee-like hominoid that appears to be an early biped or semibiped, adapted to both terrestrial and arboreal substrates.

In this paper, through the quantification and statistical analyses of the skeletal elements of the two predominant species in this assemblage, aurochs (Bos primigenius) and horse (Equus caballus), the differential influences and weights of a variety of taphonomic agencies in the formation of the assemblage are assessed respectively. Compared to the natural agencies, hominid hunting and the subsequent disarticulation, slaughtering, and their transport of the bone elements of the prey species are the main factors accounting for the formation of the present assemblage. More importantly, this study initiatively identifies hominid’s differential treatment of the bones of aurochs and horse in the Paleolithic record of East Asia and demonstrably suggests that hominids at the site have already practiced sophisticated hunting techniques and subsistence strategies and may be quite familiar with the ecological and anatomical characteristics and nutritional values of the large-sized prey animals and can accordingly take different processing and handling strategies at the hunting site.},

 abstract = {Chimpanzee hunting provides information on prey characteristics and constraints acting on a large-bodied primate lacking a hunting technology, and has important implications for modeling hunting by fossil hominids. Analysis of the remains of five red colobus monkeys captured and consumed by Gombe chimpanzees in a single hunting bout provides one of the first opportunities to investigate the characteristics of prey bones surviving chimpanzee consumption. Four of the five individuals (an older infant, two juveniles and one subadult) were preserved in the bone assemblage; a neonate was entirely consumed. Cranial and mandibular fragments had the highest survivorships, followed by the scapulae and long bones. Post-cranial axial elements had the lowest survivorships. A high percentage (80%) of the long bones and ribs surviving consumption were damaged, most commonly through crenulation and step fracturing of bone ends. One of two partially reconstructed crania preserves a canine puncture through its left parietal. Proposed characteristics of faunal assemblages formed through chimpanzee-like hunting include small modal prey size, limited taxonomic diversity, a high proportion of immature individuals and a high frequency of skull bones. These characteristics would not uniquely identify hunting by fossil primates in the geological record, necessitating a contextual approach to diagnose hunting by hominids not forming an archeological record. Hominid utilization of vertebrate tissue is first unambiguously documented at 2.5 m.y.a. Rather than representing a strict "scavenging phase" in the evolution of hominid-prey interactions, Oldowan hominid carnivory may represent the overlay of large mammal scavenging on a tradition of small mammal hunting having a low archeological visibility.},

We present in this chapter a general outline of this debate in different domains of the archeological research, from technology and subsistence to spatial patterns. Moreover, we point out that these behavioral issues should be approached by taking into account the temporal nature of the archeological assemblages, since temporal resolution may be a primary factor in interassemblage variability. Due to these time-dependent formation processes, Abric Romaní appears as a site particularly suitable to yield information on Neanderthal behavior.},

 abstract = {The presence of elephants, and specifically of elephant head remains, is well demonstrated in many Paleolithic sites in Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, the possible mechanisms for the exploitation of this enormous body part are rarely discussed, and it is often suggested that elephants' heads were exploited specifically for the extraction and consumption of the brain. In this paper, we discuss the nutritional potential that lies within elephants' heads as implied by ethnographic and zoological literature, and present archaeological evidence from Paleolithic sites for the exploitation of proboscideans' heads. The data show that the prevailing view should be re-evaluated, and that the nutritional potential within the elephant's head extends far beyond the brain. We suggest that organs such as the temporal gland, the trunk, the tongue, the mandible and the skull itself were exploited routinely as an integral part of early humans' diet. The nutritional potential of the elephant head provides a parsimonious explanation for the investment early humans put into transporting and exploiting this specific body part at open-air sites but particularly at cave sites, and serves as a significant beacon in understanding Paleolithic human behavior in relation to proboscidean remains.},

The three approaches considered in detail are Optimal Foraging Theory, Decision Tree Modelling and Decision Making Pragmatics. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are summarized and examples from hunter-gatherer ethnography are given, in particular with reference to field research with Hai//om San in southern Africa. It is argued that there are ideas from abductive reasoning, non-monotonic logics and conversational analysis available which are promising to provide a more appropriate picture of mobility and other features of forager society since they incorporate continual revisions to decisions and explanations that are characteristic for this domain of research.},

 abstract = {In the past 20 years a body of research in behavioral and experimental economics has challenged classical economic theory. Yet, this body of research seems relatively unknown in business education. One behavioral test with implications for international business education has been the use of ultimatum games, which has more recently expanded to cross-cultural studies. Yet, virtually no cross-cultural studies have been conducted for subjects in Middle Eastern countries. One of the central findings from ultimatum game research and other variations is that individuals place a high value on fairness in transactions, a fundamentally ethical concept. This article reports a preliminary study of Kuwaiti and U.S. business students. Results are consistent with previous studies, showing Kuwaiti subjects to be in line with subjects from developed economies. Discussion includes the implications for management and business educators.},

 abstract = {Many Pleistocene caves and rock shelters contain evidence of carnivore and human activities. For this reason, it is common to recover at these sites faunal remains left by both biological agents. In order to explain the role that carnivores play at the archaeological sites it is necessary to analyse several elements, such as the taxonomical and skeletal representation, the age profiles, the ratio of NISP to MNI, the anthropogenic processing marks on the carcasses (location and purpose of cutmarks and burning and bone breakage patterns), carnivore damage (digested bones, location and frequencies of toothmarks and bone breakage), length of the long bones, frequencies of coprolites and vertical distribution of the faunal remains, inter alia. From this, the documentation of carnivores in a faunal assemblage with a clear anthropogenic component can be understood from three main phenomena: (1) the carnivores as accumulators and the use of the site as a den; (2) carnivores as scavengers of hominid refuse and; (3) carnivores as hominids’ prey. Of these three phenomena, the last one is the least documented at the Middle Pleistocene sites. From this perspective, here we present the case of the anthropogenic use of a lion (Panthera leo fossilis) from level TD10-1 of Gran Dolina (MIS 9, Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain). The lion bone remains show signs of direct interaction between this big cat and human groups that occupied Gran Dolina in these chronologies. From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge of the role developed by large carnivores in the anthropogenic contexts and to provide data on human use of these predators at the European Middle Pleistocene sites.},

 abstract = {Documentation of cutmarks is standard protocol in contemporary zooarchaeology. However, there is currently no consensus about how to best quantify them. This study examines differences in cutmark patterning using two approaches: 1) by means of an experiment, comparing a control cutmark pattern to ten simulated highly fragmented sets of front and rear limbs using %NISPcut as the quantitative unit, and 2) by quantifying an archaeological faunal assemblage using both the number of identifiable specimens (NISP) and the comprehensive minimum number of elements (cMNE). Results reveal significant differences in cutmark patterning between the control set and the simulated fragmented sets. Additionally, the ordinal-scale frequencies of cutmark anatomical portions (proximal, shaft, distal) are inconsistent and fluctuate across the simulated sets. Results of the zooarchaeological analysis show that differences between the two quantification methods are significant. In general, this study suggests that on heavily fragmented assemblages, interpretations of butchering behavior based on cutmark patterning are influenced by the chosen unit of quantification. Overall, using NISP as the quantitative unit provides inconsistent results, whereas, by alleviating the effects of high fragmentation, cMNE is more reliable.},

 abstract = {Abstract  The present detailed taphonomic study deals with faunal remains from the Middle Neolithic site of Fräkenrönningen, located in Eastern Middle Sweden. Archaeological excavations in 1993 revealed the remnants of eight hut‐structures and several different features spread over approximately 1500 m 2 . Large amounts of pottery and stone artefacts were recovered together with approximately 14.6 kg of burnt faunal remains. Our specific aim was to examine the depositional patterns of burnt bones at the site; the diversity between the huts and the sub‐areas between the huts. Spatial patterns of seal and fish bones as well as that of the anatomical representation of seals were investigated.   The refuse disposal patterns were spatially organised, and some site areas exhibited large refuse agglomerations of burnt bones. Most faunal remains were recovered immediately outside of the huts. The size of the huts did not correspond with absolute amounts of refuse. Both large and small huts showed a variation in amount of bones. The bones of harp seal ( Phoca groenlandica ) and ringed seal ( Phoca hispida ) were deposited in all areas of the site, showing a rather similar anatomical representation in all areas. The size of the huts was associated with the composition of the faunal remains. The huts in the western area were smaller in size than those in the eastern area, and they exhibited a higher frequency of fish bones. Interestingly, the fish bones showed the most marked variability between the different areas of the site. The largest amounts of fish bones were deposited in a restricted area of the north‐western part of the site, in association with three of the huts. The present study highlights the importance of detailed taphonomic studies of fishbone. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. },

 abstract = {Abstract Zooarchaeologists have established several criteria for differentiating hominid‐ and hyena‐derived faunal assemblages. In some cases, however, the patterns of skeletal part representation and bone surface modification on which these criteria are ultimately based have been observed in fossil bone assemblages of unknown origin, rather than in modern assemblages of known origin. When the proposed criteria are evaluated within an actualistic framework, only three are able to differentiate between hominid‐ and hyena‐created faunal assemblages. I suggest that only these three criteria—proportions of carnivores to ungulates in the assemblage, the preserved condition of long bone specimens (either as whole cylinders or as splintered shaft fragments), and the types of bone surface modifications—should be retained as important factors in a diagnosis of the ancient bone‐collector. The remaining four criteria—the relative proportion of horn pieces in the assemblage, the relative representation of podial bones, the relative representation of small and large bovid skeletal parts, and bovid mortality profiles—are not relevant or applicable to the problem of differentiating hominid‐ from hyena‐derived faunal assemblages.

Most political exchanges-whether they involve legislative vote trading, interbranch bargaining, constituent service, or even the corrupt exchange of public resources for private wealth-require reciprocity. But how does reciprocity arise? Do government officials learn reciprocity while holding office, or do recruitment and selection practices favor those who already adhere to a norm of reciprocity? We recruit Zambian politicians who narrowly won or lost a previous election to play behavioral games that provide a measure of reciprocity. This combination of regression discontinuity and experimental designs allows us to estimate the effect of holding office on behavior. We find that holding office increases adherence to the norm of reciprocity. This study identifies causal effects of holding office on politicians' behavior.},

 abstract = {Leporid (rabbit and hare) bones have been shown to yield important information about subsistence practices, mobility patterns, and demographic trends during the Paleolithic of the western and eastern Mediterranean regions. Studies of Spanish Paleolithic caves rich in rabbit bones suggest that residential mobility patterns influence the degree of leporid hunting through time. Studies of Paleolithic sites in the eastern Mediterranean suggest that leporids were hunted in large numbers only after population sizes and densities reached certain thresholds. This paper reviews and critiques these studies based on current taphonomic and ecologic information about leporids. Leporid hunting during the Upper Paleolithic of central Portugal is then discussed and compared to these existing models. These latter data suggest that rabbit hunting in central Portugal does not conform to any existing model, suggesting that local factors of leporid density and environmental conditions likely influenced the nature and timing of small game acquisition during the Upper Paleolithic.},

 abstract = {Reconstruction of early Pleistocene hominin carcass acquisition and processing behaviors are necessarily based at least in part on butchered fossil bones. This paper provides zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses and behavioral interpretations of three approximately 1.5 million-year-old archaeofaunas from areas 1A and 103 in the Okote Member of the Koobi Fora Formation, northern Kenya: FwJj14A, FwJj14B, and GaJi14. These sites are all located in similar paleoenvironmental contexts, near shallow water with swampy, seasonally flooded areas, and some evidence for more wooded or gallery forest settings. Both individual specimen--and assemblage-level analyses of butchery-marked bones indicate that the hominins appear to have practiced similar butchery strategies at all of these sites, with butchery (defleshing, disarticulation, and marrow extraction) of both high- and low-ranked skeletal elements with no apparent preference for prey size, skeletal region, limb class, or limb portion. Only four tooth-marked specimens, including one likely crocodile-tooth-marked bone, are preserved in all three archaeofaunas. A paucity of limb epiphyses suggests that bone-crunching hyenids may have deleted these portions subsequent to hominin butchery. Strangely, there are no stone tools preserved with the 292 cut-marked and 27 percussion-marked faunal specimens (out of a total of 6,039 specimens), suggesting that raw material availability may have conditioned hominin lithic discard patterns at these locales. These assemblages increase our knowledge of the dietary behavior and ecology of Homo erectus, and provide support for variability in early Pleistocene hominin carcass foraging patterns.},

 abstract = {Cut-marks on fossil bones and teeth are an important source of evidence in the reconstruction of ancient butchery practices. The analysis of butchery marks has allowed archaeologists to interpret aspects of past subsistence strategies and the behavior of early humans. Recent advances in optical scanning microscopy allow detailed measurements of cut-mark morphology to be undertaken. An example of this technology is the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope, which has been applied recently to the study of surface modifications on bones and teeth. Three-dimensional models generated by the Alicona microscope have been used to identify cross-sectional features of experimental cut-marks that are characteristic for specific cutting actions (e.g., slicing, chopping, scraping) and different tool types (e.g., metal versus stone tools). More recently, this technology has been applied successfully to the analysis of ∼500,000 year-old cut-marked animal bones from Boxgrove (U.K.), as well as cannibalized 14,700 cal BP year-old human bones from Gough's Cave (U.K.). This article describes molding methods used to replicate fragile prehistoric bones and teeth, where image quality was adversely affected by specimen translucency and reflectivity. Alicona images generated from molds and casts are often of better quality than those of the original specimen.},

 abstract = {This study of Middle Palaeolithic assemblages from the Rhone Valley, in the South-East of France, increases our understanding of Neanderthal subsistence strategies and modes of territorial organisation by comparing a wide corpus of human occupations in limited chronological and geographical frameworks. The Neanderthal occupation modes may be examined using sites located in a reduced area, linking medium-altitude territories (Massif Central and the Alpine foothills) to the Rhone corridor. Through the combined analysis of the occupation levels of ten sites, all dated to between Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 7 and the beginning of MIS 3, we identify three types of occupation durations: (1) type 1 as long-term residential camps, (2) type 2 as short-term regular hunting camps and (3) type 3 as brief stopover camps. We discuss this variability of habitat types according to various parameters: site age, technical behaviour, environmental conditions, and site localisation and occupation seasons. The aim is to discern the underlying motivations behind Neanderthal group mobility. One of the main features of the Rhone Valley area is the great homogeneity of behaviours reflected within the sequences. This homogeneity, linked to the variability of the site occupations, supports the hypothesis of Neanderthal groups anticipating their land use requirements, and furthermore suggests that another type of circulating model was used in this area.},

 abstract = {Recent studies of the evolution of religion have revealed the cognitive underpinnings of belief in supernatural agents, the role of ritual in promoting cooperation, and the contribution of morally punishing high gods to the growth and stabilization of human society. The universality of religion across human society points to a deep evolutionary past. However, specific traits of nascent religiosity, and the sequence in which they emerged, have remained unknown. Here we reconstruct the evolution of religious beliefs and behaviors in early modern humans using a global sample of hunter-gatherers and seven traits describing hunter-gatherer religiosity: animism, belief in an afterlife, shamanism, ancestor worship, high gods, and worship of ancestors or high gods who are active in human affairs. We reconstruct ancestral character states using a time-calibrated supertree based on published phylogenetic trees and linguistic classification and then test for correlated evolution between the characters and for the direction of cultural change. Results indicate that the oldest trait of religion, present in the most recent common ancestor of present-day hunter-gatherers, was animism, in agreement with long-standing beliefs about the fundamental role of this trait. Belief in an afterlife emerged, followed by shamanism and ancestor worship. Ancestor spirits or high gods who are active in human affairs were absent in early humans, suggesting a deep history for the egalitarian nature of hunter-gatherer societies. There is a significant positive relationship between most characters investigated, but the trait “high gods” stands apart, suggesting that belief in a single creator deity can emerge in a society regardless of other aspects of its religion.},

 abstract = {This chapter discusses the archaeological materials. It deals with the use of soil micromorphology for examining archaeological materials, in order to understand their formation and the manner in which they enter the archaeological record. Soil micromorphology, using optical microscopy and associated techniques, is one of the best methods for characterizing and identifying archaeological materials, especially when they occur as microscopic fragments at archaeological sites. In fact, although bulk and microfossil studies can provide useful supporting information, often the data from these techniques can only really be properly understood when soil micromorphology is available. Archaeological materials include natural mineral and organic materials that have been used in their raw state or as little transformed material, as well as fully manufactured products. Other archaeological matter includes waste from occupation, such as dung and mineralized coprolites from domestic animals, human waste, food, and hearth remains.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota is impacted by host nutrition and health status and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype influenced by metabolic and immune constraints. Previous studies contrasting rural populations in developing countries to urban industrialized ones have shown that industrialization is strongly correlated with patterns in human gut microbiota; however, we know little about the relative contribution of factors such as climate, diet, medicine, hygiene practices, host genetics, and parasitism. Here, we focus on fine-scale comparisons of African rural populations in order to (i) contrast the gut microbiota of populations inhabiting similar environments but having different traditional subsistence modes and either shared or distinct genetic ancestry, and (ii) examine the relationship between gut parasites and bacterial communities. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of Pygmy hunter-gatherers as well as Bantu individuals from both farming and fishing populations in Southwest Cameroon, we found that the gut parasite Entamoeba is significantly correlated with microbiome composition and diversity. We show that across populations, colonization by this protozoa can be predicted with 79% accuracy based on the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, and that several of the taxa most important for distinguishing Entamoeba absence or presence are signature taxa for autoimmune disorders. We also found gut communities to vary significantly with subsistence mode, notably with some taxa previously shown to be enriched in other hunter-gatherers groups (in Tanzania and Peru) also discriminating hunter-gatherers from neighboring farming or fishing populations in Cameroon. },

 abstract = {We carried out a detailed taphonomic study of the faunal remains from Nahal Hadera V (NHV), a large Kebaran open-air site on the northern coastal plain, Israel. Faunal remains were previously identified to bone element and species (Saxon, Martin & Bar-Yosef, 1978). However, NISP and MNI values were calculated based on teeth and epiphyses only. In this study we identified the maximum number of skeletal elements, including head fragments, vertebrae, ribs, carpals/tarsals, and shaft fragments. Further analyses included search for various bone surface modifications and the study of mode of bone fragmentation. We found minor loss of bones caused by various diagenetic processes, and no signs of carnivore activity. These results suggest that most of the bone destruction was caused during time of occupation, probably for marrow consumption, as indicated by mode of bone fragmentation. Absence of selective transport for gazelle (Gazella gazella) and fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica), the major prey species (with 70% and 20%, respectively), is supported by homogeneous representation of head-limb-toe elements. However, the carcasses may have been processed before transport to the site. Thus, a taphonomic analysis from NHV helps to illuminate the economy of NHV inhabitants and fine-tunes our understanding of the depositional history of the site. However, it does not overthrow results of earlier research using classical methods.},

 abstract = {Eastern Africa (broadly Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) has yielded the earliest fossils of modern humans, the earliest evidence for Mode 3 technologies (Middle Stone Age), and is one of the areas in which modern humans may well have been endemic. This paper reviews the genetic, archaeological, and fossil evidence for the evolution of modern humans across MIS 6-2 in eastern Africa, and places this into the context of Middle Pleistocene human evolution, the development of the Middle Stone Age across the continent, and climatic change over the last two glacial cycles. We argue that while there is a paucity of well-dated sites that reduces the resolution of any interpretation, the available evidence indicates a major role for eastern Africa as an area of endemism, most probably related to the interaction of mosaic environments and refugia. We show that the evolution of modern humans has roots that extend well before MIS 6, and propose four overlapping stages, making this a much more prolonged process than has traditionally been described. There is a broad relationship between evolutionary history and major climatic oscillations; nevertheless, a closer examination reveals a more complex pattern. There are periods of synchrony and asynchrony in both contextual and evolutionary/behavioral changes, and these show variable links to both northern and southern Africa. Although eastern, northern and southern Africa (with central and western being largely unknown) show similarities and ultimately the same evolutionary and behavioral outcome, they also exhibit independent trajectories that require further research to throw light on the processes involved.},

Using a methodology inspired from a community on the Taimyr Peninsula in northern Siberia, a network of post-procurement food distributions is explored to describe underlying patterns of stability. Four pathways for food sharing are identified, including kin and non-kin distributions that are both reciprocated and unreciprocated. These four pathways obtain even when considering differences in household hunting skill, differences in household hunting wealth, the sum costs of procurement, and documented reciprocation in non-food goods and services. The interplay between traditional ecological knowledge about sharing and access to resources and the observed sharing behavior is discussed. These findings illustrate the robustness of prosocial solutions to collective action problems surrounding food procurement and security in an indigenous Siberian community.},

 abstract = {Broken animal phalanges from archaeological sites have been widely used as an indicator of nutritional stress of the prehistoric people due to the low caloric return rate (caloric yield/processing time) of the phalanges. Although it sounds logical, this widely popular argument is based on Binford’s (1978) interview with the Nunamiut and lacks empirical support. In this study, we present the results of experimental studies conducted on 142 modern cow (Bos taurus) and deer (Odocoileus virginianus) first phalanges to document the processing of phalanges, such as the required force and processing time to break them open, possible methods of breaking phalanges, and the resultant breakage and surface modification patterns. This comparative dataset and ethnographic data from contemporary hunter-gatherer groups indicate that broken phalanges in and of themselves cannot be taken as evidence of resource stress. The phalanges do not require substantial amount of processing time and marrow from the phalanges could have been preferred for its taste and soft texture during the period when resources were not scarce. This may explain the bone breakage pattern from an 8800 year old archaeological assemblage from Tangzigou in southwest China, where phalanges were intensively broken without any other evidence of resource stress.},

 abstract = {Social density processes impact the activity and order of collective behaviours in a variety of biological systems. Much effort has been devoted to understanding how density of people affects collective human motion in the context of pedestrian flows. However, there is a distinct lack of empirical data investigating the effects of social density on human behaviour in cooperative contexts. Here, we examine the functioning and performance of human teams in a central-place foraging arena using high-resolution GPS data. We show that team functioning (level of coordination) is greatest at intermediate social densities, but contrary to our expectations, increased coordination at intermediate densities did not translate into improved collective foraging performance and foraging accuracy was equivalent across our density treatments. We suggest that this is likely a consequence of foragers relying upon visual channels (local information) to achieve coordination but relying upon auditory channels (global information) to maximise foraging returns. These findings provide new insights for the development of more sophisticated models of human collective behaviour that consider different networks for communication (e.g. visual and vocal) that have the potential to operate simultaneously in cooperative contexts.},

A 25 cm deep sub-level, named Aurora Stratum, contained a large number of human fossils, stone tools and faunal remains. The appearance of human remains as part of a butchered faunal assemblage in association with stone tools raises an interesting question relating to human behaviour. The main aim of this paper, therefore, is to evaluate the nature and function of the human occupation at this cave site with a view to understanding the purposes of cannibalism. The zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of the macrovertebrate remains focus on species composition, weight and anatomic groups, as well as breakage intensity, type of fragmentation, and surface damage (particularly tool-induced damage) in order to evaluate the faunal source, butchering techniques and economic strategies of the human groups involved. We also studied the distribution and fossil refitting at the site to establish depositional and postdepositional disturbance. Diagenetic breakage due to sediment compression plays an important role in the assemblage, but the most extensive modifications are those produced by human activity for nutritional purposes.},

@article{pub.1025319583,
 abstract = {Changes in the social morphology of hunter-gatherer groups during their annual nomadic cycle can be reduced to three categories : a group in residential short or long-term camps (nomadic or semi-sedentary) ; an aggregate of several residential groups ; and the division of a residential group. Each of these categories refers to the organization of the group according to rules and socioeconomic standards unchanged by the departure or arrival of mere individuals. The residential group is made up of domestic units also forming interconnected domestic groups. It is materialized in the residential camp. The aggregate brings together residential groups exploiting the same territory or nearby territories. The aggregate camp is a place in which social and religious intensity is revealed, thus signalling that the residential groups belong to the same regional band. The phenomenon of division occurs when an age – and often a gender – group leaves the residential camp in order to supply it. This change in the sociological composition of the whole residential group turns the residential camp into a base camp. This third category of socioeconomic organization is thus materialized in two forms : the logistic expedition camp(s) of those who leave and in parallel a base camp. We shall illustrate these categories through three examples : Ammassalimiuts (Greenland), Nunamiuts (Alaska) and Akas (central Africa). In order to gain an archaeological perception of this phenomenon, we have to start with its materialisation. We then encounter two levels of analysis : the first is that of the different categories of settlement patterns corresponding to the sociological change and the second is that of production and consumption activities carried out in those settlements. In order to pass from the first level to the second, the settlement categories are compared with the availability of natural resources. Scattered nomadic residential groups would indicate easy access to plentiful and diversified resources ; logistic expeditions would point to the difficult acquisition of scattered game ; and, finally, the aggregate would not necessarily correspond to the exploitation of a located and plentiful resource, but would often occur during times of supply difficulties. While our categories do not thus belong exclusively to the economic domain, a possibility of apprehending them in terms of availability and exploitation of resource types nevertheless emerges. The possibility of bringing out tendencies by adopting a type of settlement according to the distribution of resources highlights the economic role of these settlements. The remains of operational sequences (“ chaîne opératoire ”) in the acquisition, treatment, consumption, preservation or transport of the resources found on a site allow the complementary nature of their economic links with other sites to be felt. Without taphonomic disturbances on a wide scale, intrasite spatial analysis, the type of structure recorded as well as their association with the distribution of remains, provides information about the location of activities, the contemporaneousness of the structures, their nature and their number. The aggregate and residential sites should show evidence of the daily activities of production and consumption. For the aggregate site, artefacts emblematic of social or symbolic activities should be expected. A logistic expedition site materializes the acquisition of a specific resource and its transport ; the resource may sometimes have been treated in order to facilitate its transport. The operational sequence of the activity started on the spot will be incomplete and will occur without any other types of activity. The typological discrimination then slips from the sociologic to the economic field, more within the reach of archaeology. However, even when there are not any important natural taphonomical disruptions, the determination of functions according to the site can be hindered for two reasons : the way the artefacts have been accumulated may involve a mixing of settlement patterns, and the disappearance of remains can go as far as the obliteration of some settlement categories.
Les variations de morphologie sociale des groupes de chasseurs cueilleurs au cours de leur cycle annuel de nomadisme peuvent être ramenées à trois catégories : l’installation du groupe en campements résidentiels de courte ou de longue durée (mobiles ou semi-sédentaires), l’agrégation de plusieurs groupes résidentiels et la division du groupe résidentiel. Dans cet article, ces catégories sont présentées à travers trois exemples : les Ammassalimiuts, les Nunamiuts et les Akas (respectivement au Groenland, en Alaska et en Afrique centrale). Pour rendre archéologiquement perceptible ce phénomène, il nous faut partir de sa matérialisation. Nous rencontrons alors deux niveaux d’analyse : celui des catégories d’habitats correspondant aux variations sociologiques et celui des activités de production et de consommation réalisées au sein de ces habitats. La discrimination typologique glisse alors du domaine sociologique au champ économique plus aisément accessible pour l’archéologie. Cependant, même en l’absence d’importantes perturbations taphonomiques naturelles, l’attribution des fonctions aux sites peut souffrir de deux choses : un mode d’accumulation des dépôts entraînant un mélange de types d’installations et une disparition postdépositionnelle de vestiges allant jusqu’à l’effacement de certaines catégories d’installation.},

 abstract = {It has been repeatedly proposed that the human presence in Europe during the late Early and the early Middle Pleistocene was conditioned, among other factors, by the available trophic resources and by the competition with carnivores for these resources. Competition for meat with other secondary consumers could delay the human dispersal through Europe. Moreover, some research suggests that human settlement was discontinuous in Europe during the late Early and the Middle Pleistocene and that this discontinuity might be related to the presence of other secondary consumers. The competition intensity among secondary consumer species in Europe has been previously analysed at both local and continental scales. At the local scale, two faunal assemblages from the Sierra de Atapuerca sites were analysed, demonstrating that competition intensity was higher in the early Middle Pleistocene than in the late Early Pleistocene. At a continental scale, 34 faunal assemblages were analysed and demonstrated an opposite pattern. In the present study, we extended the local analysis to include more faunal assemblages from the Sierra de Atapuerca sites to track the changes in the competition intensity during a longer time period. The results show that humans were able to successfully exploit the Atapuerca ecosystems at different levels of competition intensity, and that TD6-2 assemblage exhibits an exceptionally low degree of competition. It is proposed that the TD6-2 paleocommunity likely included a large felid species that is not recorded in the fossil assemblage. Lack of human presence in the TD8 assemblage may be related to increased competition intensity inside the guild of secondary consumers, while the technological development from Mode 2 to Mode 3 could be related to an increased degree of competition. There are similarities between the analyses at the continental and local scales from the point of view of the available biomass for secondary consumers, but the competition intensity shows little variation at the local scale, with the exception of the TD6-2 assemblage.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a taphonomic analysis of the faunal assemblages from the 1993–1999 excavations at Ambrona (Spain), directed by Santonja and Pérez-González. The purpose of the new excavations was to achieve a better understanding of the stratigraphic sequence, general geology, sedimentary context and processes of accumulation of materials. Our objectives are to evaluate the opposing interpretations of the hominid subsistence activities at the site proposed by Freeman and Binford. The faunal and lithic remains are found in different sedimentary contexts: an alluvial fan, lacustrine muds, fluviatile clay–sands and channel deposits. Faunal remains in the lacustrine muds are often, but not always, in primary context. Remains of elephant and deer carcasses may be found in partial articulation or proximity and represent natural occurrences without any clear evidence of hominid intervention. In other contexts the faunal remains are occurrences of single anatomical elements either displaced by water or left isolated in situ. There are no carnivore marks; bones and stone artifacts show varying degrees of mechanical abrasion due to water transport. Limited evidence of human action on bones is provided by a few SEM verified cutmarks and some anthropic fractures. They document butchery of various animals, including elephants. We cannot prove hunting but we can definitely reject Binford's idea of marginal scavenging of medium-size ungulates from carnivore kills. Ambrona is a complex mix of natural and human components, the remnant of a natural landscape regularly visited by hominids, who transported some artifacts from nonlocal raw material sources and had an organized approach to meat acquisition. However, strong evidence of elephant hunting is provided only by sites younger than Ambrona.},

Within species, parts are ranked on a uni-dimensional scale for transport: high ranked parts are more likely to be moved from kill sites to base camps, low ranked parts less likely. For most species in the sample, rank order is inconsistent with that described in the widely cited White/Perkins and Daly model. Archaeological interpretations based on this aspect of the model are therefore suspect. The number of parts moved from Hadza kills varies with transport costs, measured by carcass size and/or kill site-base camp distance. This result fits predictions from the White/Perkins and Daly model. Further application of these results to archaeological problems requires that the Hadza pattern be explained in general terms. The potential relevance of a transport model recently formulated by Metcalfe is noted.},

 abstract = {How did humans sleep before the modern era? Because the tools to measure sleep under natural conditions were developed long after the invention of the electric devices suspected of delaying and reducing sleep, we investigated sleep in three preindustrial societies [1-3]. We find that all three show similar sleep organization, suggesting that they express core human sleep patterns, most likely characteristic of pre-modern era Homo sapiens. Sleep periods, the times from onset to offset, averaged 6.9-8.5 hr, with sleep durations of 5.7-7.1 hr, amounts near the low end of those industrial societies [4-7]. There was a difference of nearly 1 hr between summer and winter sleep. Daily variation in sleep duration was strongly linked to time of onset, rather than offset. None of these groups began sleep near sunset, onset occurring, on average, 3.3 hr after sunset. Awakening was usually before sunrise. The sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature, was not interrupted by extended periods of waking, and terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the nadir of daily ambient temperature. The daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep. Light exposure was maximal in the morning and greatly decreased at noon, indicating that all three groups seek shade at midday and that light activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is maximal in the morning. Napping occurred on <7% of days in winter and <22% of days in summer. Mimicking aspects of the natural environment might be effective in treating certain modern sleep disorders. },

 abstract = {Some of the models proposed to explain Plio-Pleistocene hominid behavior and the formation of early East African archaeological sites are based on the assumption that the riparian habitats in which most of them occur were places of low interspecific competition. Competition is expressed here in terms of carnivore and hominid interactions. In this paper, a study of carnivore interaction in open and closed habitats is presented. The results indicate that riparian woodland shows the lowest degree of competition in savanna ecosystems. This suggests that if Plio-Pleistocene carnivores were adapted like their modern counterparts, the paleoecological settings of early sites could have provided hominids with enough safety to process carcasses and behave as shown in "central-place", "near-kill location" and "refuge" foraging models.},

 abstract = {In contrast to the coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula, the Upper Palaeolithic settlement of central Iberia, dominated by the Spanish plateau, is poorly known. Traditional models assume a total or virtual depopulation of the interior of the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial. In this paper we present a detailed investigation of human-environment interactions through the first zooarchaeological, taphonomic and isotopic study of the key site of Peña Capón, a rock shelter located in the south-eastern foothills of the Central System range that contains a multi-layered deposit dated to marine isotope stage 2 (MIS 2). Analyses of the faunal assemblages of the Proto-Solutrean (3) and Middle Solutrean (2) layers show that human preferentially hunted horse, deer and iberian ibex living in the vicinity of the rock shelter. Isotope geochemistry of the animal remains of Peña Capón provides us with the first detailed intra-tooth multi-proxy analysis for this time period in south-western Europe, providing estimates of climatic conditions, seasonal flucturation of diet, as well as patterns of seasonal mobility. Our results indicate that human presence at Peña Capón was apparently restricted to relatively warm intervals around the LGM or reflects the presence of an ecological refuge, and provide us with evidence of recurrent human presence in the Iberian interior during the Upper Paleolithic prior to the Magdalenian.},

 abstract = {Abstract Although Idaho’s Snake River Plain contains a trans-Holocene record of bison exploitation, archaeologists have rarely investigated carcass butchery strategies in the region. We fill this knowledge gap with a study of bison remains from Baker Cave, a late Holocene processing site on the eastern Snake River Plain. We hypothesize that these remains resulted from fat-seeking behavior in response to winter fat scarcity. We explore this hypothesis with a series of variables designed to measure processing intensity: Impacts per Element, Percent Complete, and Number of Identified Specimens/Minimum Number of Elements. All three variables generate similarly strong correlations with skeletal fat utility, suggesting that Baker Cave’s inhabitants organized processing efforts around winter fat scarcity.

 abstract = {Cutmarks have played an important role in addressing whether our hominid ancestors were hunters or scavengers, describing ritual modification of human bone, defining the origin of metallurgy, and highlighting the diversity of prehistoric butchering behavior. The widespread occurrence of cutmarks on animal bones and their variability allows archaeologists to use this kind of evidence to address a broad range of questions. One goal in examining cutmark diversity is to identify diagnostic cutmarks of prehistoric butchering, processing, and consuming behaviors. Linking cutmarks to specific activities allows us to test fine-grained hypotheses concerning the nature of an archaeological site, and to do this a systematic method for addressing variability in both the appearance and anatomical position of cutmarks is essential. An analysis of caribou bones collected by Lewis Binford from the Palangana site in Alaska is used to build and test a diagnostic cutmark classification using their morphometric and spatial properties. This case study demonstrates that cutmarks can be used to simultaneously address large-scale anthropological questions and reveal intra-site behavioral variability in the archaeological record.},

Various theoretical models contrast immediate vs delayed consumption, or sharing vs storage, with the inference that these may be seen as mutually exclusive phenomena. A survey of cross-cultural evidence for sharing in the ethnographic literature indicates quite a range of variation in actual practice of food sharing among modern hunters and gatherers. While competing theories attribute this behaviour to ideological or ecological bases, most ideological models are very difficult to test in the archaeological record. The difficulty lies first in establishing that food sharing took place, as opposed to mere assertion that it did, and second in demonstrating linkages between perceived patterns in the archaeological record and explanatory models said to account for the practice.

 abstract = {Analysis of the faunal remains recovered from two penecontemporaneous Early Holocene archeological sites on the Clary Ranch in western Nebraska offers a series of functional insights on the organizational structure of Late Paleo-Indian subsistence behavior on the central Great Plains of North America. At each location, radiocarbon assays on charcoal and bone indicate occupation between 9100 and 9000BP. The deposits appear to represent functionally divergent, although complementary, dimensions of a single, spatially differentiated settlement and subsistence system situated along a intermittent tributary of the North Platte River. The Clary Ranch site provides a view from the perspective of a late summer–early fall secondary processing area for bison carcasses derived from a nearby mass kill. The intensive character of carcass exploitation here, involving defleshing and marrow extraction, suggests that the bulk of the yield was destined for storage in anticipation of impending winter food shortages. The primary component at the partially excavated, stratified O.V. Clary site is a residential camp, with evidence for occupation during the mid-summer, mid-winter, and late winter/early spring. On-site activities there are organized around an intact hearth area, to which the carcass parts from at least six bison were transported for processing and subsequent consumption. Non-bison remains recovered from the hearth area include coyote, box turtle, raven, great horned owl, and several small, indeterminate passerines},

 abstract = {Wildebeest drownings produce dense bone deposits over large surface areas adjacent to lakes and rivers in the Serengenti ecosystem of East Africa. Drownings occur during the annual wildebeest migration when animals cross rivers and lakes on their way to wet season pastures. Drownings involve both small and large numbers of adult and newborn wildebeest and can occur in a single event or a sequence of small and large events during the wet season.Signature criteria from surface skeletal remains produced by modern drownings that may, as an integrated set, help to identify them in the fossil record include: (1) the predominance of adults from a single species and the variable representation of newborns and yearlings; (2) the presence of intact elements from all adult skeletal groups; (3) assemblages dominated by axial elements and long bones; and (4) negative correlations between the representation of long bones and their marrow wet weights; assemblages from large drowning events possess weak negative correlations while small events possess strong negative correlations. The application of these criteria requires a landscape sampling strategy, because the drowning event's signature can be spread out over hundreds or thousands of metres of river or lake front. Consequently, localized samples from a large drowning may be affected differently by carnivores, flowing water, trampling, weathering, and/or burial and not possess all of these signature criteria.Drownings represent important scavenging opportunities for a wide variety of consumers because of the number of carcasses they can produce. Their occurrence in rivers and lakes also gives them some seasonal and spatial predictability. Under these circumstances, it is possible that water-restricted early hominids may have gained relatively early access to large animal carcasses without recourse to hunting or confrontational scavenging. Early access to carcasses would have been facilitated by the simultaneous presence of many drowned individuals over a large area, because these conditions act to reduce inter- and intra-specific competition for carcass foods among consumers. Later access to carcasses could still have provided hominids with a wealth of nutritious long bone marrow and cranial contents.},

 abstract = { Analyses of large open-air spaces on northern hunter–gatherer sites face many difficulties. A central concern is that open-air tasks such as large scale animal processing may leave behind little or no macro evidence. Many tasks did, however, introduce chemical residues into underlying soils. Chemical surveys of these soils offer a minimally invasive, sustainable means of investigating large open-air spaces, which can provide evidence for the structured use of such spaces. Defining structuring in the use of space, in turn, contributes to clarifying site functions, seasonality, and residential mobility. Exemplifying this approach, we present results from ongoing soil chemistry studies at a 2000year old Taltheilei hunter–gatherer encampment in the Canadian Arctic. Samples were analyzed using X-ray florescence spectroscopy (XRF), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Patterning in the data was highlighted using principal component analysis (PCA) and inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW). Anomalous concentrations of CaO, MnO, P2O5, and Cu were discovered adjacent to dwellings, representing hearth cleaning episodes. Along with these, enrichments in K2O, MgO, Fe2O3, Sr, Sc, Y, Cr, Ni, and Pb provide support for the presence of open-air animal processing facilities. We have also identified several peaks in our FTIR spectra that reasonably indicate trans-fat derived from ruminant tissue. At this stage of research, anomalies are attributed to caribou processing and refuse disposal during late fall occupations. While we are hopeful that FTIR will continue to develop as a valuable means of identifying fats in archaeological contexts, additional work will strengthen our current argument for the presence of trans-fats in our samples.},

 abstract = {The Genographic Project is an international effort aimed at charting human migratory history. The project is nonprofit and nonmedical, and, through its Legacy Fund, supports locally led efforts to preserve indigenous and traditional cultures. Although the first phase of the project was focused on uniparentally inherited markers on the Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the current phase focuses on markers from across the entire genome to obtain a more complete understanding of human genetic variation. Although many commercial arrays exist for genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, they were designed for medical genetic studies and contain medically related markers that are inappropriate for global population genetic studies. GenoChip, the Genographic Project's new genotyping array, was designed to resolve these issues and enable higher resolution research into outstanding questions in genetic anthropology. The GenoChip includes ancestry informative markers obtained for over 450 human populations, an ancient human (Saqqaq), and two archaic hominins (Neanderthal and Denisovan) and was designed to identify all known Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups. The chip was carefully vetted to avoid inclusion of medically relevant markers. To demonstrate its capabilities, we compared the FST distributions of GenoChip SNPs to those of two commercial arrays. Although all arrays yielded similarly shaped (inverse J) FST distributions, the GenoChip autosomal and X-chromosomal distributions had the highest mean FST, attesting to its ability to discern subpopulations. The chip performances are illustrated in a principal component analysis for 14 worldwide populations. In summary, the GenoChip is a dedicated genotyping platform for genetic anthropology. With an unprecedented number of approximately 12,000 Y-chromosomal and approximately 3,300 mtDNA SNPs and over 130,000 autosomal and X-chromosomal SNPs without any known health, medical, or phenotypic relevance, the GenoChip is a useful tool for genetic anthropology and population genetics.},

The theory of ‘morality as cooperation’ uses the mathematics of cooperation—the theory of nonzero-sum games—to identify the many distinct problems of cooperation and their solutions, and it predicts that it is the solutions employed by humans that constitute ‘morality’. Thus, morality turns out to be a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation and conflict recurrent in human social life. This theory generates a comprehensive taxonomy of moral values—a Periodic Table of Ethics—that includes obligations to family, group loyalty, reciprocity, bravery, respect, fairness, and property rights. And because morality as cooperation makes principled predictions about the structure and content of human morality, which can be tested against those of rival theories, it reveals that the study of morality is simply another branch of science.},

 abstract = {Introduction Modern humans emerged in Africa ~200 thousand years ago (kya), and expanded from an estimated census size of just over a million individuals (Hawks et al., 2000) during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) to ~7 billion inhabitants today (www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html). The long-term human effective population size (i.e. the number of breeding adults) is inferred to be ~10 000 individuals based on studies of variation in proteins (Haigh and Smith, 1972; Takahata, 1993), autosomal DNA (Erlich et al., 1996; Takahata, 1993; Tenesa, 2007), X chromosome DNA (Cox et al., 2008), Y-chromosome DNA (Takahata, 1993), and mitochondrial DNA (Takahata, 1993). After migrating from Africa within the past 50–100 kya, modern humans have successfully colonized most of the terrestrial parts of the globe. Genetic evidence indicates that human populations underwent several major population expansion and migration events over the last 100 kya (Atkinson et al., 2009; Cox et al., 2009; Excoffier and Schneider, 1999; Harpending et al., 1993; Rogers and Harpending, 1992). Patterns of mtDNA and nuclear genetic diversity indicate that there was an initial major population expansion in Africa ~110–70 kya (Atkinson et al., 2009; Excoffier and Schneider, 1999; Harpending et al., 1993; Rogers and Harpending, 1992) and subsequent migration and expansion events around the globe at periods ~60–55 kya, ~40–25 kya, and ~12 kya (Atkinson et al., 2009; Cox et al., 2009; Harpending et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2006). Modern humans evolved during a hyper arid period in Africa and might have been restricted to parts of Africa with favorable ecological conditions (Ambrose, 1998a; Hawks et al., 2000). Population expansions and migrations during the Pleistocene, followed by exponential expansion during the Holocene, were correlated with shifts in climatic conditions and technological innovation (Pennington, 1996; Powell et al., 2009). Migration has played an important role in shaping the pattern of genetic and cultural variation in African populations (Cox et al., 2008), which currently consist of >2000 diverse ethnolinguistic groups, representing ~30% of the linguistic diversity in the world (Haspelmath et al., 2008; Lewis, 2009). Here we summarize the paleoclimatic conditions, major cultural and linguistic shifts, and major migration events in Africa which have contributed to the current patterns of genetic variation in the continent.},

Students of hominid origins have used these findings in attempts at reconstructing the hominisation process. When doing so, however, it is important to remember that the function played by tool behavior in the chimpanzee subsistence pattern is still far from being well understood. Some 60 years ago, W. KOEHLER had already observed most or all of the behaviors later reported from East Africa. The comments he then made appear to be still valid today. Specifically, they recommend great prudence in interpreting the function of tool behavior in chimpanzees. The latter, he felt, may often be closer to play than to the performance of a task.KOEHLER's remarks also suggest the kind of observations needed in order to clarify the meaning of the tool behaviors reported from Africa. Should these observations confirm that object manipulation in chimpanzees always contains an important element of play, one would have to consider the possibility that toys may have been as important as tools as an index of the emergence of the capabilities responsible for human behavior.},

 abstract = {The phenomenon of equifinality complicates behavioral interpretations of faunal assemblages from contexts in which Pleistocene hominins are suspected bone accumulators. Stone tool butchery marks on ungulate fossils are diagnostic of hominin activities, but debate continues over the higher-order implications of butchered bones for the foraging capabilities of hominins. Additionally, tooth marks imparted on bones by hominins overlap in morphology and dimensions with those created by some non-hominin carnivores, further confounding our view of early hominins as meat-eating hunters, scavengers or both. We report on the manual/oral peeling of cortical layers of ungulate ribs as taphonomically diagnostic of hominoid/hominin meat- and bone-eating behavior that indicates access to large herbivore carcasses by hominins at the site of BK, Olduvai. Supporting these inferences, we show that certain types of rib peeling damage are very rare or completely unknown in faunas created by modern carnivores and African porcupines, but common in faunas modified by the butchery and/or consumption activities of modern humans and chimpanzees, during which these hominoids often grasp ribs with their hands, and then used their teeth to peel strips of cortex from raggedly chewed ends of the ribs. Carnivores consume ungulate ribcage tissues soon after kills, so diagnostic traces of hominin butchery/consumption on ribs (i.e., peeling and butchery marks) indicate early access to ungulate carcasses by BK hominins. Tooth marks associated with the peeling and butchery marks are probably hominin-derived, and may indicate that it was not uncommon for our ancestors to use their teeth to strip meat from and to consume portions of ribs. Recognition of rib peeling as a diagnostic signature of hominoid/hominin behavior may also aid the search for pre-archaeological traces of hominin meat-eating.},

 abstract = {Newly recorded archaeological sites at Gona (Afar, Ethiopia) preserve both stone tools and faunal remains. These sites have also yielded the largest sample of cutmarked bones known from the time interval 2.58-2.1 million years ago (Ma). Most of the cutmarks on the Gona fauna possess obvious macroscopic (e.g., deep V-shaped cross-sections) and microscopic (e.g., internal microstriations, Herzian cones, shoulder effects) features that allow us to identify them confidently as instances of stone tool-imparted damage caused by hominid butchery. In addition, preliminary observations of the anatomical placement of cutmarks on several of the recovered bone specimens suggest that Gona hominids may have eviscerated carcasses and defleshed the fully muscled upper and intermediate limb bones of ungulates--activities that further suggest that Late Pliocene hominids may have gained early access to large mammal carcasses. These observations support the hypothesis that the earliest stone artifacts functioned primarily as butchery tools and also imply that hunting and/or aggressive scavenging of large ungulate carcasses may have been part of the behavioral repertoire of hominids by c. 2.5 Ma, although a larger sample of cutmarked bone specimens is necessary to support the latter inference.},

 abstract = {Foraging is constrained by the energy within resources and the mechanics of acquisition and assimilation. Thick molar enamel, a character trait differentiating hominins from African apes, is predicted to mitigate the mechanical costs of chewing obdurate foods. The classic expression of hyperthick enamel together with relatively massive molars, termed megadontia, is most evident in Paranthropus, a lineage of hominins that lived about 2.7-1.2 million years ago. Among contemporary primates, thicker molar enamel corresponds with the consumption of stiffer, deformation-resistant foods, possibly because thicker enamel can better resist cracking under high compressive loads. Accordingly, plant underground storage organs (USOs) are thought to be a central food resource for hominins such as Paranthropus due to their abundance, isotopic composition, and mechanical properties. Here, we present a process-based model to investigate foraging constraints as a function of energetic demands and enamel wear among human ancestors. Our framework allows us to determine the fitness benefits of megadontia, and to explore under what conditions stiff foods such as USOs are predicted to be chosen as fallback, rather than preferred, resources. Our model predictions bring consilience to the noted disparity between functional interpretations of megadontia and microwear evidence, particularly with respect to Paranthropus boisei. },

 abstract = {Site GNL Quintero 1 (GNLQ1), located in Quintero Bay (32°S, Central Chile) constitutes the first evidence of a drowned terrestrial site on the continental West Coast of South America covered by sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum. The site currently lies 650 m offshore and 13 m underwater, covers an area of ∼64 m2 and contains several discrete exposed and shallow-buried bone deposits. Through underwater archaeology survey and test excavations, a significant amount of animal bone assigned to the Late Pleistocene was successfully recovered and analyzed. After recovery and prior to the analyses, the bones were subjected to conservation and stabilization treatments, resulting in good preservation of the material. Taxonomic analyses (NISP 224) revealed high taxonomic diversity of extinct fauna (Camelidae, Cervidae, Artiodactyla, Equidae, Mylodontidae, Canidae, Rodentia and Xenarthra). The sample represents a continental faunal assemblage belonging to a drowned terrestrial context, probably related to an estuarine-lagoon environment. Taphonomic analysis allowed macroscopic identification of natural marks (punctures) associated with large and small size carnivores. The bones also show abrasion related to the action of marine sands along with colour alterations. By applying Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs and Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) to fossil bones, marks and colour alterations were identified. Marks indicated rodent gnawing and trampling, while colour alterations were attributed to diagenesis processes, discarding thermal treatment. Site GNLQ1 is identified as having very high potential, for it provides the first evidence for a submerged palaeolandscape viable for human occupation and movement along the Pacific Coast of South America during the Late Pleistocene.},

 abstract = {The Lower Palaeolithic, epitomized by the Acheulean biface technology, is characterized by a degree of temporal and geographical stasis that is unparalleled in the lithic record. The reasons for this phenomenon have provoked considerable debate. However, whilst it is important to understand the overall stability of this techno complex, it is also important to address the considerable degree of variability evident at the level of individual locales. Why, for instance, do bifaces show a range of shapes and degrees of refinement? Why do some show high degrees of symmetry whilst others do not? Whilst it is widely acknowledged that such variability is the result of a number of factors, to date proposed theories tend to stress one factor as being of paramount importance. These have encompassed, amongst others, the influence of raw material, subsistence function, cognitive ability and the social context of manufacture upon biface form. This article, informed by recent empirical, experimental and theoretical work, attempts to move away from these largely single-factor models to present a multi-factorial model for biface variability. This model envisages that variability is caused by the differing motivations and constraints — ecological, physiological, biological, cognitive and social — which act upon the individual agent at any given point in time.},

 abstract = {We carried out a detailed taphonomic and zooarchaeological analysis of the faunal remains from the new excavation of the Late Natufian layers of el-Wad Terrace. We focused on gazelle exploitation patterns and examined them within the context of the established Epipalaeolithic sequence from the coastal plain of Israel. Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) is the most heavily exploited species. The taphonomic history of the assemblage suggests minor loss of bones caused by post-depositional processes and indicates that bone destruction occurred during occupation. Cut marks from all stages of activities, absence of selective transport, and body part representation suggest that gazelle were butchered at the site. Analysis of gazelle sex composition shows male overrepresentation during the Natufian. Size trends show an increase of gazelle body-size during the Natufian in comparison to previous periods. The patterns of body-size increase show the same tendency in proximal and distal limb-bones. The trends in gazelle body-size from the Epipalaeolithic of the coastal plain do not demonstrate any sign of morphological dwarfism, increased variation, or allometric changes in the morphology of Natufian gazelles and thus do not support the previously suggested hypothesis of “proto-domestication”.},

 abstract = {The reasons for megafaunal extinction in Australia have been hotly debated for over 30 years without any clear resolution. The proposed causes include human overkill, climate, anthropogenic induced habitat change or a combination of these. Most protagonists of the human overkill model suggest the impact was so swift, occurring within a few thousand years of human occupation of the continent, that archaeological evidence should be rare or non-existent. In Tasmania the presence of extinct megafauna has been known since the early twentieth century (Noetling, 1912; Scott, 1911, 1915) with earlier claims of human overlap being rejected because of poor chronology and equivocal stratigraphic associations. More recent archaeological research has not identified any megafauna from the earliest, exceptionally well-preserved late Pleistocene cultural sites. In 2008 however an argument for human induced megafaunal extinctions was proposed using the direct dates from a small sample of surface bone from two Tasmanian non-human caves and a museum sediment sample from an unknown location in a cave, since destroyed by quarrying (Turney et al., 2008). Turney et al. (2008) supplemented their data with published dates from other Tasmanian caves and open sites to argue for the survival of at least seven megafauna species from the last interglacial to the subsequent glacial stage.To investigate the timing of extinctions in Tasmania and examine the latest claims, new excavations and systematic surveys of limestone caves in south central Tasmania were undertaken. Our project failed to show any clear archaeological overlap of humans and megafauna but demonstrated that vigilance is needed when claiming survival of megafauna species based on old or suspect chronologies.The results of our six-years of fieldwork and dating form the first part of the present paper while, in the second part we assess the data advanced by Turney et al. (2008) for the late survival of seven megafauna species. A model of human prey selection and the reasons for the demise of a range of marsupials, now extinct, are discussed in the third part of the paper.},

 abstract = { Resilience theory provides a critical framework for examining the capacity of human societies to respond to changes to essential features of the human–environment relationship. Studies employing the long-term perspective required to understand adaptive cycles of resilience are still rare. Despite the challenges of working with variably preserved materials and small sample sizes, archaeological remains provide access to longitudinal data. One way of approaching human resilience is through its impacts on human well-being, which is often measured via population health. Population health is typically described by child mortality and morbidity rates. Here, we argue that the specific use of permanent biological markers of developmental stress (fluctuating dental asymmetry and dental enamel hypoplasia) serve as a proxy for prehistoric population health. A case study from Japan is used to test this proposal. We focus on persistent hunter–gatherer populations before and after the introduction of agriculture to the region. Too frequently the focus of research in periods of agricultural transition favors those populations making the transition to agriculture, dismissing persistent hunter–gatherers as on the ecological margins. Archaeological data from prehistoric NW Kyushu indicate the persistence of a culturally autonomous hunter–gatherer Jōmon population for several centuries into the agricultural Yayoi period. Did these populations suffer from a decline in population health as might be expected if they were, in fact, reduced to the margins of the social-ecological system? Using dental markers of developmental stress from six persistent hunter–gatherer sites in NW Kyushu, we tested the hypothesis that hunter–gatherer developmental stress loads did not change over time. There were no statistically significant differences in developmental stress between pre-agricultural hunter–gatherers and persistent hunter–gatherer during the agricultural period. We interpret the results as evidence of resilience of these persistent hunter–gatherers in spite of major disruptions from immigrant agricultural populations to the social and ecological environments of NW Kyushu. Developmental stress in an archaeological context may serve as a useful proxy of resilience of past populations and future studies might take additional indicators of health into consideration.},

 abstract = {Social-welfare policies are a modern instantiation of a phenomenon that has pervaded human evolutionary history: resource sharing. Ancestrally, food was a key shared resource in situations of temporary hunger. If evolved human psychology continues to shape how individuals think about current, evolutionarily novel conditions, this invites the prediction that attitudes regarding welfare politics are influenced by short-term fluctuations in hunger. Using blood glucose levels as a physiological indicator of hunger, we tested this prediction in a study in which participants were randomly assigned to conditions in which they consumed soft drinks containing either carbohydrates or an artificial sweetener. Analyses showed that participants with experimentally induced low blood glucose levels expressed stronger support for social welfare. Using an incentivized measure of actual sharing behavior (the dictator game), we further demonstrated that this increased support for social welfare does not translate into genuinely increased sharing motivations. Rather, we suggest that it is "cheap talk" aimed at increasing the sharing efforts of other individuals. },

 abstract = {Livestock manure is often subjected to aerobic composting but little is known about the variation in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the composting process under different concentrations of antibiotics. This study compared the effects of three concentrations of oxytetracycline (OTC; 10, 60, and 200mg/kg) on ARGs and the succession of the bacterial community during composting. Very similar trends were observed in the relative abundances (RAs) of each ARG among the OTC treatments and the control during composting. After composting, the RAs of tetC, tetX, sul1, sul2, and intI1 increased 2-43 times, whereas those of tetQ, tetM, and tetW declined by 44-99%. OTC addition significantly increased the absolute abundances and RAs of tetC and intI1, while 200mg/kg OTC also enhanced those of tetM, tetQ, and drfA7. The bacterial community could be grouped according to the composting time under different treatments. The highest concentration of OTC had a more persistent effect on the bacterial community. In the present study, the succession of the bacterial community appeared to have a greater influence on the variation of ARGs during composting than the presence of antibiotics. Aerobic composting was not effective in reducing most of the ARGs, and thus the compost product should be considered as an important reservoir for ARGs.},

 abstract = {In the past twenty years, skeletal part profiles, which are prone to equifinality, have not occupied a prominent role in the interpretation of early Pleistocene sites on Africa. Alternatively, taphonomic studies on bone surface modifications and bone breakage patterns, have provided heuristic interpretations of some of the best preserved archaeological record of this period; namely, the Olduvai Bed I sites. The most recent and comprehensive taphonomic study of these sites (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2007a) showed that FLK Zinj was an anthropogenic assemblage in which hominins acquired carcasses via primary access. That study also showed that the other sites were palimpsests with minimal or no intervention by hominins. The FLK N, FLK NN and DK sequence seemed to be dominated by single-agent (mostly, felid) or multiple-agent (mostly, felid-hyenid) processes. The present study re-analyzes the Bed I sites focusing on skeletal part profiles. Machine learning methods, which incorporate complex algorithms, are powerful predictive and classification methods and have the potential to better extract information from skeletal part representation than past approaches. Here, multiple algorithms (via decision trees, neural networks, random forests and support vector machines) are combined to produce a solid interpretation of bone accumulation agency at the Olduvai Bed I sites. This new approach virtually coincides with previous taphonomic interpretations on a site by site basis and shows that felids were dominant accumulating agents over hyenas during Bed I times. The recent discovery of possibly a modern lion-accumulated assemblage at Olduvai Gorge (Arriaza et al., submitted) provides a very timely analog for this interpretation.},

In the past decade, the biological relevance of the microbiota for human health has become very apparent. The interest generated has led to an explosion of research in the field but some of the progress has been impeded by some conflicting and inconclusive results. In this chapter, we attempt to convey both the intriguing potential of microbiota research and some challenges currently facing research in the area. We discuss the different techniques available for studying the microbiota, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. We emphasize the importance of standardizing methods and analyses between centers, to distinguish true variation of the microbiota in unhealthy individuals from normal interpersonal variation. We report on recent literature describing the effect of diet and lifestyle on the microbiota and evaluate the potential role of the microbiota in a range of intestinal disorders. Attempts to manipulate the microbiota are detailed, such as administration of specific bacteria as probiotics, and wide‐ranging perturbations of the microbiota by fecal transplantation.},

 abstract = {In recent decades, many research questions focus on occupational patterns in the Middle Palaeolithic. Many discussions on that topic address the temporal resolution of formation of assemblages and the character of palimpsests that can be frequently observed at archaeological sites. The Abric Romaní site (Barcelona, Spain) is a good example to analyze questions related to temporal resolution of the human occupations. This site is filled by a succession of travertine platforms of rapid formation, which clearly separate different archaeological levels. With the objective of characterizing the settlement patterns developed at this site, a combination of zooarchaeological and spatial data from Level J (sublevels Ja and Jb) is presented here. On one hand, primary and immediate anthropogenic accesses to the carcasses (mainly horses and red deer) and well-established patterns of animal processing are observed. On the other hand, these activities are always developed around hearths of inhabitable areas. From a nutritional perspective, faunal refits suggest synchronic relationships between the different activity areas and, therefore, the anthropic occupation of the total surface of the rock-shelter during the formation of Level J. However, this certain synchrony is combined with the presence of other elements, such as overlapped hearths, which show a succession of several occupations with the same settlement patterns. In this way, Level J of Abric Romaní could be understood as the succession of several occupations formed by groups that maintained the same traditions through time. From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to improve data to understand the settlement patterns and the social organization systems of the Neanderthal groups during MIS 3.},

Here we refer to the movements we make within the confines of our homes or places of employment. With respect to nomadic peoples, movements at this scale would include movements within campsites. Understanding mobility at small scales is important to archeology because small-scale mobility decisions are a critical factor affecting spatial patterning observed in archeological sites. In this paper, we examine the factors affecting small-scale mobility decisions in a Mongolian reindeer herder summer camp and the implications of those decisions with regard to archeological spatial patterning. },

 abstract = {Proportions of skeletal elements from diverse taxa at some of the earliest Plio-Pleistocene archaeological sites at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and Koobi Fora, Kenya, provide a useful basis for inferring aspects of the subsistence behavior of ancient hominids. Provided that non-hominid agents affecting the accumulation, modification, and preservation of bones at the sites, including transport and gnawing by carnivores, flowing water, trampling by large animals, and differential burial, can be identified and factored out, skeletal patterning referable to hominid behavior can measure the timing of access to carcasses and the degree of transport of parts of carcasses away from death sites of prey animals to other favored localities. Skeletal patterning at the major sites at Olduvai and Koobi Fora that have been called living floors, home bases, or central place foraging sites, including FLKN levels 1–2, FLK Zinjanthropus, and several smaller sites, indicates hominid access to and transport of predominantly meat and marrow yielding limb elements of the carcasses of prey animals. Along with more direct evidence of hominid involvement with carcasses, in the form of artifact-induced cut marks and fractures on meat- and marrow-rich bones, these findings indicate that some ancient hominids obtained carcasses of prey animals soon after the animals died and transported selected parts yielding quantities of meat and marrow to favored localities for further processing and consumption.},

 abstract = {Honey is increasingly recognized as an important food item in human evolution, but it remains unclear whether extinct hominins could have overcome the formidable collective stinging defenses of honey bees during honey acquisition. The utility of smoke for this purpose is widely recognized, but little research has explored alternative methods of sting deterrence such as the use of plant secondary compounds. To consider whether hominins could have used plant extracts as a precursor or alternative to smoke, we review the ethnographic, ethnobotanical, and plant chemical ecology literature to examine how humans use plants in combination with, and independently of, smoke during honey collection. Plant secondary compounds are diverse in their physiological and behavioral effects on bees and differ fundamentally from those of smoke. Plants containing these chemicals are widespread and prove to be remarkably effective in facilitating honey collection by honey hunters and beekeepers worldwide. While smoke may be superior as a deterrent to bees, plant extracts represent a plausible precursor or alternative to the use of smoke during honey collection by hominins. Smoke is a sufficient but not necessary condition for acquiring honey in amounts exceeding those typically obtained by chimpanzees, suggesting that significant honey consumption could have predated the control of fire. },

Within-population diversity (ascertained through various parameters) and mean pairwise differences declined from east to west, in a pattern compatible with ancient population migration and expansion from the Middle East. Estimated expansion times indicate a Paleolithic event with important differences among populations according to their geographical position and thus a slower tempo than previously believed. The replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans, fully compatible with the present results, may have been a slower and more complex process than cultural change suggests.},

 abstract = {Published and unpublished skeletal and surface mark data from the large, well-preserved, bovid dominated FLK 22 (Zinjanthropus) archaeofauna are analyzed using data derived from four different experimental control samples. The control samples are realistic because they are based on natural history and paleoecological data collected from FLK 22, and other Olduvai Gorge assemblages; they are precise because independent experimental studies following the same methods have generated the same results; and they restore generality to the study of site formation because each one models a different hominid and/or carnivore scenario of site formation. Comparability between FLK 22 and the control samples is established by excluding specimens from the former which do not meet identification and reporting standards derived from the latter. As in two previous studies, a comprehensive analysis of tooth marks and tool marks on long bone specimens from FLK 22 indicates that they were processed in three stages. In stage one, carnivores defleshed long bones, as inferred from the high percentage of tooth marks on midshaft fragments. In stage two, hominids processed intact long bones for marrow, as inferred from percussion mark percentages. Cut marks suggest that long bones retained flesh, but the amount, as yet, cannot be determined using cut mark percentages. In stage three, carnivores processed long bone epiphyses for grease, as inferred from the under-representation of long bone epiphyses and the high percentage of tooth marks on near-epiphyses and surviving epiphyses. The lack of comprehensive skeletal and surface mark data on cranial, axial, compact, and other specimens currently limits the application of experimental results. However, the available data suggest that the condition and representation of these items in the FLK 22 assemblage are also consistent with a carnivore to hominid to carnivore sequence of site formation. The variety of elements present, and their extensive processing by hominids, indicates that FLK 22 functioned as a central place/refuge where hominids could transport a variety of carcass parts and process them in an unhurried fashion. The presence of numerous small and medium sized individuals also indicates that hominids could have passively scavenged carcasses from a number of different sources including lions, leopards, sabertooth cats, and mass drownings.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a standardized series of replicable and comparable density assays, based on the technique of photon densitometry (or absorptiometry), for two native South American camelid taxa, the domesticated llama (Lama glama) and alpaca (L. pacos). Two sets of volume density (VD) measures (in g/cm3) are provided: (1) “shape-adjusted” volume density (VDSA) which computes cross-sectional area of each scan site based upon computerized analysis of scanned digital images; and (2) standard volume density (VDLD/BT) which norms cross-sectional area to a block form. Derived value sets are compared with each other, between camelid specimens and with published figures for camelid, deer and bison skeletal elements. Patterns of structural bone densities between South American camelids and other artiodactyls might be attributed to unique anatomical expressions of locomotor and dietary adaptations. The density data are combined with derived meat utility indices to explore the archaeological correlates associated with the production, distribution and consumption of ch'arki, a native Andean dried meat product. The paper examines the validity of an Andeancharqui effect (sensu Miller, 1979, An introduction to the ethnoarchaeology of the Andean Camelids. Ph.D. Thesis, University of California at Berkeley), based on the well-known schlepp effect, by comparing hypotheticalch'arki and chalona models of meat preservation. Faunal data from the prehistoric Peruvian site of Chavı́n de Huántar do not support the consumption of imported ch'arki, but could implicate its local production. The data could also support the consumption of imported chalona, or the importation of live camelids which were subsequently slaughtered, locally produced into chalona and consumed. In both cases, the data leave open the possibility that Chavı́n may have been a production centre for either ch'arki or chalona; however, acceptance of the differing interpretations requires some potentially problematic assumptions.},

 abstract = {Admixed populations can make an important contribution to the discovery of disease susceptibility genes if the parental populations exhibit substantial variation in susceptibility. Admixture mapping has been used successfully, but is not designed to cope with populations that have more than two or three ancestral populations. The inference of admixture proportions and local ancestry and the imputation of missing genotypes in admixed populations are crucial in both understanding variation in disease and identifying novel disease loci. These inferences make use of reference populations, and accuracy depends on the choice of ancestral populations. Using an insufficient or inaccurate ancestral panel can result in erroneously inferred ancestry and affect the detection power of GWAS and meta-analysis when using imputation. Current algorithms are inadequate for multi-way admixed populations. To address these challenges we developed PROXYANC, an approach to select the best proxy ancestral populations. From the simulation of a multi-way admixed population we demonstrate the capability and accuracy of PROXYANC and illustrate the importance of the choice of ancestry in both estimating admixture proportions and imputing missing genotypes. We applied this approach to a complex, uniquely admixed South African population. Using genome-wide SNP data from over 764 individuals, we accurately estimate the genetic contributions from the best ancestral populations: isiXhosa [Formula: see text], ‡Khomani SAN [Formula: see text], European [Formula: see text], Indian [Formula: see text], and Chinese [Formula: see text]. We also demonstrate that the ancestral allele frequency differences correlate with increased linkage disequilibrium in the South African population, which originates from admixture events rather than population bottlenecks.
NOMENCLATURE: The collective term for people of mixed ancestry in southern Africa is "Coloured," and this is officially recognized in South Africa as a census term, and for self-classification. Whilst we acknowledge that some cultures may use this term in a derogatory manner, these connotations are not present in South Africa, and are certainly not intended here.},

 abstract = {Skeletal element representation at archaeological and palaeontological sites often differs from natural anatomical proportions. At archaeological sites this pattern could result from hominid behaviour, predepositional destructive or dispersive forces (such as carnivore ravaging), or post-depositional destructive forces (such as sediment compaction and leaching). Predepositional ravaging by carnivores is documented at several important Plio-Pleistocene archaeofaunal assemblages (FLK Zinjanthropus and FLKN levels 1–2). Here we present the first systematic and controlled experimental data on the effect of this process on skeletal element survival. Simulated archaeological assemblages of defleshed hammerstone-broken and unbroken bones were created within a captive spotted hyaena enclosure, and controlled numbers of hyaenas were allowed to ravage the sites. Vertebrae and pelves were nearly always chosen first for consumption by the hyaenas. Vertebrae and ribs were nearly always destroyed completely and pelves were destroyed 50% of the time. Limb-bone ends were frequently destroyed, while limb middle shaft fragments preserve nearly 100% of the original number of elements. Thus, hominid discarded bone assemblages, regardless of the original representation of elements, can come to resemble the schlepp effect simply through post-hominid hyaena scavenging. The documented pattern at FLK Zinjanthropus and FLKN1–2 of low frequencies of vertebrae, ribs and pelves and high frequencies of limbs may be due to post-hominid ravaging by hyaenas and not selective hominid transport of limb elements to the sites.},

 abstract = { Mallee is an endemic Australian woodland and shrubland of semi-arid, summer–dry regions between dry woodland and desert shrubland. In other parts of the world, such as Africa and the Americas, such climatic regions support grassland ecosystems. Using Australian and African climofunctions and models gives very different reconstructions of paleoclimate (subhumid versus perhumid) and paleovegetation (woodland versus rainforest) for North American fossil mammal faunas before Cenozoic evolution of grassland ecosystems. Modern mammal faunas of Africa and Australia have different ecological spectra of taxonomic units, body size, feeding, and locomotion of species of mammals on precipitation gradients. Gradients in proportions of such categories yield transfer functions for mean annual precipitation from percent species of Artiodactyla or Macropodidae, percent species of moderately large animals (45–180kg), percent species of arboreal mammals, and percent species of grazers. These transfer functions can be applied to fossil mammal faunas to estimate paleoprecipitation in Africa, Australia and North America. Modern transfer functions match well paleoprecipitation estimates based on depth to calcic horizons in paleosols at the same localities in Kenya and inland Australia back through the Miocene. For fossil mammal faunas of the Rocky Mountain region of North America, African transfer functions fail, but Australian transfer functions predict paleoprecipitation back to the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (66Ma). Furthermore, modern mallee soils investigated in this study closely match Cretaceous to Eocene paleosols of the Rocky Mountains. Extinct mallee-like vegetation, such as pori woodlands of Kenya and cunhaka woodlands (newly defined) of the Rocky Mountains better explains the dominance of small, nocturnal, insectivorous, arboreal mammals of Paleogene and Mesozoic mammal faunas, than comparisons with African grassland or rainforest faunas.},

However, the results in the literature are equivocal. One reason may be that most research has been performed in populations exposed to relatively low levels of parasitism. This article studies associations between the degree of masculinity/femininity and the fluctuating asymmetry (a measure of developmental instability) of skulls of three primate species [baboon (Papio anubis), eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)] collected in the wild. The exposure to infection and parasites is likely to be higher in these individuals compared to captive primates and humans, and therefore likely to increase the levels of association. While the degree of individual masculinity/femininity and levels of fluctuating asymmetry were quantified accurately, I found no evidence of an association between them. My results thus are in line with the conclusion of a recent meta-analysis, that there is little evidence for associations between masculinity/femininity and developmental instability.},

A baseline comparison across extant nonhuman primates reveals that they all depend on C 3 plants in forests, forest patches, and woodlands except during rare seasonal intake, in marginal regions, or where maize fields exist. Even large-bodied hominoids that could theoretically rely on hard-to-digest C 4 plants do not do so. Some Plio-Pleistocene hominins, however, apparently relied heavily on C 4 and/or CAM plants, which suggests that they relied extensively on cecal-colon microbial fermentation. Neanderthals seem less carnivorous than is often assumed when we compare their δ 15 N bone collagen values with those of recent human populations, including recent human foragers who also fall at or near the top of their local trophic system. Finally, the introduction of maize into North America is shown to have been more sporadic and temporally variable than previously assumed. },

Taxonomic data corroborate previous studies, that hominins primarily hunted Equus mosbachensis, a large Pleistocene horse. Equid body part representation at the site suggests that the animals were hunted and butchered locally. There is no evidence for density-mediated attrition in the assemblage. Weathering damage is uncommon, though there is ample evidence that carnivores had access to the bone. Carnivore bite sizes were measured and compared to experimental data provided by previous authors. Based on relationships between bite size and carnivore behavior and body size, we conclude that the primary modifying agents were large carnivores (i.e., wolves or saber-toothed cats). Previous studies show that carnivores often had secondary access to the remains, after hominins. Cut marks are commonly arranged haphazardly on the bones. This may indicate that multiple hominins participated in the butchery of horse skeletons, or that they were butchered over the course of hours or days. Cut marks on axial elements are more "orderly," which probably reflects the physical logistics of orienting one's body in relation to a large carcass. These data differ from sites formed by Middle and Upper Paleolithic hominins, which might suggest that in later times, a system of organized meat provisioning was already in place. Taken together, the faunal evidence from the Spear Horizon South indicates that late Lower Paleolithic hominins using the site understood the behaviors of different prey species, hunted socially to take down large game, and successfully competed with large carnivores on the landscape for primary access to ungulate remains.},

However, this area receives limited attention in archaeological debate, especially in early prehistory. We here consider N eanderthal childhood, exploring the experience of N eanderthal children using biological, cultural and social evidence. We conclude that N eanderthal childhood experience was subtly different from that of their modern human counterparts, orientated around a greater focus on social relationships within their group. Neanderthal children, as reflected in the burial record, may have played a particularly significant role in their society, especially in the domain of symbolic expression. A consideration of childhood informs broader debates surrounding the subtle differences between N eanderthals and modern humans. },

Research in this field is interdisciplinary, incorporating findings from anthropology, paleogenetics, and human ecology but with a remit that extends beyond the primarily biological focus of paleodemography. Important questions addressed by archaeological demography include the establishment of methods for inferring past population structure, the timing of the emergence of modern human demographic systems, the relative importance of attritional and catastrophic patterns of mortality, and the search for adaptive explanations for demographic transitions, colonization events, and population extinctions. Archaeological evidence, including the extent of settlements and site catchment areas as well as measures of the exploitation, consumption, and discard of materials and artifacts, have traditionally been used as proxies for estimating past population size and density. In recent years this evidence has been supplemented by increasingly large data sets compiled from radiocarbon dating programs. These data sets have been used to investigate demographic waves of advance during continental-scale periods of colonization and cultural change and to detect episodes of population decline, extinction, and hiatuses in settlement history. By considering studies of human genetic diversity that indicate temporary but drastic reductions in effective population size, I hypothesize that catastrophic mortality may have had an important role in long-term population processes and may have limited long-term rates of growth, particularly in prehistoric populations.},

                  From excavation at FLK North levels 1–2 in 1960–1962, Mary Leakey reported approximately 1200 Oldowan artifacts and 3300 large mammal fossils as a hominin “living floor”. Preliminary taphonomic analysis by Bunn seemed supportive, based on the presence of some cut-marked bones, the concentration of several dozen bovid individuals, and the relative abundance of limbs and mandibles over other axial elements. Recent taphonomic analysis of Leakey's entire fossil assemblage by Domínguez-Rodrigo and Barba, however, documents a minor hominin role at the site, contrasted to the dominant role of carnivores. Felids brought prey animals; hyenas scavenged from abandoned felid meals. At different times, hominins butchered several bovids and discarded artifacts at this dynamic location. Since 2006, renewed excavations at FLK North and other sites by the Olduvai Paleoanthropology and Paleoecology Project (TOPPP) have expanded artifact and fossil samples and implemented new analytical approaches to clarify taphonomic histories of the Olduvai paleolandscape. At FLK North, > 1000 new large mammal fossils from levels 1 to 2 show minimal butchery evidence amid abundant evidence of carnivore gnawing/fracture, rodent gnawing, and sediment abrasion. To help guide future excavation and analyses, we have developed several alternative working hypotheses of site formation.},

 abstract = {The human hand is unparalleled amongst primates in its ability to manipulate objects forcefully and dexterously. Previous research has predominantly sought to explain the evolution of these capabilities through an adaptive relationship between more modern human-like anatomical features in the upper limb and increased stone tool production and use proficiency. To date, however, we know little about the influence that other manipulatively demanding behaviors may have had upon the evolution of the human hand. The present study addresses one aspect of this deficiency by examining the recruitment of the distal phalanges during a range of manual transportation (i.e., carrying) events related to hominin behavioral repertoires during the Plio-Pleistocene. Specifically, forces on the volar pad of each digit are recorded during the transportation of stones and wooden branches that vary in weight and size. Results indicate that in most instances, the index and middle fingers are recruited to a significantly greater extent than the other three digits during carrying events. Relative force differences between digits were, however, dependent upon the size and weight of the object transported. Carrying behaviors therefore appear unlikely to have contributed to the evolution of the robust thumb anatomy observed in the human hand. Rather, results suggest that the manual transportation of objects may plausibly have influenced the evolution of the human gripping capabilities and the 3rd metacarpal styloid process.},

 abstract = {As part of our investigations into the potential of the Republic of Georgia for providing information on early hominin occupation of Eurasia, we report here on Akhalkalaki, a large late Early Pleistocene locality located along the lower slopes of a Miocene andesitic cone. Originally excavated in the 1950s as a palaeontological site, it was re-opened in the 1990s and stone tools were found associated with the fauna, suggesting that it is also an archaeological occurrence. Excavations in the 1950s and 1990s uncovered thousands of bones of an early Galerian fauna, including the remains of new species of Hippopotamus,Equus , and Canis (Vekua, 1962, 1987) and dominated by the remains of Equus süssenbornensis. We present the stratigraphy of the site, which together with faunal correlations and reversed paleomagnetics indicates an age most likely in the late Matuyama Chron, probably between 980,000 and 780,000 years ago. Taphonomic analysis suggests that the fauna was deposited and buried over a short time period, and was heavily modified by carnivores, but we cannot demonstrate involvement by hominins. Based on evidence of abundant krotovina (animal burrows filled with sediment) and the lack of definitive evidence for hominin modification to the bones, the stone tools at the site may have been mixed in with the older fauna. The taphonomic characteristics of the Akhalkalaki bone assemblage are not readily explained with reference to assemblage formation processes developed with actualistic studies that have been mostly conducted in Africa, including carnivore dens, predator arenas, human hunting and scavenging, mass deaths, or attritional bone deposition. Because of extreme anthropogenic modification of the present environments, the temperate setting, and the presence of mainly extinct taxa, local models based on actualistic studies cannot approximate the mammalian ecology reflected in the Akhalkalaki bone assemblage. A few comparisons are made with preliminary taphonomic observations from Dmanisi, an Early Pleistocene Homo ergaster site not far away.},

 abstract = {Underground storage organs (USOs) have been proposed as critical fallback foods for early hominins in savanna, but there has been little discussion as to which habitats would have been important sources of USOs. USOs consumed by hominins could have included both underwater and underground storage organs, i.e., from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Shallow aquatic habitats tend to offer high plant growth rates, high USO densities, and relatively continuous USO availability throughout the year. Baboons in the Okavango delta use aquatic USOs as a fallback food, and aquatic or semiaquatic USOs support high-density human populations in various parts of the world. As expected given fossilization requisites, the African early- to mid-Pleistocene shows an association of Homo and Paranthropus fossils with shallow-water and flooded habitats where high densities of plant-bearing USOs are likely to have occurred. Given that early hominins in the tropics lived in relatively dry habitats, while others occupied temperate latitudes, ripe, fleshy fruits of the type preferred by African apes would not normally have been available year round. We therefore suggest that water-associated USOs were likely to have been key fallback foods, and that dry-season access to aquatic habitats would have been an important predictor of hominin home range quality. This study differs from traditional savanna chimpanzee models of hominin origins by proposing that access to aquatic habitats was a necessary condition for adaptation to savanna habitats. It also raises the possibility that harvesting efficiency in shallow water promoted adaptations for habitual bipedality in early hominins.},

All these variables affect the resulting cut mark frequencies reported in archaeological sites. A large sample of archaeofaunal assemblages has been used for this study. It was concluded that the best estimator of cut mark frequency in any given assemblage is the percentage of cut-marked long bone specimens (probably due to its better preservation than other anatomical areas), which is determined by fragmentation and carnivore ravaging. Carcass size and tool type also play a major role in differences in cut mark frequencies. Fragmentation is also a key variable determining the abundance of cut-marked specimens. It is argued that general cut mark percentages are of limited value, given the number of variables that determine them, and that a more heuristic approach involves quantifying cut marks in a qualitative manner.},

Though comtemporary tribal men cannot be equated with prehistoric men, they resemble them more than do modernized men. Therefore the study of tribal peoples not only widens the range of circumstances in which human adaptability is observed, it throws some light on the evolution of human diseases. This is particularly the case with regard to the study of 'diseases of modern life'. Tribal life is characterized by comparative physical and cultural isolation, simplicity, small group size, low population density and closeness to nature, both physically and conceptually. In spite of rapid change, which itself needs study, there are still situations where what is studied has shown little recent change. In a world where dissatisfaction with life and medicine grows in spite of unparalleled technical success, we should look again at tribal men.

 abstract = {The majority of published human mitochondrial DNA sequence data are confined to hypervariable region I in the control region. By contrast, this paper focuses on a nucleotide site in hypervariable region II. Unlike most non-European populations whose mtDNA sequences have been studied in the literature, the British 'white Caucasian' population has a high level of variation at site 73 (following the site numbering by Anderson et al. 1981). This variation appears to have its origin largely in a mutation from guanine to adenine at that site with an estimated minimum age between 15,000 and 25,000 years. The data of Piercy et al. (1993) suggest that roughly half of the British 'white Caucasian' mitochondrial gene pool is descended from a common maternal ancestor who carried this mutation at site 73. This site also plays a central role in distinguishing the five major European mtDNA clusters identified in Richards et al. (1996). We suggest that the lineages carrying an A at site 73, together with some other lineages, may have their origins in a small founder population which expanded after the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. We conclude that, in addition to region I sequences, site 73 is worth determining in studies of Caucasian populations.},

 abstract = {Hominization via predation has become a pervasive anthropological theme in recent years. Indeed, the assumption that hunting behavior originated within the primate phylogenetic sequence as a “human” subsistence pattern has generated numerous subsidiary hypotheses about how secondary traits were initiated, propagated or enhanced when a terrestrial, savanna-dwelling, meat-eating hominid line emerged from an arboreal, forest-dwelling, plant-eating ancestral stock. New field evidence on the behavioral and organizational features of subsistence in nonhuman and human primates now provides the basis for reconsidering these views.Many monkey, ape and human populations no longer seem to fit the stereotyped images sketched in past decades, when little or no comparative information was available to anthropologists. The discrepancy between the old concepts and new facts is particularly evident in Sub-Saharan Africa, where numerous primate taxa have been studied in climatically and biotically similar zones. In this region alone, more than 364 cases of predation, involving 22 different species of mammalian prey, have been recorded among at least 10 supposedly “vegetarian” baboon and chimpanzee populations dispersed between Ethiopia and South Africa. Furthermore, many of the human populations living within this same region—such as the Mbuti pygmies, the Hadza and the Kalahari bushmen—have been characterized as “hunters” but actually subsist for the most part on foods other than meat. These basic facts about collector-predator and Gatherer-hunter subsistence patterns are a mere beginning, however, for popular conceptions of primate lifestyles are eroding swiftly along many axes of investigation. It is becoming clear, for instance, that many primates—from prosimians to humans—are actually omnivores even though anthropologists have persistently miscast them as frugivores or carnivores. This false dichotomization of nonhuman versus human diets has led to a series of equally erroneous dichotomies in nonhuman versus human behavior. Thus, the possession of culture, technology, language and other similarly amorphous traits, many of which were in fact derived from this presumed shift in subsistence, have become entrenched as concepts of human uniqueness. In recent years, however, many new discoveries in primatology, and in ethnography and archeology, have weakened the theoretical structure to which “man-the-hunter” has been pinned. It is probable that savanna-dwelling, tool-using, seed-eating, scavenging and other independent schemes can now be replaced by a single, much simpler model wherein subsistence shifts among both nonhuman and human primates are perceived as smooth transitions within a graded continuum of evolution. Thus, the central objective of this report is to show that the subsistence activities of several extant cercopithecid, pongid and hominid populations in Africa can be arranged along an integrated spectrum which reflects gradual processes in the evolution of primate behavior and organization.

 abstract = {Evidence for the acquisition of nutritionally dense food resources by early Pleistocene hominins has implications for both hominin biology and behavior. Aquatic fauna may have comprised a source of highly nutritious resources to hominins in the Turkana Basin at ∼1.95 Ma. Here we employ multiple datasets to examine the issue of aquatic resource use in the early Pleistocene. This study focuses on four components of aquatic faunal assemblages (1) taxonomic diversity, (2) skeletal element proportion, (3) bone fragmentation and (4) bone surface modification. These components are used to identify associations between early Pleistocene aquatic remains and hominin behavior at the site of FwJj20 in the Koobi Fora Fm. (Kenya). We focus on two dominant aquatic species: catfish and turtles. Further we suggest that data on aquatic resource availability as well as ethnographic examples of aquatic resource use complement our observations on the archaeological remains from FwJj20. Aquatic food items provided hominins with a valuable nutritional alternative to an exclusively terrestrial resource base. We argue that specific advantages afforded by an aquatic alternative to terrestrial resources include (1) a probable reduction in required investment of energy relative to economic return in the form of nutritionally dense food items, (2) a decrease in the technological costs of resource acquisition, and (3) a reduced level of inter-specific competition associated with carcass access and an associated reduction of predation risk relative to terrestrial sources of food. The combined evidence from FwJj20 suggests that aquatic resources may have played a substantial role in early Pleistocene diets and these resources may have been overlooked in previous interpretations of hominin behavior.},

Some cooperatively produced resources may be monopolized by individuals who invest in within-group competition, but these have largely been overlooked in empirical and theoretical research on human cooperation, which has focused on noncontestable public goods. In this study, we allow for the potential of within-group competition over cooperatively produced resources and use a game theoretic “tug-of-war” model and empirical test to show that such competition decreases the degree of cooperation within human groups and hence decreases group members' payoffs. Our study thus sheds light on how cooperative production and equal division of shared resources may have evolved, expands on current models of human cooperation to reflect the many natural conditions with opportunities for within-group competition, and demonstrates unifying principles in cooperation and competition across the animal kingdom.},

 abstract = {The recognition by archaeologists over the last fifteen years or so that even a discipline as down to earth as prehistory requires a theoretical basis has led to a diversity of research objectives. Essentially this has been a move away from the delineation of chronology and culture narrative towards an understanding of the behaviour of prehistoric man, requiring the development of theories relating to his ecological adaptation, his social organization, and his cognitive behaviour. The reassessment of archaeology has largely been at an explanatory or interpretative level. To some extent this has of course been paralleled by the increasingly sophisticated scientific and analytical techniques that are now available to aid in the interpretation of archaeological data. However, whilst archaeologists are more rigorous than ever before, and have developed a whole range of concepts for tackling the problems of prehistory, the actual data base employed by archaeologists has remained remarkably static. Field theory and methodology is essentially that of the earliest archaeologists. As Clarke (1973, 10) has commented, ‘harnessing powerful new methodological horses to rickety old conceptual carts has proved to be a powerful but drastic way of improving archaeological constructs by elimination’. Equally, though, the gleaming, streamlined conceptual chariots of the 1980s will go no further nor faster unless some attempt is made to update the roads over which they are expected to travel. What is necessary is a reassessment of what archaeological field data represent, i.e. how is the archaeological record formed?},

 abstract = {The existing human genome reflects evolutionary experience of human and prehuman ancestral species extending ultimately to the origin of life on earth. Comparative studies reveal that over 98% of our genes are shared by chimpanzees and gorillas (1) so that most of our genetic makeup must antedate the hominid-pongid split when the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees diverged, perhaps five million years ago. Early hominine evolution, dominated by successive Ardipithecine and Australopithecine species, produced characteristics, including hairlessness and erect posture, which set our ancestors apart from other primates. However, it was the Pleistocene, the 2 5 million years preceding agriculture, during which the defining characteristics of contemporary humans were selected: our resting metabolic rate, body proportions, sexual dimorphism, daily foraging range (which became more like that of carnivores and less primate-like) and brain size (2,3). Under certain circumstances genetic evolution can be “rapid.” For example, significant changes in large mammal (e.g., red deer, mastodon, bison) body size have occurred in just a few thousand years. However, recent conditions have not been conducive to human evolutionary innovation. Increased population size and greater mobility have led to the conclusion that, “... never ever, in the history of any species, have conditions been less propitious for the fixation of evolutionary novelties” (4 – see also 5,6). So, while genetic evolution has continued since the appearance of agriculture, it is not hyperbole to maintain that from the standpoint of our genes all humans living in the present are still Stone Agers — well over 99% identical, genetically, to our ancestors of 15,000 years ago. Our biochemistry and physiology remain adapted for the lifestyle which existed then, not that of the present.},

 abstract = {When deciding which parts of a prey animal to transport home, hunters may be more or less selective. In our vocabulary, unselective hunters are those who usually bring home most of the carcass; selective hunters are those who usually abandon all but the choicest (and/or lightest) parts. This paper uses the abcml statistical method to develop a means of estimating transport selectivity from the frequencies of skeletal parts in a faunal assemblage. It then applies the method to artiodactyl data from the Emeryville Shellmound in order to test the local depression and distant patch use hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that selectivity should decline during the early part of the Emeryville sequence and rise during the later part. The initial analysis did reveal such a pattern, but this pattern disappeared when samples were pooled in order to produce acceptably narrow confidence intervals. Although this result weakens the hypothesis, it does not firmly refute it, because the model fits the data imperfectly in the critical middle portion of the sequence. Abcml also provides estimates of the intensity of attrition, which indicate that attrition was most severe in early strata and least severe in later ones. Substantial attrition (50% of bones surviving) is indicated even from samples that show no indication of attrition using conventional methods. These conclusions are based on assumptions about the processes of transport and attrition that are more reliable in qualitative outline than in quantitative detail. Consequently, the paper's qualitative conclusions are more trustworthy than its quantitative estimates.},

Lacking a fossil or archaeological record for proto-chimpanzees, reconstructions of the antecedents of modern chimp nesting patterns can be reconstructed only from careful studies of variation in current chimpanzee and bonobo nesting patterns within the context of spatial and temporal landscape parameters. The ethology of nesting also provides an important frame of reference for reconstructions of early hominid nesting behavior. If the contemporary contrast between human and chimpanzee nesting patterns is seen as an evolutionary dichotomy, then African prehistoric landmarks that mark the origin of this split might include bipedalism and the origins of the hominidae, the first stone tools and the origins of Homo, the developmental and behavioral adaptations of Homo ergaster, shifts in Late Acheulian settlement patterns, and the origins of anatomically modern humans and the Middle Stone Age. The issue of whether Early Stone Age archaeological sites were used for nesting is unresolved because potential markers of such behavior, such as hearths, structures, or bedding, are not unambiguously recognizable in the archaeological record until the Middle Stone Age.},

This species represented a focal resource for the two regional groups centred on the East Channel of the Mackenzie River, but was available much less frequently and reliably to adjacent groups, who relied to a greater degree on alternative resources such as caribou, fish, seals, and bowhead whales. In this paper, we compare archaeofaunas from sites located in the “core” beluga whaling zone of the Mackenzie River East Channel with other sites to the east and west for which direct access to beluga whales was either reduced or non‐existent. Bone frequencies are compared both in terms of proportional species representation in site archaeofaunas, and in terms of differential element representation. These comparisons are then interpreted within a framework emphasizing regional economic patterns, as well as local variability in patterns of beluga acquisition, storage, transport, and disposal.

 abstract = {A prime example of applied alkaloids—doubtless before medicinal use—are poisons for weapons, especially arrow poisons. The use of poisoned weapons is a fascinating aspect of man’s attempts to gain mastery over a hostile environment, to provide food, and to protect himself from his animal and human enemies. Not least important, the biologically active plants yielded drugs and remedies for his diseases. A great deal of anecdotal information has already been lost, but, in spite of their often-prognosticated disappearance, plants containing toxic principles are by no means a thing of the past. Poisons derived from plants continue to be utilized not only in hunting food and against the depredations of wild animals, but also in tribal warfare, especially in Africa. Associated with this, at present, is the extensive use of constituents of the plants providing the hunting poisons as sources of medicines; in Africa these are among the most renowned plants of traditional medicine. The dreaded arrow poisons have provided medicine for effective therapy, or have been applied as tools in research. The best-known examples are ouabain and k-strophanthin for acute cardiac insufficiency, physostigmine for treatment of glaucoma and myasthenia gravis, d-tubocurarine as a muscle relaxant in anesthesia, reserpine as an antihypertensive and psychotropic drug, and ajmaline for cases of cardiac rhythm disturbances. Often, however, the therapeutic effects of the plant extract with its complex of compounds may be more beneficial than the effects of an individual compound.},

 abstract = {Although early Homo is hypothesized to have used tools more than australopiths to process foods prior to consumption, it is unknown how much the food processing techniques they used altered the material properties of foods, and therefore the masticatory forces they generated, and how well they were able to comminute foods. This study presents experimental data on changes to food material properties caused by mechanical tenderization (pounding with a stone tool) and cooking (dry roasting) of two foods likely to have been important components of the hominin diet: meat and tubers. Mechanical tenderization significantly decreased tuber toughness by 42%, but had no effect on meat toughness. Roasting significantly decreased several material properties of tubers correlated with masticatory effort including toughness (49%), fracture stress (28%) and elastic modulus (45%), but increased the toughness (77%), fracture stress (50%-222%), and elastic modulus of muscle fibers in meat (308%). Despite increasing many material properties of meat associated with higher masticatory forces, roasting also decreased measured energy loss by 28%, which likely makes it easier to chew. These results suggest that the use of food processing techniques by early Homo probably differed for meat and tubers, but together would have reduced masticatory effort, helping to relax selection to maintain large, robust faces and large, thickly enameled teeth. },

 abstract = { Traditional scavenging models have emphasized that a secondary intervention of hominins to carcasses previously consumed by carnivores should yield high tooth mark frequencies on long bone shafts. It has also been shown that the most feasible scavenging scenario for early Pleistocene African hominins would have been acquiring carcasses from felid kills and prior to hyenid intervention. Oddly, most experiments conducted in the past 20 years have been mostly based on bone modification patterns created by durophagous carnivores. Previous works emphasized that a felid-hominin model would be reflected in low frequencies of tooth-marked shaft specimens. The present work intends to put this hypothesis fully to test by replicating the complete felid-hominin scenario. Hammerstone breakage of bones from wild lion kills was simulated and the resulting anatomical and bone portion distribution of tooth mark frequencies was documented. Here, it is shown that wild lions inflict moderate damage to long bone ends. In contrast, hammerstone-broken shaft specimens bear very few tooth marks (usually <10% of fragments). It is shown that most damage inflicted by lions on carcasses during consumption occur on upper limb bones. Distal portions of radius-ulnae and tibiae are the least affected areas. This referential framework can potentially be applied to the archaeological record to reassert primary access to carcasses in some early Pleistocene African sites and unravel hominin-carnivore contribution to middle and late Pleistocene Eurasian palimpsests.},

Hallan Cemi Tepesi: High-ranked Game Exploitation alongside Intensive Seed Processing at the Epipaleolithic-Neolithic Transition in Southeastern Turkey. Anthropozoologica 44(1): 41-61. Faunal evidence from Hallan emi Tepesi in southeastern Turkey reveals important similarities and differences in subsistence patterns when compared to the Levant at the time of the Epipaleolithic-Neolithic transition. Possible diet breadth expansion is examined at Hallan emi based on prey species and biomass composition, body part analysis, age profiles, and carcass processing patterns. The occupants of Hallan emi hunted a wide range of animals, including wild sheep and goats, pigs, red deer, and tortoises. Low-ranked, fast-moving small game animals such as hares and avian fauna are comparatively rare. Small game use at Hallan emi resembles patterns observed in some late Natufian sites, but there is focused exploitation of ungulates at Hallan emi. The site presents a seemingly contradictory pairing of a meat diet composed of high-ranked animal resources and intensive plant seed processing. Also supporting the overall picture of high-ranked animal exploitation are transport biases that favored the meatiest portions of ungulate carcasses, particularly the upper front limb region. Potential explanations for the contrasting meat and plant diet patterns must consider expanding diet breadth in response to demographic packing (expressed mainly in terms of plant exploitation) and display behaviors that emphasized large game but not other parts of the food supply.},

Results were evaluated against anthropometric and serological relationships. No clearly superior approach emerges, although it is generally true that palmar variables exhibit more intergroup heterogeneity than digital variables and produce more reasonable results than the other approaches. The conventional method of treating ridge-counts, that of choosing the larger of the two counts, was the most unsatisfactory of the quantitative approaches, leading to the recommendation that both radial and ulnar counts be retained. We conclude that environmental variation may contribute substantially to intergroup variation.},

 abstract = {In many archaeological faunas, relative to smaller ungulates, larger ones are more poorly represented by proximal limb bones (humeri, radioulnae, femora and tibiae) and better represented by bones of the feet and skull. In a recent issue of this journal, Bartram & Marean refer to the contrast as the “Klasies Pattern” for its occurrence at the Klasies River Mouth Middle Stone Age site in South Africa. However, they argue that it exists only because archaeologists often fail to identify small midshaft fragments to skeletal part and taxon. They believe that most archaeological faunas have been heavily ravaged by carnivores that selectively removed proximal limb bone epiphyses and left the associated shaft fragments behind. In support, they cite analyses by Marean and his co-workers in which proximal limb bone numbers increased significantly when shaft fragments were refitted to produce identifiable specimens. The dramatic increase in proximal limb bone numbers at Kobeh Cave, Iran is particularly compelling, but Bartram & Marean must spell out their procedure for identifying and counting shafts to ensure that others can produce comparable results and to exclude the possibility that the results are an artefact of their procedure. The refitting of small shaft fragments is extremely tedious and time-consuming, but may be justified wherever there is independent evidence for substantial carnivore ravaging. There is essentially no evidence for carnivore ravaging at Klasies River Mouth nor is there evidence that it can produce the contrast between smaller and larger ungulates that comprises the “Klasies Pattern”.

 abstract = {The thermo-altered Dasypodidae bone remains from El Guanaco 2 site (ca. 9000–6000 YBP, Pampean Region, Argentina) were analyzed through an experimental study. The experimentation involved the cooking of three individuals of Chaetophractus villosus and the burring of three carapaces under the hearth, in order to recognize the degrees of burning damage on osteoderms according to the time of heat exposure and the burring depth in sediments. The results showed similarities between archaeological and actualistic assemblages, including the non-uniform burning damage and scarce endoskeleton thermal modification, but the armors buried didn't show evidence of burning damage. Based on these comparative results, it is suggested that the Dasypodidae assemblages of El Guanaco 2 site derive from hunter gatherers butchering, cooking and consumption of armadillos.},

In the steppe, lesser rhea (Pterocnemia pennata), a medium-sized flightless bird, also was integrated into the hunter-gatherer diet. Rodents, carnivores, flying birds, and fishes also were recovered. Different processes and agents were involved in the accumulation of small vertebrates bone assemblages (e.g. birds of prey, foxes, and small carnivores). In the steppe, only two taxa of small vertebrates—birds and mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia)—can be related with human subsistence activities. These two taxa and all large vertebrates reveal fat-oriented carcass processing.Guanaco bone assemblages associated both with ceramic and non-ceramic technologies do not show changes in carcass processing.

 abstract = {Vegetation and plant foods for hominins of lowermost Bed II, Olduvai Gorge were modeled by examining vegetation in modern habitats in northern Tanzania (Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro, Serengeti) that are analogous to the paleolandscape in terms of climate, land forms, and soil types, as indicated by previous paleoenvironmental studies of Olduvai. Plant species in the modern habitats were identified in a series of sample plots, and those known to be eaten by modern humans, chimpanzees, or baboons were considered potentially edible for early hominins. Within the 50-80 kyr deposition of lowermost Bed II, periods of drier climate were characterized by low lake stands and a broad eastern lacustrine plain containing a mosaic of springs, marsh, woodland, and edaphic grassland. Based on results of this study, plant food diversity in each of those habitats was relatively low, but the mosaic nature of the area meant that hominins could reach several different habitat types within short distances, with access to potential plant foods including marsh plants, grass grains, roots, shrub fruits, edible parts from palms, leafy herbaceous plants, and Acacia pods, flowers, and gum. Based on Manyara analogs, a greater variety of plant foods, such as tree fruits (e.g., Ficus, Trichilia) and the roots and fruits of shrubs (e.g., Cordia, Salvadora) would be expected further east along the rivers in the lacustrine terrace and alluvial fans. Interfluves of the alluvial fans were probably less wooded and offered relatively fewer varieties of plant foods, but there is sparse paleoenvironmental evidence for the character of Olduvai's alluvial fans, making the choice of appropriate modern analogs difficult. In the western side of the basin, based on modern analogs in the Serengeti, riverine habitats provided the greatest variety of edible plant food species (e.g., Acacia, Grewia, Justicia). If the interfluves were grassland, then a large variety of potentially edible grasses and forbs were present seasonally. Periods of wetter climate resulted in a much expanded paleolake and a shrinking of the eastern lacustrine plain mosaic into a narrow zone. The dominant landscape features were then forest-lined rivers in the eastern alluvial fans, and rivers in the western side of the paleo-Olduvai basin were also better watered at these times, supporting denser woody vegetation with large varieties of edible fruits, leaves, and underground parts.},

 abstract = {Fossilized footprints preserved in volcanic ash tuffs in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park afford an exceptional opportunity to study footprints of traditionally unshod modern human pedestrians, laid down under conditions relatively similar to those associated with footprints made by Pliocene hominids at the east African site of Laetoli, Tanzania. The Hawaiian footprint area encompasses about 13 km2 of the Ka’u Desert. Two footprintbearing ash layers date to 200 and 400 years before present (ybp) respectively. The track localities were surveyed with GPS coordinates and photographed, including stereophotography. In many instances footprint clarity and preservation are exceptional, revealing anatomical details of foot shape, toe conformation and arch development. Footprints were contrasted with stereophotos and casts of the Laetoli tracks and with footprints made by a captive chimpanzee in a sand trackbox. The modern human footprints were distinct in the marked development of the ball of the foot and toe pads, indicative of differential weight bearing or traction by these structures. There is consistent expression of a well-developed arch and no indication of midtarsal flexion. In contrast, the Laetoli hominid tracks do not exhibit these adaptations. Instead, they display a tapering proximal heel outline, relatively narrow distal metatarsus, indistinct ball and poorly differentiated impressions of the lateral toes. Preservation of the ash layer is patchy throughout the Ka’u footprint area; however, several examples of tracks permit limited documentation of spontaneous gait parameters. Contrasts with the Laetoli tracks emphasize the short step length of the fossil hominid gait and the highly variable angle of gait and step width in both ancient hominid and modern human trackways.},

One feature that has figured prominently in adaptationist accounts of religion is belief in the reality of moralizing, punishing supernatural agents. However, there is at present no unified theory of what fitness-relevant feature of the selective environment to which this cognitive predisposition is adapted. We distinguish two divergent and often conflated approaches to supernatural punishment theory which hypothesize the adaptive character of such beliefs arise from the fact that they increase cooperation or decrease the cost of incurring punishment for norm violations. We evaluate these, and group and individual selectionist versions, in view of game theoretic models, experimental studies, and ethnographic data in light of which each proposal is plausible but with which none is fully concordant.},

 abstract = {Ingestion of innocuous antigens, including food proteins, normally results in local and systemic immune nonresponsiveness in a process termed oral tolerance. Oral tolerance to food proteins is likely to be intimately linked to mechanisms that are responsible for gastrointestinal tolerance to large numbers of commensal microbes. Here we review our current understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for oral tolerance and how perturbations in these mechanisms might promote the loss of oral tolerance and development of food allergies. Roles for the commensal microbiome in promoting oral tolerance and the association of intestinal dysbiosis with food allergy are discussed. Growing evidence supports cutaneous sensitization to food antigens as one possible mechanism leading to the failure to develop or loss of oral tolerance. A goal of immunotherapy for food allergies is to induce sustained desensitization or even true long-term oral tolerance to food allergens through mechanisms that might in part overlap with those associated with the development of natural oral tolerance. },

 abstract = {Theories of the economic evolution of societies and their diversity are critically examined, paying particular attention to the evolution of hunter-gatherer societies. An interdisciplinary approach drawing on anthropology and economics is adopted. Currently, three main stereotypes of the nature of hunter-gatherer societies exist. While these indicate that they were diverse, they fail to capture the full extent of their diversity. It is argued that this diversity increased with the passage of time and was shaped by the varied local eco-geographic conditions in which these societies evolved. This raises the question of whether this development had the same basis as speciation in the biological theory of natural selection. This is discussed and then particular attention is given to Adam Smith’s vision of the economic evolution of human societies. In conclusion, it is hypothesized that the evolutionary path of modern economies and societies has diverged from that of prehistoric societies—they have become less diverse. Modern societies may also have become more ultrasocial, a process which accelerated following the commencement of agriculture.},

 abstract = {While hundreds of loci have been identified as reflecting strong-positive selection in human populations, connections between candidate loci and specific selective pressures often remain obscure. This study investigates broader patterns of selection in African populations, which are underrepresented despite their potential to offer key insights into human adaptation. We scan for hard selective sweeps using several haplotype and allele-frequency statistics with a data set of nearly 500,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 12 highly diverged African populations that span a range of environments and subsistence strategies. We find that positive selection does not appear to be a strong determinant of allele-frequency differentiation among these African populations. Haplotype statistics do identify putatively selected regions that are shared across African populations. However, as assessed by extensive simulations, patterns of haplotype sharing between African populations follow neutral expectations and suggest that tails of the empirical distributions contain false-positive signals. After highlighting several genomic regions where positive selection can be inferred with higher confidence, we use a novel method to identify biological functions enriched among populations' empirical tail genomic windows, such as immune response in agricultural groups. In general, however, it seems that current methods for selection scans are poorly suited to populations that, like the African populations in this study, are affected by ascertainment bias and have low levels of linkage disequilibrium, possibly old selective sweeps, and potentially reduced phasing accuracy. Additionally, population history can confound the interpretation of selection statistics, suggesting that greater care is needed in attributing broad genetic patterns to human adaptation.},

 abstract = {BackgroundOne of the most important dietary shifts underwent by human populations began to occur in the Neolithic, during which new modes of subsistence emerged and new nutrients were introduced in diets. This change might have worked as a selective pressure over the metabolic pathways involved in the breakdown of substances extracted from food. Here we applied a candidate gene approach to investigate whether in populations with different modes of subsistence, diet-related genetic adaptations could be identified in the genes AGXT, PLRP2, MTRR, NAT2 and CYP3A5.ResultsAt CYP3A5, strong signatures of positive selection were detected, though not connected to any dietary variable, but instead to an environmental factor associated with the Tropic of Cancer. Suggestive signals of adaptions that could indeed be connected with differences in dietary habits of populations were only found for PLRP2 and NAT2. Contrarily, the demographic history of human populations seemed enough to explain patterns of diversity at AGXT and MTRR, once both conformed the evolutionary expectations under selective neutrality.ConclusionsAccumulated evidence indicates that CYP3A5 has been under adaptive evolution during the history of human populations. PLRP2 and NAT2 also appear to have been modelled by some selective constrains, although clear support for that did not resist to a genome wide perspective. It is still necessary to clarify which were the biological mechanisms and the environmental factors involved as well as their interactions, to understand the nature and strength of the selective pressures that contributed to shape current patterns of genetic diversity at those loci.},

Thèse présentée à l’Université Bordeaux I, no. 2614.] has shown that securely interleaved Châtelperronian and Aurignacian deposits do not exist here and has also allowed archaeological material from stratigraphically secure contexts within the site to be distinguished from stratigraphically insecure ones. Here, we reanalyze the large mammal fauna from Roc de Combe to examine differences that might have existed in faunal use during Roc de Combe’s Châtelperronian and Aurignacian occupations. The results suggest little if any dietary difference between the Châtelperronian and earliest Aurignacian assemblages, insofar as such differences can be inferred from zooarchaeological data, agreeing with recent analyses conducted at Grotte XVI [Grayson, D.K., Delpech, F., 2005.

 abstract = {At first sight, modern economics and justice seem not to fit together. Whereas the former primarily deals with individual self-interest and extrinsic incentives, the latter deals with other-regardingness and intrinsic social motives. However, recent findings, mainly from the field of experimental economics, reintroduce aspects of justice into economic modeling. Other theories, evolutionary models for instance, take up the key findings and apply the economic rationale in order to find out why human traits which apparently run counter to individual self-interest may have survived. In this introductory note we date this discussion back to the days of Adam Smith and argue that he already set the basis for such a discussion. Apparently, Smith was well aware that principles of justice and the market may, at times, be contradictory. However, he also found that both served a common purpose, or so we will argue. We further aim at bringing together Smith's classical position with recent ideas, for instance Binmore's theory of justice, and see whether the one can be fruitful for the other.},

 abstract = {Because modern humans originated in Africa and have adapted to diverse environments, African populations have high levels of genetic and phenotypic diversity. Thus, genomic studies of diverse African ethnic groups are essential for understanding human evolutionary history and how this leads to differential disease risk in all humans. Comparative studies of genetic diversity within and between African ethnic groups creates an opportunity to reconstruct some of the earliest events in human population history and are useful for identifying patterns of genetic variation that have been influenced by recent natural selection. Here we describe what is currently known about genetic variation and evolutionary history of diverse African ethnic groups. We also describe examples of recent natural selection in African genomes and how these data are informative for understanding the frequency of many genetic traits, including those that cause disease susceptibility in African populations and populations of recent African descent. },

 abstract = {The caves at Klasies River Mouth (KRM) in the southern Cape Province, South Africa, continue to play an important role in the study of human evolution and debates about the origins of “modern” humans. As with most Palaeolithic sites, the behavioural interpretations offered for the Middle Stone Age (MSA) inhabitants of the KRM caves are based in large part on the interpretation of fragmentary faunal remains from the “Main Site”, or caves 1, 1A, 1B and 2 excavated in 1967–68 by Singer & Wymer (1982). Using zooarchaeological patterns detected in ethnoarchaeological data collected among Kua foragers of the eastern Kalahari, Central District, Botswana, as well as in data collected from Die Kelders Cave 1, Layer 10, South Africa, we offer an alternative explanation for a provocative pattern of skeletal part representation discovered in the KRM MSA archaeofauna over 20 years ago by Richard Klein (1976). The Klasies pattern is characterized by the underrepresentation of large bovid upper limb elements relative to more anatomically complete small bovids. To date, the pattern has been interpreted in three different ways, each with strikingly different implications for Middle Stone Age (MSA)/Middle Palaeolithic (MP) human behaviour. Understanding the nature of the pattern is not only important for reconstructing MSA human behaviour at KRM, but it is also important for understanding how the conduct of zooarchaeological analyses can profoundly influence our reconstructions of the course of human behavioural evolution. The Kua ethnoarchaeological data and experimental case studies unambiguously connect to site formation histories to zooarchaeological patterns. At Die Kelders Cave 1, Layer 10, the ethnoarchaeological expectations are expressed archaeologically in a context analytically relevant to KRM. Overall, by joining the Kua and the Die Kelders data, we show how uniformitarian/actualistic approaches can be productively employed in zooarchaeological interpretation. The “Klasies Pattern” is likely to be an artefact of a widespread taphonomic sequence, followed by a particular style of analysis employed, for practical reasons, by many zooarchaeologists. We suggest that the situation is common and likely to be seriously distorting inferences about many archaeofaunas around the world. More generally we show how uniformitarian studies offer a coherent framework for developing methods and generating data useful in making behavioural inferences from faunal remains. Rather than a human behavioural signal in the KRM archaeofauna, the Klasies Pattern has more to do with the methods of zooarchaeology than with the behaviour of ancient people.},

 abstract = {The late Lower Paleolithic archaeofaunas of Qesem Cave in the southern Levant span 400-200 ka and associate with Acheulo-Yabrudian (mainly Amudian) industries. The large mammals are exclusively Eurasian in origin and formed under relatively cool, moist conditions. The zooarchaeological findings testify to large game hunting, hearth-centered carcass processing and meat sharing during the late Lower Paleolithic, not unlike the patterns known from Middle and Upper Paleolithic caves in the region. Well-defined hearth features are rarely preserved in Qesem Cave, but the heterogeneous distributions of burned bones indicate areas of frequent hearth rebuilding throughout the occupation sequence. The hominins delayed consumption of high quality body parts until they could be moved to the cave, where hearths were hubs of processing activities and social interaction. Paradoxically, the cut marks on the Qesem bones are both more abundant and more randomly oriented than those observed in Middle and Upper Paleolithic cases in the Levant. These results suggest that several individuals were directly involved in cutting meat from the bones and that the social mechanics of meat sharing during the late Lower Paleolithic at Qesem Cave differed from those typical of both the Middle and Upper Paleolithic in the region.},

We collected and butchered three pronghorn between October 2012 and February 2013. The butchered anatomical units were weighed to determine mass and butchering process was timed to yield processing times. The mass was then converted to energy (kcal) and with the addition of the processing times, we provide the energetic return rates (kcal/h). Based on these results, we are able to rank the economic value of each anatomical unit. We then compared these economic values to three pronghorn communal kill sites. The results of this study indicate a preferential bias toward appendicular elements for marrow processing. This study contributes to the investigation of human subsistence on pronghorn and to the growing literature detailing the importance of this species to North American human prehistory.},

The example of present fuel management practices among a residentially mobile group of Evenk Siberian reindeer herders, shows how ethnoarchaeology can provide an analytical background for the study of complex man–environment interrelations. Ethnographic observation confirmed in particular that the moisture content and structural soundness of the wood can be linked to hearth function: rotten conifers for instance, are used for hide smoking by several groups living in the boreal forests of the Northern hemisphere. Charcoal samples from an Evenk hearth fed with rotten Larix cajanderi (Siberian larch) showed a high proportion of microscopic features diagnostic of fungal alterations.A series of systematic experimental combustions on Pinus sylvestris (scots Pine) confirmed the existence of a relationship between the frequency and the intensity of fungal alterations visible after the combustion and the initial state of the wood used in the hearth. The establishment of an alteration index allows now to take a new parameter, the structural soundness of the wood, into account when performing archaeological charcoal analyses.},

In one's own culture, it is easy to fail to see that a cultural lens exists and instead to think that there is no lens at all, only reality. Hence, studying culture requires stepping out of it. There are two main methods to do so: The first involves using between-group comparisons to highlight differences and the second involves using experimental methods to test the consequences of disruption to implicit cultural frames. These methods highlight three ways that culture organizes experience: (a) It shields reflexive processing by making everyday life feel predictable, (b) it scaffolds which cognitive procedure (connect, separate, or order) will be the default in ambiguous situations, and (c) it facilitates situation-specific accessibility of alternate cognitive procedures. Modern societal social-demographic trends reduce predictability and increase collectivism and honor-based go-to cognitive procedures.},

Results for three Homo cf. ergaster individuals are indistinguishable from those of A. robustus, showing that proportions of C(3)- and C(4)-based foods in their diets did not differ. P. pardus, Megantereon and Crocuta are shown to be likely predators of the hominids and Papio baboons in Member 1, while the Dinofelis individual concentrated on prey which consumed C(4)grasses. The hunting hyaenid C. nitidula preyed on either mixed feeders or on a range of animals across the spectrum of C(3)and C(4)variation. The data from Members 1 and 2 confirm a shift in leopard diets towards animals that consumed C(4)grasses.},

 abstract = {Pleistocene foragers used several prey acquisition and processing strategies. These strategies and their associated decisions are elucidated by taphonomic studies that cover animal transport, modifications by different agents and archaeological remains. Interpretative models of archaeological sites are by necessity based on natural and experimental observations. Ethno-archaeological data shows that several factors influenced decisions about carcass transport from the kill site to the home site. These factors often have little archaeological visibility. Díez et al. (1999) has previously interpreted the general characteristics of the macro-mammal remains from Gran Dolina Level TD6-2 (Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain) as the result of anthropic accumulation, in which the anatomical profiles appeared to be the result of selective transport based on the animals' weight. Recent taphonomic analysis has shown that carcasses with different weights may be subject to similar transport strategies, suggesting that other factors influenced these choices. The hominins that occupied TD6-2 (the TD6-2 hominin group), at least sometimes, transported large carcasses to the cave in their entirety, implying participation by groups of individuals in hunting parties. These individuals delayed their consumption of large amounts of food, instead moving it to Gran Dolina, where it was shared with other group members. These decisions are evidence of social cooperation and food sharing amongst early European hominins.},

 abstract = {During the past two decades, there has been a substantial evolution in thinking about the earliest human populations in Alaska. The advent of accelerator mass spectrometry CAMS) dating, enabling the dating of small amounts of remnant collagen in ancient bones, allowed the redating of the most diagnostic human implement from the Old Crow basin in the northern Yukon Territory—the famous caribou tibia flesher—from circa 28,000 bp to circa 1,800 bp. Coupled with demonstrations that other taphonomic agents—ranging from carnivores to ice push—could have been responsible for spiral fractures and polish found on the redeposited bones of the Old Crow River gravels, this redating took away the confidence of most Arctic archaeologists that such “preprojectile point” sites did in fact represent an earlier stage in the peopling of northern North America. Thus, Old Crow joined earlier constructions such as Sedna Creek, Engigstciak, and the British Mountain Complex of the North Slope of Alaska and the adjacent Mackenzie River drainage as representative elements of a hypothetical but unproven stage of occupation of northwest North America predating circa 13,000 bp.},

The advent of isotopic dating has had a great impact particularly on studies of early hominid behaviour and Iron Age research. Ethno‐archaeological research is particularly well developed and very relevant for archaeologists outside of Africa. Much of African archaeology is presently cultural‐historically oriented, unevenly dispersed and highly localized and the number of African archaeologists is small.

 abstract = { Predator/prey relationships in Mediterranean Europe during the Early Pleistocene are analysed at the local and regional scales and compared to patterns observed in recent fauna from four regions worldwide (East Africa, South Africa, Southeast Asia and North America). Three subregions (South Eastern, Central and South Western Mediterranean) and three time periods (middle Villafranchian, late Villafranchian and Galerian) are considered. Our approach focuses on large primary consumers and their potential predators; both are defined as mammals weighing over 10kg. Early Pleistocene food webs are characterised by a unique body size distribution of primary consumers and an extremely rich carnivore guild. These characteristics likely affected ecosystem function in a way not observed in recent communities. The percentage of megafauna species was higher in the middle Villafranchian than in recent fauna, and it increased in the late Villafranchian and early Galerian. The number of predators able to kill megafauna species was high in the late Villafranchian but decreased to modern values in the early Galerian. Competition inside the carnivore guild was similar to recent values in the middle Villafranchian and early Galerian but higher in the late Villafranchian. Hominins likely entered Europe during the late Villafranchian, when survival opportunities for a hunter–gatherer were low and hominins were most likely relegated to a marginal role in the palaeocommunity. This scenario changed in the early Galerian with the extinction of several predators and relatively reduced intraguild competition.},

 abstract = {Recent high-throughput sequencing technology has led to an expansion of knowledge regarding the microbial communities (microbiome) across various built environments (BEs). The microbiome of the BE is dependent upon building factors and conditions that govern how outdoor microbes enter and persist in the BE. Additionally, occupants are crucial in shaping the microbiome of the BE by releasing human-associated microorganisms and resuspending microbes on floors and surfaces. Therefore, both the outdoors and occupants act as major sources of microorganisms found in the BE. However, most characterizations of the microbiome of the BE have been conducted in the Western world. Notably, outdoor locations and population groups present geographical variations in outdoor and human microbiomes, respectively. Given the influences of the outdoor and human microbiomes on BE microbiology, and the geographical variations in outdoor and human microbiomes, it is likely that the microbiomes of BEs also vary by location. The summation of microbiomes between BEs contribute to a potential BE pan-microbiome, which will both consist of microbes that are ubiquitous in indoor environments around the world, and microbes that appear to be endemic to particular geographical locations. Importantly, the BE pan-microbiome can potentially question the global application of our current views on indoor microbiology. In this review, we first provide an assessment on the roles of building and occupant properties on shaping the microbiome of the BE. This is then followed by a description of geographical variations in the microbiomes of the outdoors and humans, the two main sources of microbes in BEs. We present evidence of differences in microbiomes of BEs around the world, demonstrating the existence of a global pan-microbiome of the BE that is larger than the microbiome of any single indoor environment. Finally, we discuss the significance of understanding the BE pan-microbiome and identifying universal and location-specific relationships between building and occupant characteristics and indoor microbiology. This review highlights the much needed efforts towards determining the pan-microbiome of the BE, thereby identifying general and location-specific links between the microbial communities of the outdoors, human, and BE ecosystems, ultimately improving the health, comfort, and productivity of occupants around the world.},

(It is surely time to include Sign languages in our genealogies of language, and to devote as much space to them as to any other language family in our sociolinguistic surveys.) The Khoe (formerly called ‘Hottentot’) and San (a.k.a. ‘Bushman’) languages, thought to be historically unrelated (and in fact divisible into three families) are now, with very few exceptions, close to extinction. The Bantu languages (belonging to the wider Niger–Congo family) are the numerically predominant languages of the country, comprising essentially the following: the Nguni cluster (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati, Ndebele); the Sotho cluster (North Sotho, South Sotho, Tswana); Tsonga; Venda. (See map 15.1 for the main distribution patterns of these languages.) The term ‘cluster’ denotes a set of varieties that are closely related along linguistic lines (though in terms of socio-political status the varieties may be quite independent). In addition to these official languages a number of Bantu languages are spoken in smaller numbers by migrant mineworkers from neighbouring countries, and by more recent immigrants. Such languages include Chopi, Kalanga, Shona, Chewa, etc. Still other special cases exist: Phuthi, for example, is a minority language of the eastern Cape, more widely represented in the neighbouring country, Lesotho (Donnelly 1999); Makhuwa and Yao are languages spoken in Durban by the descendants of ex-slaves from Mozambique dating back to the 1870s (Mesthrie 1996).},

By way of an explanatory device, predictions concerning medicine are compared and contrasted to expectations as to the role of the sciences, natural and social. Investigation of the corpus of social prognostications in fact reveals a dearth of glorious expectations as to the future of medicine as such, although certain writings have held out great hopes for biologistic disciplines, such as eugenics. It is often in ‘golden age’ fantasies about the early history of mankind that the most glowing descriptions of complete health are painted. Similarly, perfect health is something often viewed not in social but in individualistic terms. Explanations are offered of these perhaps slightly surprising facts.},

 abstract = { The identification of cut marks has been integral to expanding the understanding of hominin behavior ranging from the origins of meat consumption to the role of human hunting in megafaunal extinctions and the timing of the peopling of the Americas. Paleoanthropological and archaeological research demonstrates cut mark placement can be indicative of activity, but cut mark morphology is more complex and influenced by multiple variables such as raw material, tool shape, and bone density. Significant overlap in the ‘classic’ features of cut marks, such as V-shaped cross-sections, has also been recognized in numerous processes including carnivore gnawing and trampling. Before researchers can refer to modified animal remains as proxies for a hominin presence, diagnostic patterns representative of past human behavior in the archaeological record must first be identified and distinguished from modern cultural processes. This paper develops an empirical multivariate and probabilistic approach for differentiating cut marks created by lithics from those by steel. The results identify no single diagnostic attribute of cut marks produced by lithics. However, an approach which includes excavation history, stratigraphic context, location, orientation, and mark color significantly improve the likelihood with which cut marks are identified accurately.},

 abstract = {Many traditional societies, often referred to as indigenous or tribal people, have accumulated a whole lot of empirical knowledge on the basis of their experience dealing with nature and natural resources. This traditional wisdom is based on the intrinsic realization that man and nature form part of an indivisible whole, and therefore should live in partnership with each other. Indeed, in recent years, one of the concerns of ethnobiologists and those concerned with sustainable development has been to evaluate ethnobiological information and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of value derived from the natural environment in which traditional societies live. These benefits of ethnobiological significance are of three kinds: (a) economic—traditional crop varieties and lesser known plants and animals of food value, medicinal plants, etc. harvested from the wild; (b) ecologic/social—manipulation of biodiversity for coping with uncertainties in the environment and global change, for controlling soil water regimes and hydrology, soil fertility management through soil biological processes, and for efficient organic residue management; (c) ethical—cultural, spiritual, and religious belief systems centered around the concept of the sacred species, sacred groves, and the sacred landscapes. Traditionally, TEK has tried to describe and evaluate species, from the point of view of its immediate economic value, food, medicinal, etc., to the society. It is only recently that the interest in TEK has moved in the direction of understanding the interconnections that often exist between ecological and social processes, determining the functional attributes of ecosystems/landscapes. Thus, for example the role of socially selected ecological keystone species within ecosystems in conserving and enhancing biodiversity, through key functions that they perform in an ecosystem; this has value in rehabilitation ecology; this therefore, is a critical area which offers opportunities for involving community participation. The way in which traditional societies perceive and manipulate biodiversity around them in the landscape (which includes a variety of natural and human-managed ecosystems), both in space and time, for ecosystem stability, integrating ecologically sound biotechnologies, such as soil fertility and soil water regimes, to cite two examples, are now being seen as critical for managing natural resources sustainably, with peoples' participation, in the context of ‘global change.’ In this effort, sacred landscapes, sacred groves, and sacred species, conserved by traditional species for sociocultural/religious reasons add another dimension towards community participation. If, indeed, we are looking for a shift in the ecodevelopmental paradigm, we need to view ecology, economics, and ethics as parts of an interconnected viewpoint; building upon TEK is one of the powerful tools that we have to take us in that direction.},

The concept of uniformitarianism is presented and demonstrates the importance of philosophical constructs in scientific work. Middle-range theory attempts to filter out false conclusions.

Subsequently, we address biotic aspects of fossil findings, and in this context we discuss taphonomy, stratigraphic research, and interactions between floral and faunal environment. In a synthesis, we present three cross sections of human evolution at different time horizons (early-middle-late) to exemplify the inevitable multidisciplinarity of paleoecology, and we present some key events that probably altered the direction of radiations among hominids. Obviously, human evolution is not a special kind of evolution; it follows the rules of evolutionary biology, and hence depends undoubtedly on environmental influences.},

 abstract = {Three assemblages of fallow deer (Dama sp.) bones excavated from the early middle Pleistocene (oxygen isotope stage 18) layers of the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel, furnish evidence of systematic and repeated exploitation of complete carcasses by hominins. The excellent state of preservation of the bones and the presence of only minimal signs of carnivore involvement permit an investigation of the role of hominins as the primary agents responsible for the damage to these bones. Hominin expertise in dealing with fallow deer carcasses is manifested by cut marks, percussion marks, and hack marks on the bones. The archaeozoological analysis of the anatomical position and frequency of these marks suggests that carcass processing followed systematic practices that reflect an in-depth knowledge of fallow deer anatomy and a consistent behavioral strategy. These assemblages represent one of the earliest examples of methodological butchering practices in Eurasia. The evidence of carcass processing observed at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov resembles that seen in late Pleistocene sites in Israel, which were inhabited by modern humans. We interpret the Gesher Benot Ya'aqov data as indicating that the Acheulian hunters at the site (1) were proficient communicators and learners and (2) possessed anatomical knowledge, considerable manual skill, impressive technological abilities, and foresight.},

Explaining how demand sharing evolved without punishment to free riders, who rarely hunt but receive resources from active hunters, has been a long-standing problem. Here we show through a simulation model that demand-sharing families that continuously move between camps in response to their energy income are able to survive in unpredictable environments typical of hunter-gatherers, while non-sharing families and sedentary families perish. Our model also predicts that non-producers (free riders, pre-adults and post-productive adults) can be sustained in relatively high numbers. As most of hominin pre-history evolved in hunter-gatherer settings, demand sharing may be an ancestral manifestation of hyper-cooperation and inequality aversion, allowing exploration of high-quality, hard-to-acquire resources, the evolution of fluid co-residence patterns and egalitarian resource distribution in the absence of punishment or warfare.},

 abstract = {The late Early Pleistocene site of Untermassfeld, dated to the Jaramillo subchron (ca. 1.07 millions of years ago), is well known for its rich Epivillafranchian fauna. It has also recently yielded stone artefacts attesting hominin occupation. Now, we report here, for the first time, evidence of hominin butchery such as cut marks and intentional hammerstone-related bone breakage. This probable subsistence behaviour was detected in a small faunal subsample recovered from levels with Mode 1 stone tools. The butchered faunal assemblage was found during fieldwork and surveying in fluvial riverbanks (Lower Fluviatile Sands) and channel erosion sediments (Upper Fluviatile Sands). The frequent occurrence of butchery traces on bones of large-sized herd animals (i.e., Bison) may imply a greater need for meat in seasonal habitats characterised by a depletion of nutritive plants in winter. Early access to carcasses, before their consumption by carnivores, provided hominins with sufficient quantities of meat. This access was acquired with a Mode 1 lithic industry, to ensure food procurement and survival at high latitudes in Europe. Stone tools and faunal remains with signs of anthropic intervention recovered at Untermassfeld are evidence of the oldest hominin settlement at continental mid-latitudes (50° N).},

 abstract = {Fluctuating and directional asymmetry are aspects of morphological variation widely used to infer environmental and genetic factors affecting facial phenotypes. However, the genetic basis and environmental determinants of both asymmetry types is far from being completely known. The analysis of facial asymmetries in admixed individuals can be of help to characterize the impact of a genome's heterozygosity on the developmental basis of both fluctuating and directional asymmetries. Here we characterize the association between genetic ancestry and individual asymmetry on a sample of Latin-American admixed populations. To do so, three-dimensional (3D) facial shape attributes were explored on a sample of 4,104 volunteers aged between 18 and 85 years. Individual ancestry and heterozygosity was estimated using more than 730,000 genome-wide markers. Multivariate techniques applied to geometric morphometric data were used to evaluate the magnitude and significance of directional and fluctuating asymmetry (FA), as well as correlations and multiple regressions aimed to estimate the relationship between facial FA scores and heterozygosity and a set of covariates. Results indicate that directional and FA are both significant, the former being the strongest expression of asymmetry in this sample. In addition, our analyses suggest that there are some specific patterns of facial asymmetries characterizing the different ancestry groups. Finally, we find that more heterozygous individuals exhibit lower levels of asymmetry. Our results highlight the importance of including ancestry-admixture estimators, especially when the analyses are aimed to compare levels of asymmetries on groups differing on socioeconomic levels, as a proxy to estimate developmental noise.},

 abstract = {For decades, the 'hunting-scavenging debate' has been an important research focus in Plio-Pleistocene hominin behavioral ecology. Here I present new data on potential scavenging opportunities from fresh carnivore kills on a conservancy in central Kenya. This ecosystem is dominated by felids (mainly lions) and has a different carnivore guild than in many earlier studies of scavenging opportunities that took place in areas such as Ngorongoro and Serengeti in Tanzania and Maasai Mara in Kenya, where lions face high levels of inter-specific competition from bone-crunching hyenas. I found that while scavenging opportunities vary among carcasses, most carcasses retained some scavengeable resources. Excluding within-bone resources, even the scavengeable meat on 'defleshed' larger sized prey carcasses is usually substantial enough to meet the total daily caloric requirements of at least one adult male Homo erectus individual. I argue, as others have before me, that scavenging opportunities in a particular ecosystem will vary in part due to carnivore taxon, density and guild composition; prey size, biomass and community structure; and habitat (e.g., vegetation, physiography). We should expect variability in scavenging opportunities in different locales and should focus our research efforts on identifying which variables condition these differences in order to make our findings applicable to the diversity of ecological settings characterizing the past. },

 abstract = {Abstract  Our species colonized North and South America last of all the major land masses, thereby ending the spread that began a million years earlier when ancestral members of the genus Homo first ventured out of Africa. But who were the first Americans? When did they arrive? Did they come in one migration or many? How quickly and by what adaptive strategies did they move across the environmentally diverse and trackless New World? How do they relate to contemporary native Americans? We have plenty of answers to these questions. Unfortunately, we can't agree which ones are right. This much is certain: the first Americans were Homo sapiens who came from northeast Asia via the Bering Straits (Fig. 1). They may have walked from Siberia to Alaska across Beringia, the land bridge formed when vast Pleistocene glaciers froze 5% of the world's water, 1 lowering global sea levels and exposing the shallow continental shelf between Asia and America. These hunter‐gatherers were present throughout the Americas by 11,500 years ago, in time to witness the climatic and ecological changes, including the extinction of thirty‐five genera of megafauna, that signalled the end of the Pleistocene. Beyond those bare facts there is controversy. Here, then, is a brief summary of the state of the argument over the peopling of the Americas. },

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite HIV therapy advances, average life expectancy in HIV-infected individuals on effective treatment is significantly decreased relative to uninfected persons, largely because of increased incidence of inflammation-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction. The enteric microbial community could potentially cause this inflammation, as HIV-driven destruction of gastrointestinal CD4 T cells may disturb the microbiota-mucosal immune system balance, disrupting the stable gut microbiome and leading to further deleterious host outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Varied enteric microbiome changes have been reported during HIV infection, but unifying patterns have emerged. Community diversity is decreased, similar to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and Clostridium difficile infection. Many taxa frequently enriched in HIV-infected individuals, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, have pathogenic potential, whereas depleted taxa, such as Bacteroidaceae and Ruminococcaceae, are more linked with anti-inflammatory properties and maintenance of gut homeostasis. The gut viral community in HIV has been found to contain a greater abundance of pathogenesis-associated Adenoviridae and Anelloviridae. These bacterial and viral changes correlate with increased systemic inflammatory markers, such as serum sCD14, sCD163, and IL-6.
SUMMARY: Enteric microbial community changes may contribute to chronic HIV pathogenesis, but more investigation is necessary, especially in the developing world population with the greatest HIV burden (Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/COID/A15, which includes the authors' summary of the importance of the work).},

 abstract = {Ma’anshan is a Paleolithic cave site in the Guizhou province of southern China. The total area of the excavations is ca. 48 m2, and the cultural deposit is divided into two layers representing the Chinese Late Paleolithic and the later part of the Early Paleolithic. The upper layer dates between 19,295  BP and 31,155 BP by AMS technique, and the lower layer is dated to around 53,000 BP by U-Series technique. Thousands of bone fragments were recovered from the two layers. Species abundance, bone surface modifications, skeletal element representation, and mortality patterns were studied in an investigation of assemblage formation history and patterns of prey selection and meat consumption by hominins. Interpretations of the faunal data are strengthened by reference to experimental studies and ethnoarchaeological data. The zooarchaeological data indicate that the later occupants of Ma’anshan Cave hunted mainly medium and small game animals, while the earlier occupants tended to prey upon larger animals. In the later period, hominins also made fuller use of the carcasses. The breadth of the meat diet increased with time, due to the inclusion of quick small animals (bamboo rats and birds) in the later period. The differences between the two faunal assemblages are consistent with the chronologic boundary currently drawn between the Chinese Early and Late Paleolithic ca. 30–27 ka BP, based on technological and other evidence.},

 abstract = {Human activity along the Galana River inside Tsavo National Park, Kenya extends from 6000 years BP until at least 1300 years BP. This time period in East Africa predates and includes the Pastoral Neolithic – geographically and temporally linked early cattle-herding cultures comprised of autonomous communities with loose cultural connections to one another. Data from some sites located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin and Central Kenyan Highlands indicate that after 3000 years BP, residential mobility patterns increased and pastoralists adopted a strong dependence on maintaining and culling herds of domesticated animals. This pattern is not borne out in Tsavo, where artefact analyses indicate that people had restricted mobility and relied primarily on exploitation of an endoaquatic resource base. This study hypothesises that subdecadal periodicity in El Niño/Southern Oscillation index (ENSO) along with a general trend toward aridification of East African landscapes provided the environmental backdrop for a subsistence regime focused primarily within riparian environments of the Coastal Lowlands region.},

 abstract = {El objetivo de este trabajo es discutir las implicaciones tafonmicas y arqueolgicas de episodios de mortalidad catastrfica de guanacos provocado por estrs invernal. Para ello se presentan los datos relevados en un sitio ubicado en la margen oeste del lago Cardiel. El conjunto faunstico fue caracterizado en funcin de las siguientes variables: estado de conservacin, estructura etaria, posicin de muerte, grado de enterramiento, grado de articulacin, la accin de carnvoros, pisoteo y la asociacin entre individuos y artefactos lticos. Se plantea que este tipo de eventos se presentan bajo determinadas condiciones que son normales en los ecosistemas del sur patagnico; asimismo, presentan una localizacin espacial predecible y redundante, fundamentalmente en lugares reparados. En trminos tafonmicos, esto implica un potencial de mezcla de acumulaciones naturales y culturales en lugares utilizados como reparo tanto por el hombre como por los guanacos. Al considerar el impacto de este tipo de mortalidad de animales en las poblaciones humanas, se sugiere que, en el corto plazo, genera una oferta importante de recursos explotable a travs de una estrategia de carroeo. Esta es una opcin poco costosa y de bajo riesgo (Borrero et al. 2005) que emplea una oferta inmediata que se presenta en una escala regional. Por estas razones, la implementacin del carroeo por parte de las poblaciones cazadoras recolectoras no slo sera esperable en momentos iniciales de poblamiento, sino que pudo ser sistemticamente utilizado a lo largo del tiempo. Por otra parte, debido a la baja diversidad que caracteriza a los ecosistemas del sur patagnico, la productividad de una regin puede variar enormemente en el largo plazo. De esta manera, las fluctuaciones en la biomasa animal generadas por este tipo de mortalidad puede ser un factor que regule el abandono de determinados espacios, fundamentalmente aquellos asociados con una alta variabilidad climtica como los cercanos a la cordillera. The aim of this paper is to present a case study that consists of an episode of catastrophic mortality of guanacos caused by winter stress in the west margin of Lago Cardiel (Santa Cruz, Argentina). The faunal assemblage is described in terms of the following variables: preservation state, age structure, death postures, degree of interment, disarticulation, carnivore marks, trampling, and association between carcasses and lithic artifacts. The taphonomic and archaeological implications of this kind of mortality events in guanacos are discussed. It is suggested that this kind of events occur under certain conditions which are normal in southern Patagonian ecosystems. Also, they show a predictable and redundant spatial location, mainly in sheltered places. In taphonomic terms, this implies a potential mixing of natural and cultural assemblages in places used as shelter by guanacos and humans. In terms of the impact of this kind of animal mortality events on human populations, it is suggested that, in the short term, they constitute an important supply of resources that is exploitable through a scavenging strategy. This is a low cost and low risk option (Borrero et al. 2005) which makes use of an immediate supply of the resource in question on a regional scale. Therefore, the implementation of a scavenging strategy by hunter-gatherers populations could be expected not only during the early peopling of the region, but also as a common strategy practiced through time. On the other hand, due to the low diversity that is characteristic of southern Patagonian environments, catastrophic death events can severely affect the productivity of a region in the long term. This implies, in turn, that the consequent fluctuations on animal biomass could constitute a factor controlling the abandonment of certain spaces, mainly those suffering a high climatic variability, such as areas near the Andean Cordillera.},

 abstract = {The knowledge that chimpanzees hunt vertebrates and share meat continues to fuel the imagination and grant proposals of many field researchers who study Pan. Hunting and food sharing have played an important role in constructing models of human origins (Dart 1953; Isaac 1978; Lovejoy 1981; Stanford ' Bunn, 2001). The presence of sharing in Pan helps us to speculate about how the last common ancestor of living apes and humans may have dealt with scarce and contested food resources (Marchant, in press). It was in 1963 that Jane Goodall published her findings revealing how powerfully meat figures in the lives of chimpanzees. More recently, we have also learned that bonobos are intensely interested in eating vertebrate flesh and share the prey (Ihobe 1992; Hohmann & Fruth 1993). The three chapters in this section provide new insights into both Pan species and enlarge our understanding of species differences and similarities. Boesch et al. discuss chimpanzee predation on red colobus monkeys (Chapter 16), sharpening our understanding of this predator–prey system, and adding more complexity to how we might model ancestral hominid hunting patterns. The chapter is unusual in providing a three-site comparison (Gombe and Mahale in East Africa, and Ta in West Africa) by the same observer (C. Boesch). Boesch (1994) studied chimpanzee hunting behavior at Gombe and Ta and here extends the analysis, while Uehara and Ihobe provide an update and further analysis of prey availability at Mahale (Uehara et al. 1992). We learn that demographic changes in either predator or prey may have a significant impact on hunting frequency, species targeted, and number of monkeys taken annually.},

 abstract = {The East African hominin Paranthropus boisei was characterized by a suite of craniodental features that have been widely interpreted as adaptations to a diet that consisted of hard objects that required powerful peak masticatory loads. These morphological adaptations represent the culmination of an evolutionary trend that began in earlier taxa such as Australopithecus afarensis, and presumably facilitated utilization of open habitats in the Plio-Pleistocene. Here, we use stable isotopes to show that P. boisei had a diet that was dominated by C(4) biomass such as grasses or sedges. Its diet included more C(4) biomass than any other hominin studied to date, including its congener Paranthropus robustus from South Africa. These results, coupled with recent evidence from dental microwear, may indicate that the remarkable craniodental morphology of this taxon represents an adaptation for processing large quantities of low-quality vegetation rather than hard objects.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT The “social insurance” hypothesis posits that individuals join cooperative groups and share resources in order to reduce environmental risk. Despite its significance for explaining cooperative groups' formation, in small‐scale and in developing societies, the hypothesis has been subjected to little experimental testing. The present research is designed to examine the relative weight of the motivation for social insurance compared with other psychological motivations for sharing risk. We conducted two studies to test the tendency to share risk under different risk conditions and for groups of different sizes. A third experiment extends the risk‐sharing research to situations involving losses instead of gains. The findings of the first two studies lend strong support to the risk‐sharing hypothesis in the gain domain. For the loss domain, the results of the third experiment demonstrate an intriguing shift from strong reluctance to join groups under lower risk, to ubiquitous readiness to join groups under higher risk. We discuss these results in light of prospect theory and decisions from experience. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {African trypanosomes, except Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which cause human African trypanosomiasis, are lysed by the human serum protein apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1). These two subspecies can resist human ApoL1 because they express the serum resistance proteins T. b. gambiense glycoprotein (TgsGP) and serum resistance-associated protein (SRA), respectively. Whereas in T. b. rhodesiense, SRA is necessary and sufficient to inhibit ApoL1, in T. b. gambiense, TgsGP cannot protect against high ApoL1 uptake, so different additional mechanisms contribute to limit this uptake. Here we report a complex interplay between trypanosomes and an ApoL1 variant, revealing important insights into innate human immunity against these parasites. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized an atypical T. b. gambiense infection in a patient in Ghana. We show that the infecting trypanosome has diverged from the classical T. b. gambiense strains and lacks the TgsGP defense mechanism against human serum. By sequencing the ApoL1 gene of the patient and subsequent in vitro mutagenesis experiments, we demonstrate that a homozygous missense substitution (N264K) in the membrane-addressing domain of this ApoL1 variant knocks down the trypanolytic activity, allowing the trypanosome to avoid ApoL1-mediated immunity.
IMPORTANCE: Most African trypanosomes are lysed by the ApoL1 protein in human serum. Only the subspecies Trypanosoma b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense can resist lysis by ApoL1 because they express specific serum resistance proteins. We here report a complex interplay between trypanosomes and an ApoL1 variant characterized by a homozygous missense substitution (N264K) in the domain that we hypothesize interacts with the endolysosomal membranes of trypanosomes.

 abstract = {We examine the larger mammals from late Middle Palaeolithic Kebara Cave (Israel), and offer eight principal conclusions concerning Neanderthal hunting activities at the site. (1) Regardless of prey size, most procurement was by hunting, not scavenging. The major prey were gazelle and fallow deer, but also aurochs, red deer, and boar. (2) Hunting was seasonal, with most hunts in winter and/or spring. (3) Hunters took male and female deer in similar numbers, but a preponderance of female gazelle. These sex ratios probably reflect local availability and encounter rates. (4) More juvenile deer than juvenile gazelle were taken. The frequency of juveniles has not been severely impacted by taphonomic processes. Because of their small size and limited body fat, juveniles were probably low-ranked resources by comparison to their adult counterparts and may often have been excluded from the hunters' optimal diet. If so, fluctuations in the numbers of juveniles do not track changes in hunting season, but instead indi...},

The question of how keeping pets at home affects the attitudes of children toward wild animals still has not been answered, due to various methodological issues, such as ignorance of some attitude dimensions and/or questionnaires that include items focused on very different animals. We conducted three independent research surveys (using three independent samples) of Slovakian primary school children aged 10 to 15 years (n = 1297). These surveys focused on the effects of keeping pets on the attitudes of children towards, and knowledge of, three unpopular animals in Slovakia. These animals were pests (potato beetle) (Study 1), predators (wolf) (Study 2), and those that pose a threat of disease to humans (mouse) (Study 3). Each survey also included a popular animal (ladybird beetle, rabbit, and squirrel, respectively), which served as a “control”; these were compared by pair-wise statistics. Results consistently showed that children had better knowledge of, but less favorable attitudes towards, unpopular animals compared with popular ones. Having pets at home was associated with more positive attitudes to, and better knowledge of, both popular and unpopular animals. Girls were less favorably inclined than boys to animals that may pose a threat, danger, or disease to them. Implications for humane education are discussed, especially in terms of keeping pets, the link between knowledge and attitudes, and children's understanding of ecological adaptations.},

The opposing Climate-Change hypothesis to explain extinctions is driven by ideology as much as by objective reasoning because it is repeated so frequently without strong new evidence to support it, but it has failed to nail down a victory in public opinion. Overkill, which is not an anti-climate-change hypothesis, is perhaps too “flexible” to persuade all scientists, especially because negative evidence (a lack of megafaunal killsites) is considered to be as corroborative as positive evidence. Multiphase models of extinctions that propose different genera died out at different times have become less and less likely as more radiometric dating is done, and overlook the documented variability in atmospheric radiocarbon around the end of the Pleistocene, which prevents the high resolution chronology-building necessary to support a discontinuous model of the extinctions. The extinctions were geologically abrupt, selective, and unique, and therefore they require unique explanations.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                  
                    The world’s first archaeological traces from 2.6 million years ago (Ma) at Gona, in Ethiopia, include sharp-edged cutting tools and cut-marked animal bones, which indicate consumption of skeletal muscle by early hominin butchers. From that point, evidence of hominin meat-eating becomes increasingly more common throughout the Pleistocene archaeological record. Thus, the substantive debate about hominin meat-eating now centers on mode(s) of carcass resource acquisition. Two prominent hypotheses suggest, alternatively, (1) that early
                    Homo
                    hunted ungulate prey by running them to physiological failure and then dispatching them, or (2) that early
                    Homo
                    was relegated to passively scavenging carcass residues abandoned by carnivore predators. Various paleontologically testable predictions can be formulated for both hypotheses. Here we test four predictions concerning age-frequency distributions for bovids that contributed carcass remains to the 1.8 Ma. old FLK 22
                    Zinjanthropus
                    (FLK Zinj, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) fauna, which zooarchaeological and taphonomic data indicate was formed predominantly by early
                    Homo
                    . In all but one case, the bovid mortality data from FLK Zinj violate test predictions of the endurance running-hunting and passive scavenging hypotheses. When combined with other taphonomic data, these results falsify both hypotheses, and lead to the hypothesis that early
                    Homo
                    operated successfully as an ambush predator.

 abstract = {Tierra del Fuego indigenous peoples (southernmost Argentinean and Chilean Patagonia) have been frequently accounted for since the 16th century; their weapons, however, were hardly described. Thus, this article aims to evaluate arrow technology variability in late 19th–early 20th century hunter-gatherer’s ethnographic samples from Tierra del Fuego. This proposal rests on previous archaeological studies which suggested a pattern of north–south morphometric variation in projectile points for the last 3000years, which follows a distribution that resembles the indigenous territories at historical times. However, a more limited chronological scale is needed to identify time-specific variations. 68 ethnographic arrows were thus surveyed at the Weltmuseum Wien (Austria), the Ethnologisches Museum (Germany) and the Musée du quai Branly (France) to test the existence of differences at the time. By means of multivariate statistics, the metrical comparison of the whole arrows, as well as the individual points and shafts, from land- and sea-resources specialized hunter-gatherers (Selk’nam/Yámana and Alacaluf, respectively) have revealed size differences. While Selk’nam arrows present longer and wider shafts, with smaller fletching and points, Alacaluf and Yámana arrows show the opposite trend. Results show that morphometric variations previously detected on archaeological projectile points are also present in the time-specific ethnographic arrows analyzed here, at least regarding size.},

 abstract = {From the moment of birth, each human being builds a microbe-host symbiosis which is key for the preservation of its health and well-being. This personal symbiotic coexistence is the result of progressive enrichments in microorganism diversity through external supplies. This diversity is nowadays massively overthrown by drastic changes related to clinical practice in birth management, environmental exposure, nutrition and healthcare behaviors. The last two generations have been the frame of massive modifications in life and food habits, with people being more and more sedentary, overfed and permeated with drugs and pollutants. We are now able to measure the impact of these changes on the gut microbiota diversity. Concomitantly, these modifications of lifestyle were associated with a dramatic increase in incidence of immune-mediated diseases including metabolic, allergic and inflammatory diseases and most likely neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Microbiota is becoming a hot topic in the scientific community and in the mainstream media. The number of scientific publications increased by up to a factor three over the last five years, with gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases being the most productive areas. In the intellectual property landscape, the patent families on microbiota have more than doubled in the meantime. In parallel, funding either from National Institutes (e.g. from NIH which funds research mainly in the field of allergies, infections, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, from the White House which launched the national microbiome initiative) or by pharmaceutical companies follow the same trend, showing a boost and a strong support in the research field on microbiota. All major health players are investing in microbiome research as shown by the number of deals signed and by funding during 2015. The Giens round table addressed how the medicine of tomorrow, considering human beings as a human-microbe symbiotic supraorganism, could leverage microbiome knowledge and tools. The rationale for our working group has been structured around four domains of innovation that could derive from ongoing efforts in deciphering the interactions between human cells and intestinal microbiome as a central component of human health, namely: (1) development of stratification and monitoring tools; (2) identification of new target and drug discovery, as a part of our supra-genome; (4) exploitation of microbiota as a therapeutic target that can be modulated; (4) and finally as a source of live biotherapeutics and adjuvants. These four streams will exemplify how microbiota has changed the way we consider a wide range of chronic and incurable diseases and the consequences of long-lasting dysbiosis. In-depth microbiota analysis is opening one of the broadest fields of investigation for improving human and animal health and will be a source of major therapeutic innovations for tackling today's medical unmet needs. We thus propose a range of recommendations for basic researchers, care givers as well as for health authorities to gain reliability in microbiome analysis and accelerate discovery processes and their translation into applications for the benefits of the people. Finally, les Ateliers de Giens round table on microbiota benefited from the richness of the French ecosystem. France represents a center of excellence in the microbiota research field, with French institutions as Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA [Metagenopolis, Micalis]), Centre national de la recherché scientifique (CNRS), Unité de recherche sur les maladies infectieuses et tropicales émergentes (URMITE), Institut of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition (ICAN), Institut des maladies métaboliques et cardiovasculaires (I2MC), Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm), Pasteur Institute and Gustave-Roussy being top-players for the number of publications.},

Previous research on social welfare attitudes has emphasized the role of political factors such as economic self‐interest and ideology. Here, we demonstrate that attitudes to social welfare are also influenced by short‐term fluctuations in hunger. Using theories in evolutionary psychology, we predict that hungry individuals will be greedier and take more resources from others while also attempting to induce others to share by signaling cooperative intentions and expressing support for sharing, including evolutionarily novel forms of sharing such as social welfare. We test these predictions using self‐reported hunger data as well as comparisons of subjects who participated in relevant online studies before and after eating lunch. Across four studies collected in two different welfare regimes—the U nited K ingdom and D enmark—we consistently find that hungry individuals act in a greedier manner but describe themselves as more cooperative and express greater support for social welfare. },

 abstract = {The character of degreased mammal bones scattered over modern East African landscapes is shown to provide a measure of competition among carnivores for fresh carcasses. The number of bones by which individuals are represented, skeletal part profiles, and the completeness of surviving bones are shown to differ among three settings: Ngorongoro Crater, the Acacia woodlands and grass plains of the Serengeti, and riparian woodlands of the Serengeti. These differences are correlated directly to the scale of scavenging opportunities previously documented for these ecosystems and habitats. The results are explicable through reference to the sequence in which spotted hyenas consume carcass parts, and their competitively-induced motivation to destroy bone before its edible contents decompose. The landscape assemblages provide a taphonomic model for estimating the degree of competition for carcasses in prehistoric settings. Such estimates are a prerequisite for assessing the frequency by which prehistoric hominids may have acquired and consumed food from scavenged carcasses.},

@article{pub.1038571656,
 abstract = {Aggression is defined as a mechanism of spacing by means of force or displays. It has evolved independently in different animal groups. The mechanisms underlying it are therefore not homologous throughout the animal kingdom. The phenomenon of aggression is so widespread, however, that strong selection pressures must be responsible for its development along analogous lines. Its most obvious functions are in competition for mates, natural resources, and territories, and in the preservation of group identity in many gregarious species. Aggression is often ritualized so that no damage is done to conspecifics. This ritualization may appear as modification of fighting into a tournament, or as the development of submissive postures which block further aggression in the opponent shortly after the onset of a potentially damaging fight. Animal aggression is preprogrammed by phylogenetic adaptation in well‐defined ways, but can be modified by experience. The inborn programs involve motor patterns, innate releasing mechanisms, releasers, motivating mechanisms, and learning dispositions specific for the species. Aggression on this biological level can be observed in humans as intragroup aggression. Certain motor patterns and signals which lead to the release of aggression are universal. Some can even be found in deaf‐ and blind‐born people, proving their innateness. A number of patterns of aggression in man are highly ritualized and ‐ in a way analogous to that found in many animals ‐ mechanisms of control have evolved inhibiting the killing of a conspecific. There are strong indications of the existence of motivating mechanisms within the brain, e.g., in the form of neuronal circuits, that show a degree of spontaneity. The type of destructive aggression which we call war, is a product of cultural evolution. War takes advantage of the given motivational structure of man, including his fear of strangers, which develops in every baby independently of experience and makes men inclined to form closed groups and causes them to be wary of or hostile to strangers. Based on these tendencies, man underwent a process of cultural subspeciation. Groups demarcated themselves from others by custom, erecting communication barriers. The development of languages demonstrates how fast and efficient this process is. Members of the same group, during this process, were defined as the “real man,” outsiders often were to be valued less ‐or even considered nonhuman. On the basis of this self‐indoctrination, cultural codes of conduct developed, which allowed members of other groups to be killed when groups competed for resources. A cultural fiiter of norms was established which demanded killing under defined conditions, and was superimposed upon the biological filter of norms which inhibits the killing of a human being. This results in a conflict of norms, which is universally felt as guilt, since the biological filter of norms, though superimposed, is nonetheless working, particularly in the circumstance of a personal encounter. The more advanced the technique of armament, which allows fast and distant killing, the less the inhibitions are activated. Nonetheless, ritualizations occur on the cultural level. Warfare is sometimes ritualized and conventions are developed to prevent escalation into massacres, or the wholesale destruction of the subjugated enemy. To a great extent, this is certainly a result of our inborn moral code, If nothing like this were given to man our situation would be disastrous indeed. Whether cultural evolution will, in the future, be guided by moral maxims in accord with our human nature is a deeision men must make rationally. Although a ruthless ethnocentrism may bring advantage to a warring group, this may eventually prove fatal to mankind as a whole. In the escalating competition mankind runs the danger not only of exhausting its resources, but of destroying itself with its new weapons. If the outcome were not selfdestruction but domination by one group it would impoverish the diversity of human cultures, and thus seriously cut down man's spectrum of adaptability. War fulfills certain functions, similar to those found in animals. It is mainly a mechanism for preserving and extending one's territory, and a means of getting access to scarce resources. It is therefore dangerous to consider war merely as a pathological form of human behavior because this may distract our attention from the fact that, h order to overcome war, the functions of war have to be fulfilled by nonviolent means. Cultural evolution phenocopies biological evolution, due to similarities in the selection pressures shaping its course. This allows us to define the point of the evolutionary spiral we are at currently and to predict our future course.},

 abstract = {Introduction It has been recognized for a long time that languages across a broad sub-Saharan belt from the western end of the continent to the escarpment of the Ethiopian Plateau in the east display certain linguistic affinities. At the same time, it has been difficult to identify precisely the nature and range of these affinities and to provide a plausible explanation for them. I propose in Güldemann (2003a) that the distribution of logophoric marking in Africa follows an areal pattern in that it is regularly found in languages of the sub-Saharan belt referred to above, but is virtually absent from the rest of the continent. This finding is the starting point for a more systematic investigation of the following questions: Does this geographical region share other linguistic traits? If so, do these define some sort of linguistic area? If so, how has this area come into being? I present in section 5.2 several linguistic features which appear to share a roughly similar distribution across the African continent, as well as additional candidate features which may support the evidence provided in this chapter. Section 5.3 briefly surveys previous approaches to the general observation of linguistic commonalities across the sub-Saharan belt, among which there is the proposal that most of the languages involved belong to a genealogical lineage comprising Greenberg's super-groups Niger-Kordofanian and Nilo-Saharan.},

 abstract = {Abstract  One of the common assumptions in the study of the evolution of parental care is that trade‐offs exist between parental investment and other fitness‐related traits. In general, this body of work follows the traditional definition that parental investment (in the current offspring) decreases that individual’s ability to invest in future reproduction ( Trivers 1972 ). However, examination of the empirical evidence shows that assuming a trade‐off between parental and mating effort is not always appropriate. This overemphasis on a trade‐off between mating and parental effort has arisen in part because of an oversimplification of female reproductive strategies, a failure to consider interactions between the sexes, and a tendency to consider behaviours as unifunctional, thereby ignoring the more complex relationship between mating and parental effort in many species. Here, we first examine the empirical evidence for trade‐offs between mating and parental effort in males and females to ask when trade‐offs occur and what pattern they take. By highlighting a number of exemplar species, we then explore how the presence or absence of trade‐offs relates to mate choice and sexual selection in both sexes. Finally, we highlight the importance of considering individual variation, which has been particularly overlooked in examinations of female investment, and how preferences in one sex may influence the existence and our interpretation of apparent trade‐offs in the other sex. },

 abstract = {Recent archaeological research has fundamentally altered our understanding of the scope of past human impacts on nondomesticated animal populations. Predictions derived from foraging theory concerning the abundance histories of high-return human prey and diet breadth have been met in many parts of the world. People are known to have introduced a broad variety of nondomesticated animals, from sponges to agoutis and rats, to a remarkably broad set of contexts, in turn causing a wide variety of secondary impacts. By increasing the incidence of fire, human colonists have in some cases transformed the nature of the vegetation on the colonized landscape, in turn dramatically affecting animal populations on those landscapes. In island settings, these triple threats--predation, biotic introductions, and vegetation alteration--routinely led to extinctions but there is no archaeological evidence that small-scale societies caused extinction by predation alone on islands or continents. Indeed, the recent history of this famous argument suggests that it is better seen as a statement of faith about the past rather than as an appeal to reason. Perhaps most importantly, our burgeoning knowledge of past human impacts on animals has important implications for the conservation biology of the future.},

The data appear to suggest that they come to perform predation frequently in recent years. However, for evaluating long-term changes in their predatory disposition, several factors must be considered, such as changes in research formation, in the degree of habituation of the chimpanzees and in the influence of humans on prey animals. These factors should be also considered when the findings of various populations are compared.It seems that an adult male can more easily control his desire for exclusive possession of meat than that of plant-food. Adult males have priority over females in obtaining meat, but all of the former cannot join the meat-eating cluster. Besides the dominance rank, dyadic relationships between them may regulate whether an adult male can join it. This suggests that all adult males in a unit-group may not be tied by an equal bond.The evolutionary implications of chimpanzee predation are discussed on the basis of the assumption that both chimpanzee predation and human hunting originated in some habit of a common ancestor.},

 abstract = { The late Pleistocene expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) into Eurasia and the concurrent demise of the Neanderthals appears to be a complex and regionally variable process. The southern Caucasus region, with its rich cave-sites, has recently provided important results regarding this process. In this paper we report on the results of fieldwork in Bondi Cave, Western Georgia, providing a new radiocarbon chronology, stratigraphic observations, analyses of lithic technology and provenance, faunal and floral remains as well as paleoenvironmental data. The cave includes Middle Palaeolithic (ca, 45,000 ka cal. BP) cultural horizons and a long Upper Palaeolithic sequence (ca. 40,000–27,000 cal. BP from layer V to IV). A modern human tooth was found in layer Vb. We estimate its age at 39,000–35,800 Cal BP (95.4%), based on the Bayesian age model we built. If the context of the tooth is reliable, as we think it is, this would make it the oldest morphologically modern human in the Caucasus. Upper Palaeolithic hunting of tur and bison, as well as the collection of various plants including flax is attested. Mobile Upper Palaeolithic foragers inhabited the cave in generally cold and dry periods, but a mosaic of environments, including forests and meadows, was nonetheless available to them. The archaeological sequence of Bondi and adjacent sites indicates a substantial time gap between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic occupations, thus disproving Neanderthal-AMH interaction in this area and lending support to a replacement scenario in the southern Caucasus, assuming of course that the Early Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) is related to the arrival of AMHs.},

 abstract = {The influence of climate change on human settlements in coastal areas is a central question for archaeologists. This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the Témara region in Morocco. The study area was selected for two main reasons. First, it contains numerous caves with Upper Pleistocene deposits, which have yielded remains of anatomically modern humans in association with Aterian and Iberomaurusian artifacts. Second, these caves are currently located on the shore, thus this region is particularly sensitive to major climate change and sea level fluctuations. Diachronic taphonomic study of faunal remains from two sites in the region, El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, shows alternating human/non-human predator occupations. The lower layers of El Mnasra Cave dating to Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5 have yielded diverse ungulate remains with significant anthropogenic impact marks, together with numerous mollusk shells, Nassarius shell beads, hearths, lithics, some bone tools and used pigments. Faunal remains from the upper layers dating to OIS 4, 3 and 2 of El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, largely dominated by gazelles, provide evidence of carnivore activities, such as tooth marks, numerous semi-digested bones and coprolites alongside some anthropogenic signatures (cut marks and burnt bones). Non-human predators appear to be the main agents responsible for faunal modifications and accumulations. The 'non-intensive' nature of human occupation is confirmed by analyses of the lithic industry at El Harhoura 2. The 'intensive' human occupations date to OIS 5 and could have taken place during wet periods in connection with high sea levels, which allowed the exploitation of shellfish in this area. 'Non-intensive' human occupations generally correspond to arid periods and lower sea levels, during which the Témara area was further inland and may have been less attractive to humans. },

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the microbiota of both obese animals and humans there is an increased ratio of the gram positive Firmicutes to the gram negative Bacteroidetes (the obesity pattern). To assess if altering this ratio in animals and humans would prevent obesity or reduce body weight in the obese subject this review was preformed.
METHODS: A survey of all the available English language literature utilizing Medline on this topic was obtained and critically reviewed. The key words that were utilized were gut microbiota, diet and obesity.
RESULTS: In both humans and animals changes in diet, particularly the utilization of the high fat, high calorie Western diet, utilization of artificial sweeteners and disruption of the diurnal rhythm will quickly change the microbiota from a thin to an obese pattern. In animals, the transfer of an obese microbiota to germ free animals and thin animals results in obesity and the introduction of a lean microbiota will result in weight loss in obese animals. However, in humans similar changes in the gut microbiota induced with probiotics and prebiotics have not been shown to result in weight loss. In both animals and humans the most dramatic changes in the gut microbiota occur following weight loss resulting from a gastric bypass where there is a restoration to a normal Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. These changes could either be due to the dramatic change in the composition of the diet which occurs following this surgery or due to down-regulation of the Farnesoid X Receptor which causes a decrease in bile acid production and an elevation of the gut pH which in turn allows the regrowth of bacteria associated with weight loss which were previously unable to grow in the acidic intestinal environment caused by excess production of bile acids.
CONCLUSION: In both humans and animals there are characteristic changes in the gut microbiota associated with obesity. In animals but not in humans altering the microbiota can result in weight loss and weight gain which does not occur in humans. This suggests that in humans the changes in gut microbiota are an association with rather than the cause of obesity.},

To help establish the foundations of such a science, we explore three traditions of mathematical theory: the Lotka–Volterra interactions of ecological theory, niche construction models of population genetics, and theory from the gene–culture coevolution tradition. We review the theoretical tools of each of these traditions in explaining cultural articulation with the environment. Although the theoretical core of the science we propose does not exist, cultural evolutionary theory supplies useful tools to analyse endogenous culture, cultural dynamics, and deeply rooted behavioural links to the environment. We also present a coupled model for demonstration, and suggest that coupled socio‐ecological models can provide a formal theory to help address the emergent socio‐ecological problems of the future.},

 abstract = {Mortality profiles have figured prominently among tools used by zooarchaeologists to investigate relationships between hominids and prey species. Their analysis and interpretation have been considerably influenced by M.C. Stiner's approach based on ternary diagrams. Part of this method included the demarcation of “zones” in ternary diagrams identifying specific mortality patterns (e.g. attritional, catastrophic, prime-dominated, etc.). Since its introduction some twenty-five years ago, this zoning has, however, received little critical attention. Mathematical modelling as well as a reassessment of the ecological data used to define these zones reveal several problems that may bias interpretations of mortality profiles on ternary diagrams.Here we propose new, mathematically supported definitions for the zoning of ternary diagrams combined with species-specific age class boundaries based on ethological and ontological data for seven of the most common hominid prey (bison, red deer, reindeer, horse, zebras, African buffalo and common eland). We advocate for the use of new areas (JPO, JOP, O and P zones) that produce more valid interpretations of the relative abundance of juveniles, prime and old adults in an assemblage. These results contribute to the improvement of the commonly used method of mortality profile analysis first advanced by M.C. Stiner.},

In this paper we present new evidence of anthropophagic behaviour amongst hunter-gatherer groups of the Mediterranean Mesolithic. A total of 30 human remains with anthropic manipulation marks have been found in the Mesolithic layers of Coves de Santa Maira (Castell de Castells, Alicante, Spain), dating from ca. 10.2–9cal ky BP. We describe the different marks identified on both human and faunal remains at the site (lithic, tooth, percussion and fire marks on bone cortex). As well as describing these marks, and considering that both human and faunal remains at the site present similar depositional and taphonomic features, this paper also contextualizes them within the archaeological context and subsistence patterns described for Mesolithic groups in the region. We cannot entirely rule out the possibility that these practices may be the result of periodic food stress suffered by the human populations. These anthropophagic events at the site coincide with a cultural change at the regional Epipalaeolithic-Mesolithic transition.},

Although bipedal gaits include walking and running, running is generally considered to have played no major role in human evolution because humans, like apes, are poor sprinters compared to most quadrupeds. Here we assess how well humans perform at sustained long-distance running, and review the physiological and anatomical bases of endurance running capabilities in humans and other mammals. Judged by several criteria, humans perform remarkably well at endurance running, thanks to a diverse array of features, many of which leave traces in the skeleton. The fossil evidence of these features suggests that endurance running is a derived capability of the genus Homo, originating about 2 million years ago, and may have been instrumental in the evolution of the human body form.},

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens.},

 abstract = {A detailed taphonomic analysis is reported for a sample of the larger mammalian faunal assemblage (>4.5 kg live body weight) from Blombos Cave. The analysis provides an assessment of human involvement in the accumulation and modification of the faunal assemblage, and precedes equally detailed analyses and separate reports of Middle Stone Age (MSA) butchery, transport, and hunting behaviour. At Blombos, there are clear differences in the relative abundances of ungulate body size classes, with the lower MSA phases (upper/lower M2 and M3) showing a high representation of size 1 ungulates relative to the most recent MSA phase (M1). The bones from the earliest MSA phase (M3) have not undergone much post-depositional fragmentation, in contrast to fragments from more recent phases (M1 and upper M2). Much of this variability can be attributed to more burning activity and trampling during M1 and upper M2, which could indicate more intensive occupation. Bone surfaces are variably preserved, with high levels of exfoliation in the most recent two phases. Surface modification analyses revealed high proportions of human modification throughout the sequence, indicating that MSA humans were responsible for accumulating most of the larger mammals. After discard, the bones were modified by scavenging carnivores, leading to a moderate amount of density-mediated destruction and tooth-marking. Carnivores independently accumulated some of the smaller ungulates, mainly in the form of partially-digested remains. Raptorial birds are not implicated as major faunal accumulators. The results from Blombos are directly comparable with analogous datasets from two other sites in the Western Cape (Pinnacle Point Cave 13B and Die Kelders Cave 1). Such comparisons demonstrate that MSA faunal assemblages from nearby coastal sites have complex and different taphonomic histories both within and between sites. Because the human occupants were a major part of these processes, MSA subsistence behaviour and site use was also quite variable over time and space.},

 abstract = {When and how humans began to control fire has been a central debate in Paleolithic archaeology for decades. Fire plays an important role in technology, social organization, subsistence, and manipulation of the environment and is widely seen as a necessary adaptation for the colonization of northern latitudes. Many researchers view purported hearths, burnt wooden implements, and heated flints from Schöningen as providing the best evidence for the control of fire in the Lower Paleolithic of Northern Europe. Here we present results of a multianalytical study of the purported hearths along with a critical examination of other possible evidence of human use or control of fire at Schöningen. We conclude that the analyzed features and artifacts present no convincing evidence for human use or control of fire. Our study also shows that a multianalytical, micro-contextual approach is the best methodology for evaluating claims of early evidence of human-controlled fire. We advise caution with macroscopic, qualitative identification of combustion features, burnt flint, and burnt wood without the application of such techniques as micromorphology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, organic petrology, luminescence, and analysis of mineral magnetic parameters. The lack of evidence for the human control of fire at Schöningen raises the possibility that fire control was not a necessary adaptation for the human settlement of northern latitudes in the Lower Paleolithic.},

 abstract = {In recent years there has been much disagreement over the nature of carnivore involvement in Early Pleistocene zooarchaeological assemblages. This partially reflects the lack of reliable ways to identify the taphonomic signatures of different large carnivore taxa. It is often unclear which carnivore taxon or taxa may have played a role in forming or modifying faunal assemblages found associated with stone tools, and this lack of clarity impacts reconstructions of hominin behavior. The mode, frequency and nutritional yield of carcasses acquired by hominins, and the extent to which hominin foraging impinged on or was constrained by the guild of large predators are topics of great importance. This paper characterizes the taphonomic signature of large felids using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) image analysis method to study tooth marking and gross bone damage on neotaphonomic experiments carried out with tigers (Panthera tigris) and African lions (Panthera leo) at the Carolina Tiger Rescue (Pittsboro, North Carolina). This sample of over 400 bones significantly increases the size of current neotaphonomic samples modeling felid feeding traces, more than doubling the number of felid-modified specimens described in the literature. We identify a typical pattern of bone damage resulting from large felid carcass modification, which can be distinguished from bone damage patterns produced by hyaenids and canids. In summary, this pattern consists of tooth marking largely restricted to limb bone ends and minimal bone fragmentation. The frequency of tooth marking imparted by large felids in this study is lower than that produced by hyaenids, while canid tooth mark frequencies fall between the two. Investigation of the FLK Zinj assemblage from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has documented several specimens with surface damage similar to our neotaphonomic sample. This may signal early access to carcasses through 'power scavenging' by hominins. },

 abstract = {Recent excavations at the cave site of Roc de Marsal (in the Dordogne region of SW France) have yielded several Mousterian assemblages rich in well-preserved faunal remains. The Layer 4 faunal assemblage, associated with a rich Quina Mousterian occupation, provides an opportunity to investigate Neandertal prey selection, transport decisions and reindeer carcass processing strategies. One of the most striking characteristics of the Roc de Marsal Layer 4 faunal assemblage is an apparent lack of spongy parts that cannot be explained by taphonomic processes or carnivore activities. Limb elements were selectively transported to the site, where they underwent considerable further processing, resulting in a notably high degree of fragmentation of almost all elements. Comparison of reindeer carcass processing strategies employed by Neandertals during the Quina Mousterian with those identified for the later periods of the Upper Palaeolithic gives rise to some unexpected interpretations of Neandertal consumption behaviours. We show that this kind of intensive fragmentation is associated with bone grease rendering in ethnographic and Upper Palaeolithic contexts, in most such cases with the aid of fire. However, evidence of fire is remarkably scarce in Roc de Marsal Layer 4. Layer 4 could reflect a systematic Neandertal practice of sucking and chewing on the spongy portions of bones in order to extract as much of the highly nutritious bone grease as possible. Additionally, Roc de Marsal Layer 4 shows examples of use of animal resources for non-alimentary purposes by Neandertals. The abundance of cutmarks on the anterior surfaces of reindeer metapodials seems to indicate the acquisition of tendons, and bones were frequently used as retouchers.},

 abstract = {Male relationships in most species of mammals generally are characterized by intense intrasexual competition, with little bonding among unrelated individuals. In contrast, human societies are characterized by high levels of cooperation and strong bonds among both related and unrelated males. The emergence of cooperative male-male relationships has been linked to the multilevel structure of traditional human societies. Based on an analysis of the patterns of spatial and social interaction in combination with genetic relatedness data of wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio), we show that this species exhibits a multilevel social organization in which males maintain strong bonds and are highly tolerant of each other. Several "units" of males with their associated females form "parties," which team up as "gangs." Several gangs of the same "community" use the same home range. Males formed strong bonds predominantly within parties; however, these bonds were not correlated with genetic relatedness. Agonistic interactions were relatively rare and were restricted to a few dyads. Although the social organization of Guinea baboons resembles that of hamadryas baboons, we found stronger male-male affiliation and more elaborate greeting rituals among male Guinea baboons and less aggression toward females. Thus, the social relationships of male Guinea baboons differ markedly from those of other members of the genus, adding valuable comparative data to test hypotheses regarding social evolution. We suggest that this species constitutes an intriguing model to study the predictors and fitness benefits of male bonds, thus contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of this important facet of human social behavior. },

 abstract = {This chapter discusses the methods to determine the size, density, and growth rate of human populations. It also presents the use of demographic variables in archaeological explanation. Demographic archaeology is one of the exciting developments in contemporary archaeology. The relationship between population and culture can no longer be ignored. Questions of human ecology and adaptation, which are central to the discussions in archaeology, cannot be answered adequately without examining the role of demographic variables. Many of the demographic models, recently advanced in archaeology to explain some of the major events in the human past, have centered on the concept of population pressure. However, the theoretical weakness of this concept is becoming obvious, leading to a more critical and reserved view of the role of uncontrolled population increase. The construction of demographic models for explanatory purposes in archaeology should not be attempted without taking into consideration the various demographic factors that influence age- and sex-specific fertility and mortality, and without considering some of the basic demographic concepts on population structure and migration. With an adequate knowledge of demographic theory, the archaeologist should seek to improve his methodology to obtain the demographic information that is essential for formulating hypotheses and testing them.},

 abstract = { ABSTRACT  Previous cross‐cultural studies of religion's evolution that employed Swanson's High Gods measure are plagued by methodological difficulties, especially the lack of proper statistical controls. Here, we attempted to rectify this, using the Standard Cross‐Cultural Sample to test five hypotheses employing multivariate statistical techniques. Results provided weak support for Swanson's Sovereign Groups hypothesis concerning High Gods and also limited support for a previously unexplored factor: writing and record keeping. In phase two of the study, we introduced a new measure, the Stage of Religious Evolution, based on Anthony Wallace's typology. When this new dependent variable was substituted for High Gods, much stronger results were obtained. The best predictors of Stage of Religious Evolution were mode of subsistence economy, writing and record keeping, and total population size. These findings allowed us to construct a new evolutionary interpretation of the development of different modes of religious life. },

 abstract = {Need-based transfers are a widespread form of human cooperation across cultures that enhance survival in marginal environments. Examples include central place food sharing among foragers and stock friendships among pastoralists. Previous models have demonstrated that such systems lead to higher rates of herd survival under volatile ecological conditions, such as those experienced by the Maasai of East Africa. The Maasai use a need-based transfer system called osotua that leads to risk pooling. Here we implement osotua-style asking and giving rules on a network in order to understand which network features promote herd survival. We find that (1) greater network size increases herd survival when individuals selectively ask their wealthiest partner for livestock but not when they ask a partner at random, (2) greater network connectedness improves herd survival regardless of whether individuals ask their wealthiest partner or ask a partner at random, (3) greater network heterogeneity leads to higher herd survival with selective asking of wealthy partners and decreases herd survival for random asking. In general, selective asking of wealthy partners is associated with higher rates of herd survival. We also examined the features of survival networks in order to understand the characteristics of the networks that result from 50 simulated years of osotua-style sharing under ecologically volatile conditions and the elimination of individuals who do not stay above sustainability threshold. These results will help inform further fieldwork on the need-based transfer systems and increase our understanding of features of sharing networks that enable risk pooling. Simple decentralized sharing rules can be highly effective for pooling risk, suggesting that complex cultural institutions may not be necessary for expansion into ecologically marginal environments.},

Together, these suggest flavor perception is partially holistic, with odor and taste forming a common sensory channel in the mouth. One reason for this mode of perception is food choice. Flavor memories can support the identification of nutritious food via: (1) recovery of the flavor percept—thus including taste and somatosensory experiences—via sniffing; (2) visual priming of flavor expectancies; and (3) affective reaction to flavor, reflecting the effects of previous bouts of ingestion (eg, sickness). These allow food acceptability to be assessed prior to ingestion, as well as supporting the detection of adulterated food.},

 abstract = {The objective of this paper is twofold. It intends to reformulate the assumptions of interpretive archaeology and within this context to elaborate the framework within which one can study social and symbolic relationships between humans and animals in the prehistoric farming communities of Central Europe. Postprocessual archaeology has failed to provide a satisfactory account of how to judge the credibility of competing issues about the past. In the interpretive approach to animal bone assemblages, it is argued that the results of actualistic studies justify this credibility. The objective of actualistic studies is to establish how, when, and by whom the archaeological record has been produced. Credibility is also provided by the biological characteristics of animals maintained and consumed. The first level of credibility is a prerequisite to a further interpretation of the social dimensions of human action with respect to animals. The second level of interpretation is based on the horizontal distribution of archaeological pasts within and between sites.},

Within-population variation has been less well studied, especially within industrial societies. Moreover, little is known about the extent to which community-level variation in Dictator Game behaviour relates to community-level variation in real-world social behaviour. We chose two neighbourhoods of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne that were similar in most regards, but at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of level of socioeconomic deprivation. We administered Dictator Games to randomly-selected residents, and also gathered a large number of more naturalistic measures of cooperativeness. There were dramatic differences in Dictator Game behaviour between the two neighbourhoods, with the mean allocation to the other player close to half the stake in the affluent neighbourhood, and close to one tenth of the stake in the deprived neighbourhood. Moreover, the deprived neighbourhood was also characterised by lower self-reported social capital, higher frequencies of crime and antisocial behaviour, a higher frequency of littering, and less willingness to take part in a survey or return a lost letter. On the other hand, there were no differences between the neighbourhoods in terms of the probability of helping a person who dropped an object, needed directions to a hospital, or needed to make change for a coin, and people on the streets were less likely to be alone in the deprived neighbourhood than the affluent one. We conclude that there can be dramatic local differences in cooperative behaviour within the same city, and that these need further theoretical explanation.},

 abstract = {In the post-war years, Americans migrated en masse into suburbs punctuated by shopping centers that served as social and recreational hubs. Concerned about the civic wellbeing of shopping-centered suburbanites, a group called the Agora Coalition formed in the 1990s to enhance malls' civic functioning through a combination of design and programming strategies. This paper presents an adversarial alternative to such an approach. Rather than working "with" the mall as its prodding civic conscience, the paper recommends strategizing "against" it on behalf of civic life. The paper reveals four vulnerabilities in malls that such thinking can exploit: mall users may not find malls ego-enhancing places in which to socialize; the current economic recession has pointed up that many mall goods are frivolous nonessentials; malls are less likely to engender topophilia than are local public landscapes; and, as successful retail institutions in a competitive capitalist environment, malls employ successful strategies for gaining customers that designers of civic spaces can emulate. Indeed, the adversarial, zero-sum approach recommended here exemplifies the use of market-honed, "mall" strategizing. To nurture such thinking, I refer to Sun-Tzu's classic treatise The Art of War . The 2,400-year old text is required reading in MBA programs nationwide and presumably informs the thinking of many who build and manage malls. What would these people do if they were now competing against their creations on behalf of civic life?},

 abstract = {Estimation of stature is an important parameter in identification of commingled, mutilated and skeletal remains in forensic examinations. Bilateral asymmetry is defined as the difference between the measurements of the left and right sides of the human body. While estimating stature from skeletal material as well as from body parts in forensic anthropology case work, asymmetry of the human body may result in erroneous estimates due to bilateral variations present in dimensions of the human body and bones. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate asymmetry in upper and lower extremity dimensions in a north Indian population and to see its effect on the estimation of stature from these dimensions. The study was based on a sample of right-handed 967 adult male Gujjars, an endogamous group of North India. Bilateral asymmetry was assessed in six limb dimensions i.e. total upper extremity length, upper arm length, forearm length, hand length, total lower extremity length and lower leg length using a paired t-test. The results indicated that statistical significant bilateral asymmetry exists in total upper extremity length, upper arm length, forearm length, total lower extremity length and lower leg length (p<0.01). Correlation coefficients of various dimensions of upper and lower extremities with stature were found to be highly significant (p<0.001). Regression equations were calculated for estimation of stature from these limb dimensions using both left and right sides. The study concludes that there is a higher possibility of obtaining erroneous results while estimating stature from those body dimensions which show statistically significant bilateral asymmetry when formula developed from one side is used on the other side. Although, there seems to be a little possibility of obtaining erroneous results while estimating stature from those body dimensions which showed statistically insignificant asymmetry, it is strongly recommended that the examiner must first identify the side to which the limb part or bone belongs to, and then apply the appropriate formula derived for that particular side.},

 abstract = {The identification of human butchery-signatures on fauna from Lower Palaeolithic sites is well documented and readily identifiable. Such bone surface modifications have the potential to provide not only information about past hominin meat-procurement behaviour but address the wider issue of competition for resources with other carnivore species. To understand and discuss these broader issues both hominin and natural bone surface modifications must be understood and contextualised within a site-specific spatial and temporal framework. This paper presents new results from faunal analysis at two key British Lower Palaeolithic localities: Boxgrove and Swanscombe. It illustrates that different depositional environments and excavation histories have resulted in different scales and resolutions of available data and hence in varying interpretive potentials. At Swanscombe the archaeological record has been disturbed by both fluvial activity and excavation history providing a coarser-grained record of anthropogenic behaviour than previously acknowledged. Conversely, at Boxgrove, a finer-grained, higher resolution record of human behaviours has been preserved; this, combined with both an extensive and intensive excavation strategy, has allowed for a broader discussion of hominin landscape use, resource competition and meat-procurement behaviour. This paper highlights that assessing the specific depositional environment at each site is crucial to understanding Palaeolithic faunal assemblage formation and, consequently, the available data-resolution and behavioural interpretation.},

We then examine seven ungulate assemblages from the early Upper Palaeolithic site of Le Flageolet I (Dordogne, France) in this light, and show that these assemblages incorporate distinctly different relationships between numbers of specimens and numbers of taxa. While some of the differences involved may be caused by differential specimen fragmentation, the entire pattern of similarities and differences in richness appears to reflect changing maximum diet breadths through time.},

The northern area of the Iberian Peninsula has become a place of remarkable importance for these studies, particularly the Cantabrian cave of Esquilleu, which provides valuable information as well as new dates for understanding the situation at the end of the European Mousterian. The areas used by the last Neanderthals in Esquilleu demonstrate the exploitation of local resources as well as short and sporadic occupations. In this paper we consider these issues from a zooarchaeological and taphonomical perspective and propose an alternative explanation for the unexpected dating for a final Mousterian occupation in the cave: the significance of carnivores in the upper levels may explain this anomalous chronology.},

 abstract = {Pleistocene level TD6-2 of the Gran Dolina site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) is the result of anthropogenic accumulation. Hominin groups occupied the cave as a home base, where they brought in, butchered and consumed the carcasses of ungulates and other hominins. In this paper, we reassess the role of carnivores in the formation and/or modification of the assemblage. We employed different methods to explore the scenario in which the TD6-2 assemblage was formed: (1) identifying the actor responsible for tooth marks; (2) determining the frequency of carnivore tooth marks and their distribution; (3) identifying the co-occurrence of modifications (butchering marks and carnivore tooth marks); (4) calculating the percentage of change and the epiphysis to shaft ratio. Carnivore tooth marks are scarce, as is the co-occurrence of hominin and carnivore modifications. However, not all tooth marks have been attributed to a particular agent due to the high equifinality between human and carnivore tooth marks. For these reasons, the frequency of tooth marks and the co-occurrence of modifications have been of little help in interpreting the role of carnivores.Axial skeletal remains and the epiphyses of the long bones are in large part missing. The percentage of change and the epiphysis to shaft ratio suggest moderate carnivore ravaging activity. Our data indicate that the role of carnivores in TD6-2 seems to have had an impact on the original assemblage after hominins had extracted a large amount of nutrients from the carcasses. Cannibalized hominin remains showed no carnivore tooth marks and have a greater presence of low survival bones compared to ungulate remains. These findings point to a different taphonomic history suggesting that TD6-2 represents a succession of settlements having different characteristics.},

 abstract = {The concept of sustainable complex triangular cells may be applied to an individual of any human society. This concept was introduced in two recent articles. A case study was proposed to show the applicability of this new concept to Indian populations without contact with civilization and with a low environmental impact. Here we propose to apply this concept to a recent study, which claims that the concept of “common but differentiated responsibilities” refers to the emissions of individuals instead of nations. The income distribution of a country was used to estimate how its fossil fuel CO2 emissions are distributed among its citizens and, from that a global CO2 distribution was constructed. We propose the extension of the concept of complex triangular cells where its area would be equivalent to the CO2 emission per individual. In addition, a new three-dimensional geometric model for the regular hexagonal structure is offered in which the sharing of natural resources (human cooperation) is employed to reduce CO2 emissions in two scenarios by 2030.},

 abstract = {The Middle Stone Age (MSA) sediments of Porc-Epic Cave near Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, have produced a large assemblage of archaeofaunal remains dating to the later periods of the Late Pleistocene. As one of the few MSA faunal assemblages from East Africa subject to detailed analysis, it provides rare insight into the foraging behavior of the early modern humans in this region. The MSA fauna include taxa that were not historically present in the area, with the occurrence of reduncines and alcelaphines indicating widespread grasslands and proximity to a perennial source of water. The faunal analysis examined several lines of evidence, including breakage patterns, surface modification, and skeletal-element representation. By incorporating comparisons with multiple actualistic data sets, the analysis of the assemblage demonstrates that, while the influence of carnivores and other biotic agents was evident, the faunal remains were accumulated primarily by hominid activity. The skeletal-element representation at Porc-Epic includes an abundance of high utility bones, in contrast to the predominance of "head-and-foot" elements documented at other MSA and Middle Paleolithic (MP) sites. The MSA occupants of Porc-Epic effectively exploited a wide range of prey with more emphasis on small- and medium-sized mammals.},

 abstract = {Determining the extent to which hominid- and carnivore-derived components of fossil bone palimpsests formed independently of each other can provide valuable information to paleoanthropologists interested in reconstructing the foraging adaptations of hominids. Because stone tool cutmarks, hammerstone percussion marks, and carnivore tooth marks are usually only imparted on bone during nutrient extraction from a carcass, these bone surface modifications are particularly amenable to the types of analyses that might meet this goal. This study compares the percentage of limb bone specimens that preserve evidence of both hominid- and carnivore-imparted bone damage from actualistic control samples and several Plio-Pleistocene archaeofaunas, including new data from Swartkrans Member 3 (South Africa). We argue that this procedure, which elucidates the degree of hominid-carnivore independence in assemblage formation, will allow researchers to extract for focused analyses high integrity components (hominid and carnivore) from presumably low integrity sites. Comparisons suggest that the hominid- and carnivore-derived components from sites in Olduvai Gorge Bed II (Tanzania), the ST Site Complex at Peninj (Tanzania), and Swartkrans Member 3 formed largely independent of each other, while data from the FLK 22 Zinjanthropus (FLK Zinj) site (Olduvai Gorge Bed I) indicate significant interdependence in assemblage formation. This contrast suggests that some Early Stone Age assemblages (e.g., the Olduvai Gorge Bed II sites, the Peninj ST Site Complex, and Swartkrans Member 3) are probably more useful than others (e.g., FLK Zinj) for assessing the maximal carcass-acquiring abilities of early hominids; in such assemblages as those in the former set, sole hominid-contribution is more confidently discerned and isolated for analysis than in assemblages such as FLK Zinj.},

Extensive lithic and faunal assemblages were retrieved from several levels of the archaeological site. TK is located at the exposed top of Olduvai's Bed II, recently dated to 1.353 ± 0.035 Ma. From a geo-archaeological perspective, the stratigraphic studies have provided a redefinition of the processes involved in the site's formation.This paper offers a geological interpretation that revises and amends previous ones. The new interpretation focuses particularly on the technological and paleoeconomic study of a new lithic assemblage recovered from the lower occupation level (TKLF). This assemblage comprises 5805 objects in total, including 3812 items of shatter. We analyse here the chaînes opératoires represented in this level, as well as the processes implied by the raw materials, management, maintenance and abandonment of the lithic assemblage.The character of the site, as well as the activities carried out in it, have been greatly influenced by the proximity of the sources of the raw material primarily used, which could have been extracted from an inselberg of a particular type of quartzite located within a few hundred meters of the site. Two different chaînes opératoires can be identified in TKLF: one based on obtaining flakes from varied blanks, particularly volcanic rocks and the distinctive quartzite, and the second on the manufacture of large and highly standardized bifaces that were produced, used and abandoned in the site.},

It is argued that only one bone-plus-artifact site (FLK Zinj, Olduvai) can be claimed to be almost exclusively anthropogenic during the first million year of archeological record. Through the exceptional preservation of this site, it can further be argued that the carcass acquirement strategies used by hominids did not involve passive scavenging from carnivores but primary access to fleshed carcasses.},

 abstract = {I propose that one of the key factors in human encephalization was increased HUFA intake, especially long-chain, omega-3 fatty acids from aquatic and terrestial meat source. This provided the needed neural membrane fluidity and transmitter/receptor functions for rapid acquisition of more advanced human traits and allowed the expansion of H. erectus into more northern climates. The human brain initially could build ecophenotypically, or adaptive/directed mutationally upon previously evolved mammalian sensor/motor structures, and could rapidly expand cognitive functions within a few million years; as more niches were invaded, more brain diversity was needed to guarantee reproductive success. The metabolically expensive and expanding brain was nutritionally and biochemically set, as it were, for rapid accommodation to tool making, rock throwing, culture language, electronics, and the eventual endless discussion and writings about the brain itself, the evolution of consciousness, and the mid-bran problem [107]. All of this fits, no matter which theory of human evolution one adheres to--i.e., out of Africa, multiregional, etc.--or even the precis fossil chronology [108]. This proposal, based as it is on known facts and certain assumptions appears logical, simple, and satisfying, but it may be wrong. Yet Charles Darwin himself would have approved, because as he so aptly said: false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence do little harm for everyone takes a salutory pleasure in providing their falseness; and when this is done our path toward error is closed and the road to truth is often opened.

Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 24 tule elk temporally dispersed across the late Holocene deposits of the Emeryville Shellmound, California, provide provisional support for a decline in genetic diversity and a population bottleneck beginning about 1600 B.P. Final confirmation of this pattern must await complete replication of the sequences. Stable isotope analyses of the elk bone provide a record of change in the terrestrial environment across the period of deposition and no suggestion that climate change may have played a role in an elk population decline.

Unlike current ecology, paleoecology has to pay more attention when dealing with “real” reconstructions. The concept of uniformitarianism is presented and demonstrates the importance of philosophical constructs in scientific work. Middle-range theory attempts to filter out false conclusions. Abiotic factors have had a strong influence on adaptive evolution; volcanism, tectonics, and climate exemplify this. Subsequently, we address biotic aspects of fossil findings, and in this context we discuss taphonomy, stratigraphic research, and interactions between floral and faunal environment. In a synthesis, we present three cross sections of human evolution at different time horizons (early-middle-late) to exemplify the inevitable multidisciplinarity of paleoecology, and we present some key events that probably altered the direction of radiations among hominids. Obviously, human evolution is not a special kind of evolution; it follows the rules of evolutionary biology, and hence depends undoubtedly on environmental influences.},

 abstract = {This paper is a review of the state of our knowledge and ignorance on Early, Middle, and Late Pleistocene subsistence behavior in Western Europe. There are undoubtedly differences in subsistence behavior between early hominids and Upper Paleolithic humans in Europe. Yet recent research has shown that some of the most extreme statements about passive scavenging practiced on a regular basis at some Middle and Late Pleistocene sites are not supported by the evidence and must be rejected. We provide an overview of the hunting versus scavenging debate in African and European archaeology. We discuss the following issues: (1) evidence for hunting from the earliest sites in Europe, prior to 400–300,000 years ago; (2) evidence for hunting large mammals (elephants, rhinoceroses, large-size bovids) and for hunting/gathering very small vertebrates and invertebrates (leporids, birds, fish, shellfish) before the Upper Paleolithic; (3) evidence for the use of stone-tipped spears by Neanderthals in Western Europe.Our analysis shows: (a) that for the period prior to OIS 12 (i.e. about 400 ka) very few generalizations can be made about the subsistence behavior of early humans in Europe because the informative sites are few and far between. Nevertheless, a good case can be made for hunting from two of the earliest sites inEurope, Gran Dolina TD 6 and Boxgrove; (b) even stronger evidence of hunting comes from sites such as Schöningen and later Middle Paleolithic sites where the topographic setting and the faunal accumulations indicate repeated episodes of hunting the same species of large-size mammals; (c) that Mousterian points were used to tip thrusting or throwing spears already by OIS 6 (i.e. between 186 and 127 ka), before the end of the Middle Pleistocene. Implications for a correlation between hunting weapons and Middle Paleolithic faunal remains are discussed.},

 abstract = {For much of the 20th century, the predominant view of human evolutionary history was derived from the fossil record. Homo erectus was seen arising in Africa from an earlier member of the genus and then spreading throughout the Old World and into the Oceania. A regional continuity model of anagenetic change from H. erectus via various intermediate archaic species into the modern humans in each of the regions inhabited by H. erectus was labeled the multiregional model of human evolution (MRE). A contrasting model positing a single origin, in Africa, of anatomically modern H. sapiens with some populations later migrating out of Africa and replacing the local archaic populations throughout the world with complete replacement became known as the recent African origin (RAO) model. Proponents of both models used different interpretations of the fossil record to bolster their views for decades. In the 1980s, molecular genetic techniques began providing evidence from modern human variation that allowed not only the different models of modern human origins to be tested but also the exploration demographic history and the types of selection that different regions of the genome and even specific traits had undergone. The majority of researchers interpreted these data as strongly supporting the RAO model, especially analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Extrapolating backward from modern patterns of variation and using various calibration points and substitution rates, a consensus arose that saw modern humans evolving from an African population around 200,000 years ago. Much later, around 50,000 years ago, a subset of this population migrated out of Africa replacing Neanderthals in Europe and western Asia as well as archaics in eastern Asia and Oceania. mtDNA sequences from more than two-dozen Neanderthals and early modern humans re-enforced this consensus. In 2010, however, the complete draft genomes of Neanderthals and of heretofore unknown hominins from Siberia, called Denisovans, demonstrated gene flow between these archaic human species and modern Eurasians but not sub-Saharan Africans. Although the levels of gene flow may be very limited, this unexpected finding does not fit well with either the RAO model or MRE model. More thorough sampling of modern human diversity, additional fossil discoveries, and the sequencing of additional hominin fossils are necessary to throw light onto our origins and our history.},

 abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with large allele frequency differences between human populations are relatively rare. The longest run of SNPs with an allele frequency difference of one between the Yoruba of Nigeria and the Han Chinese is found on the long arm of the X chromosome in the intergenic region separating the EDA2R and AR genes. It has been proposed that the unusual allele frequency distributions of these SNPs are the result of a selective sweep affecting African populations that occurred after the out-of-Africa migration. To investigate the evolutionary history of the EDA2R/AR intergenic region, we characterized the haplotype structure of 52 of its highly differentiated SNPs. Using a publicly available data set of 3,000 X chromosomes from 65 human populations, we found that nearly all human X chromosomes carry one of two modal haplotypes for these 52 SNPs. The predominance of two highly divergent haplotypes at this locus was confirmed by use of a subset of individuals sequenced to high coverage. The first of these haplotypes, the α-haplotype is at high frequencies in most of the African populations surveyed and likely arose before the separation of African populations into distinct genetic entities. The second, the β-haplotype, is frequent or fixed in all non-African populations and likely arose in East Africa before the out-of-Africa migration. We also observed a small group or rare haplotypes with no clear relationship to the α- and β-haplotypes. These haplotypes occur at relatively high frequencies in African hunter-gatherer populations, such as the San and Mbuti Pygmies. Our analysis indicates that these haplotypes are part of a pool of diverse, ancestral haplotypes that have now been almost entirely replaced by the α- and β-haplotypes. We suggest that the rise of the α- and β-haplotypes was the result of the demographic forces that human populations experienced during the formation of modern African populations and the out-of-Africa migration. However, we also present evidence that this region is the target of selection in the form of positive selection on the α- and β-haplotypes and of purifying the selection against α/β recombinants. },

 abstract = {Late Quaternary rock-shelter deposits from the Mau Escarpement in Kenya preserve abundant large mammal remains, particularly in Holocene deposits. Taphonomic analysis indicates that people accumulated the Holocene archaeofauna and that, after discard, ravaging carnivores had little impact on the assemblage. The hunters concentrated on small bovids of the forest throughout the occupation, avoiding the larger more dangerous game that must have been abundant. This pattern differs significantly from that documented over the last 100 years for the Okiek hunter-gatherers of the Mau montane forest. Complete carcasses of small bovids were typically transported to the site, and the introduction of pottery had no apparent effect on carcass transport and butchery. Slightly greater bone destruction is evident at the time of the middle Holocene dry phase, and this may relate to more intense grease rendering. Domestic caprines appearedca 4000 years ago, about 900 years after pottery, but small wild bovids dominated the economy until about 3000 years ago when the resident hunter-gatherers became specialized caprine herders.},

 abstract = {This introductory overview presents the frame of research and general goals of the special volume “Archaeological Discontinuities: Comparative Frameworks for the southern hemisphere”. We begin by deconstructing archaeological discontinuities in terms of time and space in order to assess what sort of past phenomena are we dealing with when assessing discontinuities in different scales. It is one of our main contentions that we need theory and data connecting discontinuities as recorded on different analytical scales, thereby contributing to evaluate often-undescribed mechanisms that produce archaeological discontinuities. On this basis, we face the key task of deconstructing archaeological discontinuities from ‘top to bottom’, moving from the averaged material record that is visible in archaeological scale toward the short-term human decisions and interactions that, when occurring cumulatively, produce those discontinuities. Nevertheless, while an understanding of the short-term behavioral mechanisms and social agency behind discontinuities is necessary, it is certainly not sufficient for building a frame in which to make sense of the long-term record.Archaeological discontinuities recorded at different spatial scales require different explanatory mechanisms that can be connected hierarchically. The most productive analytical take here would be to move from the bottom to the top, building from the site or local scales to the regional and continental levels. This strategy provides a solid frame for assessing the genesis of discontinuities at different scales by disentangling the incidence of sampling deficiencies in the field, the selection of samples for chronometric dating, taphonomic biases, the reorganization of mobility and technology, local and regional abandonments, and actual demographic changes.We finish by selecting a few issues that we consider worthy of systematic comparative attention in the years to come. These issues impinge on different levels of theory and methods and can only be pursued with an interdisciplinary focus that encompasses not only archaeology but also ethnography, genetics, linguistics, paleoclimatology and paleoecology. We are convinced that there is much to learn from a comparative perspective in terms of structural similitudes in historical processes across regions and continents. The conceptual structure of a number of debates from South America, Africa, and Australia on is remarkably similar, notwithstanding important differences in terms of chronology and tempo. We look forward to international joint endeavors such as this one that help to formalize questions and data-collecting strategies for the southern drylands and beyond.},

 abstract = {Africa's Middle Stone Age (MSA) may have lasted almost half a million years, but its earliest expression is not yet well understood. The MSA is best known for innovations that appear in the archaeological record at various times after about 200,000 years ago with the first appearance of Homo sapiens. These novel behaviours embrace hafting technology, the use of compound paints and adhesives, ingenious lithic technology that included pressure flaking and the heat treatment of rock, the engraving of ochre and eggshell with geometric designs, the stringing of shell beads and the production of a wide range of bone implements. Such innovations might have been linked to new types of social behaviour stimulated by demographic pulses and movements within and out of the continent. Population shifts may have occurred repeatedly during the MSA. Southern African sites seem concentrated in the interior of the subcontinent before 130 kya. Thus, the florescence of MSA innovations described here appears to have coincided with the dispersal after 130 kya of populations from the interior to mountainous areas, but, more particularly, to the coastal stretches of the southern and western Cape. Coastal sites are the focus of much of southern Africa’s research into the MSA and some of the continent’s most esteemed sites are coastal ones, particularly those containing iconic Still Bay and Howiesons Poort technocomplexes. By 58 kya occupations tended once more to shift away from the southern coast and back into the interior, or to the eastern seaboard. Some of these later MSA sites have extensive footprints, implying population growth or repeated occupations. Regional and even local variability is characteristic of stone assemblages of the time, while sites seem to have fewer ornaments or decorated items than was formerly the case. The variability in late MSA lithic assemblages is matched by apparent flexibility in the timing of the transfer from the MSA to the Later Stone Age.},

 abstract = {The faunal remains from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) layers at Klasies River Mouth (KRM) suggest that South African MSA people hunted and gathered less effectively than their Later Stone Age (LSA) successors. The newly enlarged faunal sample from the MSA layers of Die Kelders Cave 1 (DK1) supports the same basic conclusion. In particular, unlike LSA people living in comparable circumstances, the MSA inhabitants of both DK1 and KRM took many fewer buffaloes than eland, even though buffaloes were probably more common near the sites. The reason for the difference may be that MSA people lacked projectile weapons, and were thus forced to rely on relatively docile species like eland. Eland may have been particularly favored because they are very amenable to driving, and the abundance of prime-age adult individuals at both DK1 and KRM may reflect the relative ease with which eland could be driven over nearby cliffs. Also in contrast to LSA people, the MSA occupants of DK1, and especially KRM, took more subadult and adult seals compared with 9–11 month olds. In this respect, MSA people resembled the brown hyenas who accumulated seal bones in a fossil den at Boegoeberg 1 (BOG1). The relative lack of young seal bones at BOG1 probably reflects the hyenas' coastal presence throughout the year, including times when young seal wash-ups are unusual. By extension, the relative rarity of young seals in MSA (vs.LSA) sites may mean that MSA people failed to focus their coastal visits on the season of peak young seal availability. Together with artefactual and other faunal contrasts between the MSA and LSA, the differences in large bovid and seal exploitation help explain why MSA people did not spread from Africa, even though they were anatomically more modern than their Eurasian contemporaries.},

 abstract = {Across the arid expanses of the Arabian peninsula and even at the margins of its limited upland farmlands in Northern Yemen and the Asir, pastoralism has proved an enduring and effective economic strategy through the later Holocene. Goats, camels, and cattle are the principal herd animals, with mixed strategies of goats and sheep, goats and camels, and to a lesser extent cattle and goats. Strategies have changed through time and across geographic and socio-political territories with the herding of particular animals such as cattle or camels conferring not only specific economic benefits and constraints but also playing significant roles in the establishing and differentiation of people’s social identities and statuses. While it is not entirely clear when a fully pastoral commitment, that is, one that emphasized production of secondary animal products, appeared in Arabia, it is evident that there long remained groups with partial economic dependence on herd animals and still exploiting the rich interior game (e.g., gazelle, ibex) and coastal-estuarine resources (principally fish and shellfish). To the important questions of when and from where domesticated animals entered the Arabian peninsula therefore must be added the question of what constitutes a transition to true pastoralism in the ancient Arabian record. With new evidence from Southern Arabia, it is now possible to address these issues there.},

 abstract = {Abstract Early Stone Age cut marks created during tool‐assisted carnivory potentially offer inferences into hominin butchery behaviour and access to complete or defleshed carcasses. Actualistic butchery trials of 16 goat and cow half‐carcasses were completed by an experienced butcher with replicated Oldowan tools to investigate how the geometric organisation of cut mark clusters reflects flake versus core tool use and bulk muscle versus scrap defleshing. A cluster of cut marks is defined as a series of adjacent cut mark striations that occur at an anatomical location and are bounded by unmarked cortical surface. Tool type and butchery action were predicted to differentially mark certain long bone portions and influence cluster attributes. Moulds of 613 cut mark clusters were photographed and measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for cluster area, cut mark count, median cut mark length and standard deviation of cut mark length and angle. Analysis suggests the following results: (i) cluster attributes are correlated;(ii) changes in cluster geometry are related to increasing cut mark count and length but not tool type or defleshed muscle amount; (iii) large clusters occur on large animals; and (iv) long bone midshaft portions are cut‐marked during both bulk and scrap muscle defleshing. Analysis of 179 cut mark clusters on long bone shafts of sizes 1–4 mammals from three Okote member assemblages at Koobi Fora, Kenya, shows that archaeological clusters have a similar number of marks when compared with experimental clusters but are significantly smaller, have shorter median marks and include less deviation in mark length and angle. Archaeological clusters corroborate that increasing area is positively correlated with cut mark count, median mark length and standard deviation of mark length and angle. A quantitative inferential model that links cut mark cluster geometry to tool type or the amount of muscle defleshed is not supported by these data. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Looking at hunting beyond pure subsistence choices, this paper couples traditional morphological analysis with taphonomic analysis and theoretical frameworks of intensification to ask new socially focussed zooarchaeological questions of these assemblages. Through this, both the procurement and processing methods utilized at Le6 and Le7 are identified and the significance of these choices is discussed. In so doing, the paper addresses possible specialization in both the hunting and the processing of large wild mammals.

Our results indicate that levels of destruction are equivalent regardless of the numbers of hyenas or long-bones included in the experimental assemblages. Correlations between long-bone epiphyseal and near-epiphyseal portions and bone density, however, do provide an indication of the level of competition.

 abstract = { New data from Europe, putting back the appearance of tools showing affinities or belonging to the Acheulean technocomplex to the late Early Pleistocene, open new questions about the onset of handaxe-making behaviour in the North Mediterranean region. This research aims to provide some clues to the debate by analysing at regional and local scale the main characteristics of the large mammalian fauna before and around the time of the first appearance of Large Cutting Tools in SW Europe. The database consists of 110 large mammal taxa from 58 local faunal assemblages (LFAs), ranging in age from about 1.6 to 0.5 Ma. Results obtained indicate that at the time of the Mid–Pleistocene Revolution the dynamics of large mammal fauna was mainly regulated by discrete dispersal events triggered by major climate changes. The environmental changes, removing keystone species and merging previously independently evolved taxa into new palaeo-communities, altered their internal equilibrium, giving rise to new inter-guild and intra-guild dynamics. The Lower local Stratigraphical Occurrence (LlSO) of various large mammals in key European Early and early Middle Pleistocene sites indicates that the change in taxonomical composition and structure of the fauna was a gradual process, caused by neither “turnover pulse” nor “migratory wave” events. Nonetheless, the evidence of multiple, discrete dispersals of large mammals may support the hypothesis that a few, poorly recorded dispersal events involving small human groups carrying a new technology led culturally different populations to coexist for a while in Europe during the late Early Pleistocene. The similarity degree among the ecological structure of LFAs, bearing or not evidence of human presence, shows on one hand that LFAs sharing a similar functional diversity were sparsely distributed over time, sometimes irrespectively of the age of sites and poorly affected by their geographic position. On the other, results obtained suggest that the relative amount of ecological groups related to the habitat preference and trophic behaviour of species, and the prey/predator relationships were among the factors that mainly controlled the human presence/absence at any site. Conversely, the presence of large predators does not seem to have had any particular relevance in controlling human dispersal and settlement. Based on available data, the hypothesis that the appearance of large cutting tools in Spain may more likely represent either the result of a local technological evolution or a different activity facies than a technological behaviour brought by newcomer populations seems to be the most parsimonious.},

 abstract = {Batadomba-lena, a rockshelter in the rainforest of southwestern Sri Lanka, has yielded some of the earliest evidence of Homo sapiens in South Asia. H. sapiens foragers were present at Batadomba-lena from ca. 36,000 cal BP to the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Human occupation was sporadic before the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Batadomba-lena's Late Pleistocene inhabitants foraged for a broad spectrum of plant and mainly arboreal animal resources (monkeys, squirrels and abundant rainforest snails), derived from a landscape that retained equatorial rainforest cover through periods of pronounced regional aridity during the LGM. Juxtaposed hearths, palaeofloors with habitation debris, postholes, excavated pits, and animal and plant remains, including abundant Canarium nutshells, reflect intensive habitation of the rockshelter in times of monsoon intensification and biome reorganisation after ca. 16,000 cal BP. This period corresponds with further broadening of the economic spectrum, evidenced though increased contribution of squirrels, freshwater snails and Canarium nuts in the diet of the rockshelter occupants. Microliths are more abundant and morphologically diverse in the earliest, pre-LGM layer and decline markedly during intensified rockshelter use on the wane of the LGM. We propose that changing toolkits and subsistence base reflect changing foraging practices, from shorter-lived visits of highly mobile foraging bands in the period before the LGM, to intensified use of Batadomba-lena and intense foraging for diverse resources around the site during and, especially, following the LGM. Traces of ochre, marine shell beads and other objects from an 80 km-distant shore, and, possibly burials reflect symbolic practices from the outset of human presence at the rockshelter. Evidence for differentiated use of space (individual hearths, possible habitation structures) is present in LGM and terminal Pleistocene layers. The record of Batadomba-lena demonstrates that Late Pleistocene pathways to (aspects of) behavioural 'modernity' (composite tools, practice of symbolism and ritual, broad spectrum economy) were diverse and ecologically contingent.},

Cette diversité se trouve néanmoins menacée depuis peu par des changements drastiques dans nos habitudes de vie comme la prise en charge des naissances, l’environnement extérieur, l’alimentation et les pratiques médicales. Les deux dernières générations ont été le cadre de modifications importantes des modes de vies et d’alimentation, avec une augmentation de la sédentarité, une suralimentation et une exposition importante aux médicaments et aux polluants. Nous sommes maintenant en mesure d’évaluer l’impact de ces changements sur la diversité du microbiote intestinal. Parallèlement à ces modifications du mode de vie, on a pu observer une explosion de l’incidence de maladies liées à un dysfonctionnement du système immunitaire comme les maladies métaboliques, les allergies et les maladies inflammatoires et plus étonnamment des maladies neurodégénératives et des désordres psychiatriques. Le microbiote est devenu un sujet d’actualité dans la communauté scientifique ainsi que dans les medias grand public. Le nombre de publications scientifiques a augmenté d’un facteur trois sur les cinq dernières années, les domaines des maladies gastro-intestinales et liées aux dysfonctionnements métaboliques étant les plus étudiés. D’un point de vue de la propriété intellectuelle, les familles de brevets traitant du microbiote ont plus que doublé sur la même période. En parallèle, les financements provenant soit des organisations étatiques (par exemple du National Institute of Health [NIH] qui finance les recherches essentiellement dans le domaine des allergies, des anti-infectieux, du cancer et des maladies cardio-vasculaires, ou de la Maison Blanche qui a lancé l’initiative nationale sur le microbiome) soit des entreprises pharmaceutiques ont suivi la même tendance et reflètent une poussée des investissements et un soutien important de ce domaine de la recherche sur le microbiote. Tous les acteurs majeurs de la santé investissent actuellement dans la recherche sur le microbiome ce qui se traduit par le grand nombre de contrats et de financements signés en 2015. La table ronde des Ateliers de Giens s’est intéressée à envisager comment la médecine de demain, en considérant l’homme comme un supra-organisme symbiotique homme–microbes, pourra bénéficier du savoir acquis sur les fonctions du microbiote et sur le microbiome en tant qu’outil thérapeutique. La réflexion de notre groupe de travail a été structurée autour de quatre domaines d’innovation qui pourraient bénéficier des efforts réalisés actuellement afin de déchiffrer les interactions entre cellules humaines et le microbiome intestinal, en tant qu’élément central de la santé humaine, c’est-à-dire : 1) le développement d’outils de stratification et de monitorage ; 2) l’identification de cibles originales et de nouvelles drogues à partir du microbiome en tant que partie de notre supra-génome ; 3) l’exploitation du microbiote en tant que cible thérapeutique qui peut être modulable ; et enfin, 4) comme source de biothérapeutiques vivants ou d’adjuvants. Ces quatre chapitres vont permettre de montrer comment le microbiote a modifié notre façon de considérer un grand nombre de maladies chroniques et incurables comme les conséquences d’une dysbiose établie et durable. L’analyse en profondeur du microbiote est le point de départ d’un des plus vastes chantiers de recherches qui permettra l’amélioration de la santé humaine et animale et qui deviendra la source d’innovations médicales pour couvrir les gaps thérapeutiques d’aujourd’hui. Nous proposons donc une série de recommandations que nous adressons aux chercheurs académiques, aux cliniciens ainsi qu’aux autorités de santé, afin que les analyses du microbiote gagnent en fiabilité et solidité. Ceci permettra d’accélérer le processus de découvertes et ainsi que leurs applications afin que tous puissent en bénéficier.},

 abstract = {Paternal care is less common than maternal care because male fitness usually depends on the number of mating opportunities with distinct females. Yet, males also invest in parental care when offspring survival depends on paternal contribution for protection and/or brood nutrition and mating opportunities with new females are scarce. Although the second condition is common in spiders, male contribution to the survival of spiderlings is very rare. However, males of Manogea porracea build their webs above female webs, where they capture prey throughout the reproductive period. In addition, both sexes may have contact with eggsacs and attack predators that approach them. This unusual extended period of co-occurrence between males and their offspring may favour the establishment of paternal care. Here, we investigated (1) the mortality factors influencing offspring survival, (2) how the presence of parents affects offspring survival, (3) how males affect web integrity and protect eggs against predation and (4) variations in operational sex ratio (OSR) during the reproductive season, along with the proportion of eggsacs in webs occupied by males alone before the dispersal of spiderlings. We found that (1) four kleptoparasitic/araneophagic spider species invaded webs and attacked eggsacs, (2) parental care significantly improved offspring survival, (3) males maintained web integrity and protected offspring against the attacks of two araneophagic species and (4) the OSR became quickly biased towards males, and that these remaining males assumed exclusive care of 68% of the eggsacs produced during the season. The ability of males to protect the offspring and the reduced availability of receptive females at the end of the reproductive season might represent the possible causes of male care in M. porracea. We propose that web building by males and their rapid access to the eggsacs create unique conditions that may favour the evolution of paternal care in Cyrtophorinae.},

 abstract = {Our understanding of modern human origins has recently been changed by the reconstruction of draft genomes from several Neandertals and an archaic human specimen from Denisova Cave, Russia. These genomes demonstrated that living people outside Africa have inherited roughly 3% of their genomes from Neandertals, and that additionally people in Australia and New Guinea have up to 5% Denisovan ancestry. This pattern of ancestry constrains hypotheses about the process of modern human emergence. A single massive bottleneck cannot be consistent with these data, and instead a longer, more complex process of population interactions must have taken place. The emergence of humans within Africa took place in a large metapopulation that had already undergone regional differentiation before the Late Pleistocene. Very few amino acid substitutions are fixed in humans relative to Neandertals or Denisovans. The shared phenotypes of living people probably involve convergent or parallel changes in many allele frequencies rather than the substitution of a few adaptive alleles that became fixed. We can observe that much of the variation of archaic humans still survives in the human population today.},

 abstract = {Mumba Rockshelter in northern Tanzania presents one of the richest and most complete archaeological sequences in East Africa for the Middle Stone Age through the Iron Age. Past excavations of the shelter revealed an extremely rich lithic and faunal assemblage, but were problematic, either because of poor excavation and recording methods (in the 1930s), or because the materials were never fully studied (in the 1979/1981 excavations). In both cases, excavators had concluded that the shelter contained a deposit without visible separation between archaeological levels. Re-excavation of Mumba, using modern techniques for recording spatial data, show that the previous geological and archaeological sub-divisions of the shelter deposits need much revision. The results of the excavation have implications for the interpretation of the “transitional” Mumba Industry in the Pleistocene levels and for the co-occurrence of ceramic traditions in the Holocene levels.},

 abstract = {New evidence for the tissue types exploited by early hominids from carcasses possibly acquired through scavenging is derived from the larger mammal bone assemblages from FLK I, level 22 (Zinjanthropus floor), and FLKN levels 1 and 2 from Bed I, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Published skeletal part profiles from the two archaeological sites are evaluated using (i) modern observations on the sequence by which carnivores consume carcass parts in order to assess the timing of hominid access to carcasses, and (ii) measurements of flesh and marrow yields to assess the tissue types sought and acquired. These results suggest that the maximization of marrow (fat) yields, not flesh (protein) yields, was the criterion shaping decisions about carcass processing. Because of evidence for density-dependent destruction of some flesh-bearing parts by scavengers of the hominid-butchered assemblages, however, it is uncertain whether carcass parts were transported and acquired by hominids in a largely defleshed condition. The results on tissue types acquired are combined with a discussion of predation risk, feeding competition and the equipment needs of carcass processing in an attempt to identify archaeological test implications of competing hypotheses for the socio-economic function of the earliest archaeological sites.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Honey is a highly nutritious resource for any primate able to exploit it. Wild chimpanzees exploit nests of honey-making bees (Apini and Meliponini) for honey and brood, typically using tools to overcome the bees' defences. The universality of honey-gathering among modern human foragers in tropical climates and chimpanzees suggests energy-rich honey, acquired with tools, was likely a regular food for ancestral hominins. However, few studies have assessed its role in seasonal foraging strategies of chimpanzees. This study asks whether honey serves as a high-quality fallback food for chimpanzees at Bulindi, Uganda.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Honey consumption was investigated via fecal analysis over 22 months during two studies (Study 1: 2007-2008; Study 2: 2012-2014). Additionally, flower and fruit phenology was measured during Study 1; peak flowering intensity was expected to facilitate increased honey and/or brood production by bees.
RESULTS: Chimpanzees consumed honey (and/or brood) at low frequencies year-round, but bees/beeswax appeared in feces at higher frequencies with decreasing fruit availability (Study 1). Honey consumption was unrelated to flowering and chimpanzees did not consume honey more frequently during the "honey season" when local people harvest beehives. Moreover, consumption was inversely related to fruit intake (both study periods).
DISCUSSION: Although honey fits the functional definition of a filler fallback food at Bulindi, the chimpanzees unlikely depend on honey to replace nutrients provided by fruit. Overall, honey best qualifies as an energy-dense "treat" during low fruiting months. The data lend support to the hypothesis that tools can facilitate chimpanzees' access to high-quality fallbacks including insect foods when fruit availability is low.},

 abstract = {The ability of archaic Homo sapiens to survive in more northerly latitudes was contingent on securing a regular source of animal fat and protein. We present a taphonomic study that examines how successful these hominins were at acquiring these food sources during the latter part of the Early Paleolithic in Northeast Asia. This study focuses on the long bone midshaft surface modifications observed on the faunal remains from Xujiayao, a middle-late Pleistocene open-air site located at 40 degrees latitude in the western Nihewan Basin, northern China. The faunal assemblage is dominated by equid remains. Analysis of the percussion, tooth, and cut mark frequencies on the long bone midshafts demonstrates that the Xujiayao hominins had primary access to high utility (meat-bearing and marrow-rich) long bones. Investigation of the dual-patterned (tooth-marked and butchery-marked) bone fragments suggests that hominins were under little pressure from competing carnivores to abandon their kills. The lack of significant differences between the size of fragments with only percussion-marks and those with only tooth-marks supports these findings. Fragmentation ratios indicate that forelimbs were more intensively processed than hind limbs. Based on the water rounding and abrasion data, the Xujiayao assemblage is likely of autochthonous origin. Since the age of Xujiayao is still in question, we can only conclude that archaic Homo sapiens were successful predators of large game in Northeast Asia some time during the latter part of the Early Paleolithic.},

 abstract = {The application of modern methodological taphonomic approaches to Pleistocene faunal assemblages that were excavated and interpreted before taphonomic analyses became common are critical to verifying whether the original interpretations are valid. Even though taphonomic research is common in North America, Africa, and Europe, few such studies of faunal collections have been carried out in East Asia. In this regard, taphonomic analysis of the faunal assemblage from Hanaizumi, Japan serves as an excellent case study because few taphonomic re-analyses of previously excavated Pleistocene assemblages have been performed in Japan. Hanaizumi was excavated in the 1950s and the original behavioral interpretation was that hunter-gatherers were responsible for the accumulation of the faunal assemblage, which is dominated by bison (Bison priscus). The taphonomic analysis presented here indicates that evidence of human modification is present on the bones. However, results suggest that even though hunter-gatherers may have had primary access to many of the bison in the assemblage, Hanaizumi was probably not a kill site or a hunter-gatherer home base as was originally proposed. Rather, the acquisition of bison may have taken place further up river and Hanaizumi is the locality to which the already processed carcasses were transported via fluvial movement. Accordingly, it is difficult to use the Hanaizumi faunal dataset to address current paleoanthropological debates. Future fieldwork at the site may indicate that hunter-gatherers played a more significant role in the formation of the bison bone assemblage. For now, Hanaizumi is best considered an allochthonous paleontological collection that has assisted in paleoenvironmental reconstructions of Late Pleistocene Japan.},

 abstract = {Sharing important resources widely beyond direct kin group members is one of the core features characterizing human societies. Moreover, generalized exchange involving many community members (e.g., meat sharing in bands) seems to be a uniquely human practice. This paper explores a computational algorithm for the psychology of social sharing that may underlie such practices, based on the risk-reduction hypothesis in food sharing of Kaplan and Hill [Curr. Anthropol. 26 (1985) 223]. We predicted that, independent of the amount of effort actually invested, uncertainty involved in resource acquisition is a key factor that triggers the psychology of social sharing for both acquirers and nonacquirers of a resource. It was also predicted that the “windfall effect” is independent of individual preferences as to modern distributive ideologies. Four multisample/multimethod studies, using Japanese and American participants, and laboratory as well as vignette experiments, supported these predictions: although the identical fungible resource (money) was under consideration, different psychological processes were triggered, depending on the degree of uncertainty involved in the money acquisition. Implications of the windfall effect for egalitarianism in resource sharing, observed not only in hunter–gatherer bands but also in highly industrialized societies, are discussed.},

The model presented suggests that group foraging tactics, in combination with high mobility, are central to successful confrontational scavenging (interference competition), whereas individual foraging tactics and high mobility are central to successful nonconfrontational scavenging (exploitative competition). In contrast, group or individual foraging tactics and low mobility characterize the acquisition of fresh carcasses in low-competition contexts. Individual foraging tactics and low mobility are employed in response to extreme competition over marginal resources. Preliminary tests with data from Bed I Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora suggest that Plio-Pleistocene hominids, like other large-bodied predators, employed flexible foraging tactics involving changes in group size and levels of mobility to gain access to carcasses in both low-and high-competition contexts.},

 abstract = {The Abric Romaní site is located in the northeast Iberian Peninsula, 50 km from Barcelona 317 m above sea level, in a travertine cliff on the right bank of the Anoia river, which is a tributary of the Llobregat river. This river passes by the Capellades locality, forming a narrow gorge known as “Cinglera del Capelló”. This corridor crosses the mountain range “Cordillera Prelitoral”, and is considered as a natural passage between the inland and coastal Catalonia regions. This situation provides the possibility to exploit a great variety of biotopes. The site yielded an important and complete stratigraphic sequence of European Middle Paleolithic. Fifteen archeological levels have been excavated until today, which appear as thin layers between sterile travertine platforms. This sequence has been dated by U-series between 70 and 40 ka BP, except for the uppermost level, which is attributed to the Early Upper Paleolithic. Pollen analyses have revealed five climatic phases, ranging from the milder conditions at the bottom to an interstadial climate at the top, correlated with the Hengelo interstadial. It is, consequently, a key site for human behavioral studies among Neanderthal groups. This paper presents the results of studies on resource procurements, lithics and animals and on the territory used by Neanderthal groups, through the example of level M dated around 55 ka BP. The results of the lithic analysis and faunal assemblages suggest that the resource procurement and management is focused on a local and semi-local exploitation in a geographic area of about 20 km around the rock-shelter.},

 abstract = {While it is well established that the Mbuti pygmies, hunter-gatherers of the Ituri Forest of Zaire, trade forest products and labor for agricultural foods, it has been assumed that this is a recent development, following contact with shifting cultivators. From field investigations over a five-year period, Hart and Hart found that, while the Mbuti can identify a large number of edible plant species, they actually gather very few of them. Instead, they trade meat, which is seasonally abundant, as well as their own labor for agricultural products rich in starch and carbohydrates. While game is available throughout the year, they cannot profitably utilize protein as a main caloric intake; lean meat requires more calories to digest than it supplies, a point illustrated by what the explorer Henry Stanley called in 1890 the “starvation camps” in the middle of the Ituri: People were dying while surrounded by game. Hart and Hart found that almost all of the oil-rich plant foods collected came from secondary forests rather than from that part of the Ituri hitherto unpenetrated by cultivators. Using historical data from early travellers, archaeological evidence, and linguistic connections linking various Mbuti groups to different cultivators, Hart and Hart make the case that the great evergreen primary forests of the Ituri were probably not capable of sustaining hunter-gatherers in significant numbers prior to the coming of cultivators, about 4000 years ago. This a good illustration of complex and interdependent ties that link what might appear to be distinct adaptations. Here agriculture has made the forest a more hospitable environment for specialized hunter-gatherers by providing a reliable source of energy-rich foods as well as by producing patches of secondary forest in which to forage.},

 abstract = {At the Mesolithic-Neolithic sites (9500–5500calBCE) of Lepenski Vir and Vlasac in the Danube Gorges of Serbia, numerous disarticulated human remains were unearthed along with articulated skeletons. In many cases primary burial was only a temporary stage in the funerary ritual and skeletonised bodies were exhumed, manipulated, and re-located. The majority of bodies were left to decay within the ground prior to exhumation and disarticulation. In some instances, however, the presence of cut-marks indicates that human intervention occurred before completion of the natural decay process. In this paper we present frequency, distribution and micro-morphometric analyses of cut-marks on disarticulated human bones from Lepenski Vir and Vlasac. The use of a Focus Variation Microscope (the Alicona ‘InfiniteFocus’) has enabled 3-dimensional quantitative analyses of cut-mark characteristics. The location and infrequency of cut-marks strongly suggest that active defleshing was not a systematic part of funerary ritual at these sites, but it more likely occurred on bodies that were accidentally unearthed prior to skeletonisation. Based on the micro-morphometric analysis, discernible and measurable differences exist between different cutting practices and we now better understand the ways in which human bodies were treated. Taking into account other taphonomic observations, we suggest that cutting occurred on partially decomposed bodies.},

 abstract = {Understanding the behavioral adaptations and subsistence strategies of Middle Paleolithic humans is critical in the debate over the evolution and manifestations of modern human behavior. The study of faunal remains plays a central role in this context. Until now, the majority of Levantine archaeofaunal evidence was derived from late Middle Paleolithic sites. The discovery of faunal remains from Misliya Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel (>200 ka), allowed for detailed taphonomic and zooarchaeological analyses of these early Middle Paleolithic remains. The Misliya Cave faunal assemblage is overwhelmingly dominated by ungulate taxa. The most common prey species is the Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica), followed closely by the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella). Some aurochs (Bos primigenius) remains are also present. Small-game species are rare. The fallow deer mortality pattern is dominated by prime-aged individuals. A multivariate taphonomic analysis demonstrates (1) that the assemblage was created solely by humans occupying the cave and was primarily modified by their food-processing activities; and (2) that gazelle carcasses were transported complete to the site, while fallow deer carcasses underwent some field butchery. The new zooarchaeological data from Misliya Cave, particularly the abundance of meat-bearing limb bones displaying filleting cut marks and the acquisition of prime-age prey, demonstrate that early Middle Paleolithic people possessed developed hunting capabilities. Thus, modern large-game hunting, carcass transport, and meat-processing behaviors were already established in the Levant in the early Middle Paleolithic, more than 200 ka ago.},

 abstract = {Zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses provide an essential backdrop to discussions of Late Middle Palaeolithic and Early Upper Palaeolithic patterns of mobility, land-use, and hunting, and the degree and manner(s) of Neanderthal and modern human competition within the southern Caucasus. Recent research at Ortvale Klde has documented the hunting of prime-age adult Capra caucasica and the organization of hunting activities according to this species' migratory behaviors, which made them locally abundant on a seasonal basis. Our analyses suggest that Neanderthals and modern humans occupied the same ecological niche and were equally capable of learning and exploiting key biogeographic information pertaining to the feeding, mating, migratory, and flight behaviors of this species. In these respects there appear to have been few alterations in medium/large game hunting practices between the Late Middle Palaeolithic and Early Upper Palaeolithic, with ungulate species abundance in the entire stratigraphic sequence of Ortvale Klde reflecting seasonal fluctuations in food supply rather than specialization, differences in diet breadth, hunting ability, or technology. Attention is paid to faunal data from neighboring sites to test whether patterns identified at Ortvale Klde are in any way representative of larger regional subsistence behaviors. We find that such patterns are only replicable at sites that have experienced similar zooarchaeological and taphonomic study. We conclude that Neanderthal and modern human populations occupied and exploited the same ecological niches, at least seasonally, and that the regional archaeological record documents a clear spatial and temporal disruption in Neanderthal settlement resulting from failed competition with expanding modern human groups. In terms of niche and resource preference, we suggest that Neanderthals and modern humans were sympatric to the point of exclusion.},

In these cases, frequent movement and wide‐ranging foraging, associated with evidence for scavenging of large game, appears to be linked to the production and extensive resharpening of relatively large tool blanks and possibly to greater evidence for artifact transport. More intensive and prolonged occupations, marked by the introduction of entire carcasses of hunted animals into cave sites, are associated with less intensive reduction of tools and greater reliance on immediately available raw materials.},

 abstract = {Disease susceptibility can arise as a consequence of adaptation to infectious disease. Recent findings have suggested that higher rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals with recent African ancestry might be attributed to two risk alleles (G1 and G2) at the serum-resistance-associated (SRA)-interacting-domain-encoding region of APOL1. These two alleles appear to have arisen adaptively, possibly as a result of their protective effects against human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or African sleeping sickness. In order to explore the distribution of potential functional variation at APOL1, we studied nucleotide variation in 187 individuals across ten geographically and genetically diverse African ethnic groups with exposure to two Trypanosoma brucei subspecies that cause HAT. We observed unusually high levels of nonsynonymous polymorphism in the regions encoding the functional domains that are required for lysing parasites. Whereas allele frequencies of G2 were similar across all populations (3%-8%), the G1 allele was only common in the Yoruba (39%). Additionally, we identified a haplotype (termed G3) that contains a nonsynonymous change at the membrane-addressing-domain-encoding region of APOL1 and is present in all populations except for the Yoruba. Analyses of long-range patterns of linkage disequilibrium indicate evidence of recent selection acting on the G3 haplotype in Fulani from Cameroon. Our results indicate that the G1 and G2 variants in APOL1 are geographically restricted and that there might be other functional variants that could play a role in HAT resistance and CKD risk in African populations. },

 abstract = {Meat scavenged by early Homo could have contributed importantly to a higher-quality diet. However, it has been suggested that because carrion would normally have been contaminated by bacteria it would have been dangerous and therefore eaten rarely prior to the advent of cooking. In this study, we quantified bacterial loads on two tissues apparently eaten by hominins, meat and bone marrow. We tested the following three hypotheses: (1) the bacterial loads on exposed surfaces of raw meat increase within 24 h to potentially dangerous levels, (2) simple roasting of meat on hot coals kills most bacteria, and (3) fewer bacteria grow on marrow than on meat, making marrow a relatively safe food. Our results supported all three hypotheses. Our experimental data imply that early hominins would have found it difficult to scavenge safely without focusing on marrow, employing strategies of carrion selection to minimize pathogen load, or cooking.},

 abstract = {Malaria has been a very strong selection pressure in recent human evolution, particularly in Africa. Of the one million deaths per year due to malaria, more than 90% are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with high levels of genetic variation and population substructure. However, there have been few studies of nucleotide variation at genetic loci that are relevant to malaria susceptibility across geographically and genetically diverse ethnic groups in Africa. Invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum parasites is central to the pathology of malaria. Glycophorin A (GYPA) and B (GYPB), which determine MN and Ss blood types, are two major receptors that are expressed on erythrocyte surfaces and interact with parasite ligands. We analyzed nucleotide diversity of the glycophorin gene family in 15 African populations with different levels of malaria exposure. High levels of nucleotide diversity and gene conversion were found at these genes. We observed divergent patterns of genetic variation between these duplicated genes and between different extracellular domains of GYPA. Specifically, we identified fixed adaptive changes at exons 3-4 of GYPA. By contrast, we observed an allele frequency spectrum skewed toward a significant excess of intermediate-frequency alleles at GYPA exon 2 in many populations; the degree of spectrum distortion is correlated with malaria exposure, possibly because of the joint effects of gene conversion and balancing selection. We also identified a haplotype causing three amino acid changes in the extracellular domain of glycophorin B. This haplotype might have evolved adaptively in five populations with high exposure to malaria.},

We present experimentally derived data on the bone marrow content of seven fresh gazelle carcasses, determine the range of marrow yields among individuals of different sexes and seasons of death, and compare the new data to gazelle skeletal element abundances from five Epipalaeolithic assemblages from Israel. We found extensive variation in marrow fat content among individual gazelles. Animals with the highest marrow yields were killed in the spring while animals killed in the early autumn had lower fat contents. Nevertheless, our results suggest that gazelle marrow provided a reliable, albeit small fat resource for prehistoric foragers in all seasons. Strong relationships between bone fragmentation and marrow content demonstrate that Epipalaeolithic people preferentially processed bones with high marrow yields.},

Here we report on experimental work with wood- and stone-tipped arrows fired into calibrated ballistic gel. While the stone-tipped arrows underperformed with respect to penetration, they far exceeded the wood-tipped arrows in the volume of gelatin destroyed. These results suggest that the total volume of tissue destroyed by a projectile is as or more important than its penetration depth, that adding a lithic point increases the lethality of a projectile, and that decisions about projectile armatures were motivated by economic rather than social concerns.},

Skeletons of all samples were quickly and substantially destroyed, with roasted animals surviving at one‐half to one‐third the rate of their boiled counterparts. Survivorship of elements was unrelated to skeletal density in either case, but rather to the amount of adhering tissue, marrow, and fat. Axial elements tended to be preferentially destroyed, particularly in the case of roasting. These effects echo ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological observations on the relationship between cooking, length of site occupation, and small animal survivorship and carry clear implications for how we use the relative frequencies of large and small animals to interpret prehistoric subsistence.

 abstract = {The study of human nature has fueled scientific debate since antiquity, and much research today still tries to reconcile how we can be both selfish and prosocial. In this chapter we argue that, throughout evolution, multilevel selection shaped our brain to fulfill two core psychological motives, self-enhancement and group inclusion, which independently drive hic et nunc behavior. Evolutionary old motivational brain systems are complemented by heuristic processes that rely on more recently evolved brain systems to allow us to flexibly switch between various decision-options depending on environmental conditions and learned experiences. We present evidence that two heuristics emerged to solve social dilemma problems in which there is a conflict of motives forcing people to choose between a self-serving and a collectively beneficial option. These two heuristics (or rules of thumbs), “I am selfish, unless there are incentives that align self-and collective interest,” and “I am cooperative, unless my partner is untrustworthy,” facilitate two alternative routes to cooperation, the former based on incentives, the latter based on trust. By matching relevant features of the environment (the presence of incentives and trust signals) to decision making, these heuristic processes are ecologically rational and furthermore lend themselves well to being studied using the tools of neuroeconomics.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the assertion that a genetically programmed instinct referred to as the agrarian imperative underlies a territorial drive that compels farmers and their biological heirs to hang on to their land at all costs while working hard, taking risks, enduring pain, and hardship. Research from multiple fields refutes the assumption. Basic physiologic instincts are not primary drivers of animal or human behavior. Their expression is greatly modified by the physical and social environments in which animals mature and learn. The human cerebral cortex with forethought and reflection greatly modifies basic instinctual drives. As a result, human behavior is to a large degree self-reflective and self-determined within the limits of the opportunities and resources available to individuals. The primary factors involved in continued successful farm operations across generations are not genetic, but rather farmers' access to economic, cultural, and social capital resources. These forms of capital and their distribution explain the evolution of human societies from preagricultural hunter-gather tribes to agrarian family kinship groups to complex nation states. Current highly mechanized, large-scale agricultural production focused on a few genetic strains of plants and animals provides abundant food at low cost, but is vulnerable to man-made and natural pandemics of human, animal, and plant pathogens as well as to disasters that can destroy the infrastructure required to support the system. A critical agrarian imperative is to ensure in perpetuity a pool of small farm operators capable of using simple farming technology for raising multiple cultivars and species of plants and animals.},

 abstract = {The estimation of human population size during the Pleistocene is complex, and one which has been dealt with extensively in the literature. However, because many of these previous estimations are based in part on archaeological site distributions, they are more a reflection of present-day geography than of what the Earth looked like in the past. We address this issue by calculating an estimation of habitable land area during the Last Glacial Maximum (between 22 and 19 kya) when sea level was 120 m lower than today using the polygon creation function in Google Earth. We then subtract areas of land that were likely uninhabitable during the LGM – either due to glacier cover, extreme aridity, elevation, or areas at high latitudes. From this, the combined habitable land areas of Eurasia, Africa and the Australian landmass are estimated as 76,959,712.4 km2. This estimation is then coupled with population density data for medium-to large-bodied carnivores, and ethnographic population density data for hunter–gatherers culled from the literature. Total human census population size in the Old World during the Last Glacial Maximum is estimated at 2,117,000–2,955,000 based on carnivore densities and 3,046,000–8,307,000 for hunter–gatherer densities.},

The subjects were sampled from 18 rural ethnic groups which largely differ in their biotope, mode of subsistance and morphology. Each of the three variables: systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR varies significantly between the ethnic groups. The first two are closely intercorrelated, whereas mean HR varies independently of mean SBP. Mean HR varies independently of morphology (as represented by 5 anthropometric variables), whereas SBP is significantly correlated with calf circumference between populations, but not within populations. Mean HR varies independently of climate, whereas mean SBP is significantly and negatively correlated with annual rainfall. The general mean of SBP is low by French standards. The SDs are such that it looks unlikely that SBP increases much with age in any of the 18 populations. All significant results concerning SBP can be explained by interpopulational variation in food intake. However, this variation explains only a part of that of mean SBP. A comparison of the conditions of life of those African populations in which SBP increases with age in adults and those in which it does not suggests that this process is a maladaptive response to a disturbed psychosocial environment.},

The advantages of using permanent seed stores as the source of seed grain is much more difficult to perceive and it is upon this accident that full-scale agriculture waited. Jacobs' (1969) model of cities before agriculture is the explanation of permanent seed bins for purely economic reasons. It is the role of bin permanence in switching the selective mechanism towards cultivars that explains the precipitous events c. 8000 B.C. Once cultivars are developed, true large-scale agriculture becomes an obvious advantage but not until the cultivars are there. Jacobs' model seeks to put hunters and traders into a positive loop that alone produces the city. This could not be so for there is not enough food at appropriate points in the model; but if casual sowing can be invoked as a long-standing precursor, then the extra forcing function allows the vital transition to genetic continuity in the harvested grain.},

Instead, people’s behaviour is consistent with choices based on social preferences in which people place a positive value on fairness, reciprocity, or equity (see Camerer, 2003, for a review). For example, subjects typically make significant positive contributions in the public goods games, reject positive offers in the ultimatum game, and impose costly punishment in the third-party punishment game (see, Camerer, ch. 2, for descriptions of these games.) In some games these results are insensitive to framing and whether behaviour is anonymous to the experimenter (‘double blind’).},

Ce crâne étroitement associé à des artefacts en pierre et en bois fait partie intégrante de la composition du sol d'occupation acheuléen. Son emplacement et les dommages qu'il a subis suggèrent des fractures intentionnelles pour l'extraction de la cervelle. Un nucleus en basalte, un bloc de pierre et un morceau de chêne se trouvaient sous le crâne et ont pu être utilisés pour le retourner. On décrit ici un scénario possible de chasse et de démembrement, en s' inspirant de parallèles archéologiques et modernes. Ces trouvailles corroborent d'autres éléments mis en évidence sur le site qui indiquent un comportement sophistiqué des habitants de cette région, il y a 500.000 ans.
A skull of a straight-tusked elephant, Palaeoloxodon antiquus, was discovered in 1989 at the Middle Pleistocene site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel. The skull is closely associated with stone and wood artifacts, and is an integral component of an Acheulian living-floor. The specimen was positioned and damaged in such a way as to suggest deliberale breakage for brain extraction. A basalt core, a boulder and an oak log were found underneath the skull. These may have been used to invert the cranium. A possible hunting and dismemberment scenario is described, drawing on modern and archaeological parallels. These finds corroborate other evidence from the site, which point to sophisticated behaviour by the inhabitants of this region some 500,000 years ago.},

We review the scientific legacy of six topics arising from Wehner’s work on navigation. The polarisation compass is a chapter with a lot of behavioural and neurobiological detail. It has influenced the study of polarisation vision in other systems, and led Wehner to formulate the concept of a matched filter. The matched filter has probably had earlier formulations, but Wehner’s paper on it has been much cited in studies on navigation and in other fields. The polarisation compass serves the task of path integration in insects. Work on path integration took off in the 1980s with work on desert ants and rodents. The use of terrestrial visual cues, landmarks or the panorama in view-based matching is another major theme of navigational research today. Search strategies were also well described in desert ants, and this line of research helped to launch theoretical and empirical developments in searching behaviour, now a lively area of research. Finally, robotic work has often drawn inspiration from work on insect navigation. We end with some discussion of current research directions.},

 abstract = {For cultural reasons and due to the narrow vision of environmental policy makers, most conservation efforts focus on a few charismatic species and consequently neglect the majority of others under threat; many unpopular species are even killed in large numbers with little concern. Redressing this bias through educational programs is therefore important. Snakes are unpopular animals; they suffer from human harassment in most places and many populations have declined worldwide. Consequently, they provide suitable substrate to better improve conservation education in schoolchildren. Responses to a questionnaire administered to 2,570 schoolchildren (7–14 years old) from 10 countries showed that many children liked snakes and that most of the students wanted to see snakes protected. Such counterintuitive results were supported by the explanations given by the children, notably the reasons they liked or disliked snakes. Previous physical contact with snakes was often associated with snake likeability. We also found strong and expected differences between countries: for instance, where venomous snakes represented a health risk, most children declared to be afraid of snakes. Overall, our results negate the simplistic, and previously unverified, adult view that snakes are necessarily perceived as frightening animals, thereby justifying their persecution. This study provides an encouraging message, suggesting that it is not compulsory to focus on charismatic animals to convince children to protect wildlife.},

 abstract = { SUMMARY The author contends that there is no uniform mode of agricultural development. Rather, three major “ideal‐types” have to be distinguished: capitalist agriculture, peasant agriculture, and socialist agriculture. The continuing effectiveness of the first of these as a productive system, especially in its modern form, “agribusiness”, is discussed, as well as its social dysfunctions, as are attempts to develop socialist alternatives, from collectivization to cooperatives, and the continuing peasant dream of independence on one's own family smallholding.   RÉSUMÉ L'auteur soutient qu'il n'y a pas un mode unique de développement agricole, mais qu'il faut plutôt distinguer trois “idéal‐types” principaux: l'agriculture capitaliste, l'agriculture paysanne et l'agriculture socialiste. L'auteur procède alors à la discussion des themes suivants: l'efficacité de l'agriculture capitaliste à travers le temps, et spécialement dans sa forme moderne (“agribusiness”), mais aussi ses effets sociaux néfastes; les essais de développement d'alternatives socialistes, depuis la collectivisation jusqu‘à la coopérative; et l’éternel rêve paysan de l'indépendance à travers l'exploitation familiale.   ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Nach Meinung des Verfassers gibt es keinen einheitlichen Weg der landwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung. Vielmehr müssen drei “Idealtypen” unterschieden werden: kapitalistische Landwirtschaft, bäuerliche Landwirtschaft und sozialistische Landwirtschaft. Die anhaltende Effektivität der ersteren als Produktionssystem, vor allem in ihrer modernen Form, dem “Agribusiness”, wird diskutiert, ebenso deren soziale Unzulänglichkeiten, die Versuchc zur Entwicklung sozialistischer Alternativen von Kollektivierung bis hin zu Genossenschaften und der fortwährende Traum des Bauern von Unabhängigkeit auf dem eigenen kleinen Familienbetrieb. },

 abstract = {This, the second of two articles which examine !Kung San utilization of small mammals, focuses on the “cultural” and subsequent “natural” processes which serve to pattern faunal remains. It demonstrates that these two sets of forces are tightly linked and that it may be impossible for the archaeologist to strip the latter cleanly away to reveal underlying cultural information. Two faunal samples permit examination of the effects of butchering, consumption, duration of site occupation, and length of abandonment on differential element survival. Over the short term in this northern Kalahari Desert sample, selective removal by carnivores constitutes the main cause of differential destruction. Appeal to carnivores is determined by both the nature of an element itself and its cultural treatment. Different methods of breaking, cooking, and consumption may have major effects. Surprisingly, extended site occupation confers protection against carnivores to some classes of bones but not to others. Patterns of differential bone destruction vary between !Kung sites occupied for shorter and longer periods of time. Analysis of sites abandoned up to 32 years indicates that differential survival is affected by both an element's shape and its density. Over time, pieces move downward only and are not churned. They do not sort vertically by size.},

A reanalysis of faunal remains from these excavations suggests that the Spring Creek site is a task-oriented bison processing site occupied for a limited duration in the late summer or early fall. Traditional zooarchaeological methods combined with stable isotope data indicate an archaeofauna dominated by bison from a single herd suggesting a subsistence system where bison hunting is not an unfamiliar activity. These ideas contradict many extant models of Early Archaic subsistence in the central Plains which de-emphasize bison resources in favor of a broad-spectrum foraging strategy. Finally, it is suggested that subsistence models developed for Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers in other areas of North America are not necessarily appropriate for coeval groups on the central Plains.},

 abstract = {Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of work absence, disability, and mortality worldwide. Most of these diseases are associated with low-grade inflammation. Here, we hypothesize that stresses (defined as homeostatic disturbances) can induce low-grade inflammation by increasing the availability of water, sodium, and energy-rich substances to meet the increased metabolic demand induced by the stressor. One way of triggering low-grade inflammation is by increasing intestinal barrier permeability through activation of various components of the stress system. Although beneficial to meet the demands necessary during stress, increased intestinal barrier permeability also raises the possibility of the translocation of bacteria and their toxins across the intestinal lumen into the blood circulation. In combination with modern life-style factors, the increase in bacteria/bacterial toxin translocation arising from a more permeable intestinal wall causes a low-grade inflammatory state. We support this hypothesis with numerous studies finding associations with NCDs and markers of endotoxemia, suggesting that this process plays a pivotal and perhaps even a causal role in the development of low-grade inflammation and its related diseases. },

The preliminary results from excavations at several Late LBK sites in NE Belgium (i.e., the Hesbaye) challenge many traditional notions about the peaceful nature of this colonization and LBK economic and social organization. Three newly-excavated sites in the Hesbaye—Darion, Oleye, and Longchamps—were fortified. Various hypotheses regarding the function of these fortifications are discussed. At present, the most probable is that they were erected to deter raids by indigenous Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, but other plausible hypotheses cannot be entirely excluded. It is also argued that the defense of these sites involved cooperation among several villages. Comparisons between the lithic inventories at these sites and some others nearby indicate that there was village specialization in flint blade and groundstone adze production. Some evidence also suggests village specialization in ceramic production. The homogeneity of adze materials between sites within the Upper Geer “cluster” indicates “pooling” of adze acquisition and centralized redistribution.},

Preliminary Comparative Analysis of Fragmented Human and Animal Bones in the Death Pit at Domuztepe, a Late Neolithic Settlement in Southeastern Turkey. Anthropozoologica 44(1): 159-172. A unique feature at the mid-6th millennium BCE settlement at Domuztepe, Turkey, is a large pit filled predominantly with fragmented human and animal bones. Previous studies have established that the Death Pit animal bone assemblage is characterized by specific features not found in the daily refuse from the rest of the site. The present study seeks further understanding of the Death Pit through a preliminary comparison of the animal and human bone assemblages, including element preservation, degree of fragmentation and breakage patterns. Spatial models of animal and human bones in the Death Pit provide insight into depositional sequencing and the nature of the probable feasting activities that produced this assemblage. Our initial osteological results show that the near identical processing of humans and animals suggests of cannibalism. However, a lower occurrence of fragmentation on human skulls, together with depositional differences between animals and humans, also suggests that conceptual differences between human and animal were maintained.},

 abstract = {Abstract  This paper introduces research at the Mlambalasi rock shelter in the Iringa Region of southern Tanzania. The deposits are composed of a historic and Iron Age occupation, a microlithic Holocene Later Stone Age (LSA), and then a macrolithic Late Pleistocene LSA. Middle Stone Age deposits are also present on the slope in front of the rock shelter. Excavations in A.D. 2002, 2006, and 2010 yielded fragmentary human remains as well as pottery, iron, stone tools, faunal bone, and glass and ostrich eggshell beads. Among the human remains, four individuals are present: two adults and a juvenile were found in the same LSA context, and another adult associated with the Iron Age/historic period. The most complete skeleton is an adult of indeterminate sex that was found in situ in an LSA deposit. Charcoal in proximity to the bone was AMS radiocarbon dated to 12,925 cal BC (OxA‐24620), which is consistent with radiocarbon dates on giant land snail shells from above and below the remains. The skeleton exhibits a series of pathological changes such as extensive dental wear and carious lesions, as well as damage most likely caused by termites, post‐mortem. The most striking aspect of this individual is its small size; stature and body mass estimations place it in the range of historic Khoesan from southern Africa. Consequently, this research adds to the discourse regarding the existence of small‐bodied people in the East African LSA. Findings from this new skeletal sample will contribute to studies of human biology and variation in Africa during the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. },

 abstract = {The hypervariable segment I of the control region of the mtDNA (positions 16024-16383) was amplified from hair roots by PCR and sequenced in 45 unrelated individuals from Anatolia (Asian Turkey). Forty different sequences were found, defined by 56 variable positions, of which only one involves a transversion. The neighbor-joining tree of Kimura's distance matrix for all sequences shows four main clusters. Cluster D was found to be the most statistically robust of the four, and all the sequences in it shared a mutation that is present only in European and West Asian populations. The variability in cluster D could have originated between 37,000 and 107,000 years ago. No branch is unexpectedly long, denoting the absence of sequences that diverged much before the others. The pairwise difference distribution is bell-shaped, in accordance with a population expansion occurring roughly 35,000 to 100,000 years ago. When compared to other Caucasoid populations through the pairwise difference distribution, there is a pattern from the Middle East (older expansion) to the various European populations, with Turkey in an intermediate position; when Turkish sequences are compared through a neighbor-joining tree on a genetic distance matrix of populations, this position is again evidenced. Although there is a very low level of genetic divergence among Caucasoid populations as shown by mtDNA control region sequences, a geographic pattern of genetic variation emerges, denoting a stepping-stone position of Turkey between the Middle East and Europe, which is in agreement with the hypothesis of a replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans, which could be related to the Upper Paleolithic cultural expansion.},

 abstract = {Accessing information on plant consumption before the adoption of agriculture is challenging. However, there is growing evidence for use of locally available wild plants from an increasing number of pre-agrarian sites, suggesting broad ecological knowledge. The extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of raw material preparation through chewing. },

Differences in maternal investment were investigated in relation to socio-environmental variables that may have an impact on the benefit/cost ratio. The factors investigated showed, in general, effects on maternal investment in the expected direction according to the theory: as costs increased, represented by the absence of cohabitation with the father, diminished income and early reproductive age, lower levels of investment were observed. It is concluded that socio-environmental factors may promote or inhibit maternal investment, indicating the importance of public policies in promoting the stability of these variables.},

 abstract = {This chapter examines large-scale patterns of behavioral change that are often viewed as indicators for the advent of cultural modernity and developed symbolic communication. Using examples from Africa and Eurasia, the chapter reviews patterns of lithic and organic technology, subsistence, and settlement as potential indicators of modern behavior. These areas of research produce a mosaic picture of advanced technology and behavioral patterns that come and go during the late Middle and Late Pleistocene. Based on these data the emergence of modern behavior, as seen in the archeologically visible material record, appears to be gradual and heterogeneous in space and time. During the early part of the Late Pleistocene, personal ornaments in the form of sea shells are documented in southwestern Asia and southern Africa. By about 40 thousand years ago (ka), a diverse array of personal ornaments is documented across the Old World in association with Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans in Europe. These include both modified natural objects and fully formed ornaments. The timing and distribution of the appearance of figurative art and other classes of artifacts including musical instruments point to a more punctuated development of fully modern behavior during the middle of the Late Pleistocene, and certainly no later than 40 ka. Due perhaps in part to the long and intense history of research much, but by no means all, of the relevant data come from Europe. Early figurative art from the Aurignacian of southwestern Germany, northern Italy, Austria, and southern France provides undisputed evidence for fully developed symbolic communication and behavioral modernity. This chapter also discusses some of the hypotheses for the development and spread of cultural modernity and rejects a strict monogenetic model in favor of a pattern of highly variable, historically contingent, polygenetic development. This chapter highlights the need for new refutable, regional and superregional hypotheses for the advent and spread of behavioral modernity.},

 abstract = {The length ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D) is a putative marker of prenatal testosterone (T) effects. The number of CAG repeats (CAGn) in the AR gene is negatively correlated with T sensitivity in vitro. Results regarding the relationship between 2D:4D and CAGn are mixed but have featured prominently in arguments for and against the validity of 2D:4D. Here, I present random-effects meta-analyses on 14 relevant samples with altogether 1904 subjects. Results were homogeneous across studies. Even liberal estimates (upper limit of the 95% CI) were close to zero and therefore suggested no substantial relationship of CAGn with either right-hand 2D:4D, left-hand 2D:4D, or the difference between the two. However, closer analysis of the effects of CAGn on T dependent gene activation in vitro and of relationships between CAGn and T dependent phenotypic characteristics suggest that normal variability of CAGn has mostly no, very small, or inconsistent effects. Therefore, the lack of a clear association between CAGn and 2D:4D has no negative implications for the latter's validity as a marker of prenatal T effects. },

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cooperation is indispensable in human societies, and much progress has been made towards understanding human pro-social decisions. Formal incentives, such as punishment, are suggested as potential effective approaches despite the fact that punishment can crowd out intrinsic motives for cooperation and detrimentally impact efficiency. At the same time, evolutionary biologists have long recognized that cooperation, especially food sharing, is typically efficiently organized in groups living on wild foods, even absent formal economic incentives. Despite its evident importance, the source of this voluntary compliance remains largely uninformed. Drawing on costly signaling theory, and in light of the widely established competitive nature of males, we hypothesize that unique and displayable rewards (trophies) out of competition may trigger male generosity in competitive social environments.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we use a controlled laboratory experiment to show that cooperation is sustained in a generosity competition with trophy rewards, but breaks down in the same environment with equally valuable but non-unique and non-displayable rewards. Further, we find that males' competition for trophies is the driving force behind treatment differences. In contrast, it appears that female competitiveness is not modulated by trophy rewards.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest new approaches to promoting cooperation in human groups that, unlike punishment mechanisms, do not sacrifice efficiency. This could have important implications in any domain where voluntary compliance matters--including relations between spouses, employers and employees, market transactions, and conformity to legal standards.},

Evidence from paleosols for past climate and vegetation in East Africa does not support traditional narratives of human evolution during a single transition from primeval forest to dry climate and open grassland. Instead, paleosols indicate climatic oscillations between wet and dry, and alternating expansion of woodland and grassland, since at least 18 Ma (million years ago). Acquisition of dry grassland adaptations such as thick enamel by 18 Ma, adducted hallux by 14 Ma, and cursorial legs by 1.8 Ma, alternated with woodland adaptations such as short stiff back by 16 Ma, erect stance by 6 Ma, and flat face by 3.5 Ma. Our ancestors survived profoundly changing climate and vegetation, with some adaptations lasting only to the next environmental shift, but others proving to be of lasting value.},

 abstract = {During the Early Pleistocene, hominins dispersed from Africa to Eurasia via the Levant. The presence of African taxa in higher latitudes has been interpreted as indicative of an Africa savanna habitat in the Early Pleistocene of the Levant and as support for the hypothesis that the spread of grasslands into higher latitudes promoted the dispersal of hominins into Eurasia. To infer the paleoenvironment of the Levant during the Early Pleistocene, a multivariate analysis based on abundance and presence-absence data of mesoherbivores was used. Results indicate that in the Early Pleistocene, the Levant was situated in a Mediterranean woodland habitat. The presence of African taxa in novel environments may be explained using a long distance dispersal model and suggests that the spatial and temporal abundance pattern of African taxa in the Levant is consistent with the early stages of dispersal and is not indicative of the presence of savanna habitats in higher latitudes. The ecological success of hominins in higher latitudes as attested to by their widespread geographic distribution is consistent with their adaptation to novel environments and suggests that they may have been pre-adapted to variable environments.},

Ultimate explanations for this evolutionary trajectory are best attained through synthetic studies that integrate genetics, biological anthropology, and archaeology, all resting firmly in the field of evolutionary anthropology. These fields of endeavor typically operate in relative isolation. This synthetic overview identifies the three pillars of human uniqueness: an evolved advanced cognition, hyperprosociality, and psychology for social learning. These properties are foundational for cumulative culture, the dominant adaptation of our species. Although the Homo line evolved in the direction of advancing cognition, the evidence shows that only modern humans evolved extreme levels of prosociality and social learning; this review offers an explanation. These three traits were in place ∼200–100 ka and produced a creature capable of extraordinary social and technological structures, but one that was also empowered to make war in large groups with advanced weapons. The advance out of Africa and the annihilation of other hominin taxa, and many unprepared megafauna, were assured.},

 abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that several extinct primates, including contemporaneous Paranthropus boisei and Theropithecus oswaldi in East Africa, fed largely on grasses and sedges (i.e., graminoids). As the only living primate graminivores, gelada monkeys (Theropithecus gelada) can yield insights into the dietary strategies pursued by extinct grass- and sedge-eating primates. Past studies of gelada diet were of short duration and occurred in heavily disturbed ecosystems. We conducted a long-term study of gelada feeding ecology in an intact Afroalpine ecosystem at Guassa, Ethiopia. Geladas at Guassa consumed ≥56 plant species, ≥20 invertebrate species, one reptile species, and the eggs of one bird species over a 7-year period. The annual diet consisted of 56.8% graminoid parts, 37.8% forb parts, 2.8% invertebrates, and 2.6% other items, although geladas exhibited wide variability in diet across months at Guassa. Edible forbs were relatively scarce at Guassa but were strongly selected for by geladas. Tall graminoid leaf and tall graminoid seed head consumption correlated positively, and underground food item consumption correlated negatively, with rainfall over time. Geladas at Guassa consumed a species-rich diet dominated by graminoids, but unlike geladas in more disturbed habitats also ate a diversity of forbs and invertebrates along with occasional vertebrate prey. Although graminoids are staple foods for geladas, underground food items are important "fallback foods." We discuss the implications of our study, the first intensive study of the feeding ecology of the only extant primate graminivore, for understanding the dietary evolution of the theropith and hominin putative graminivores, Theropithecus oswaldi and Paranthropus boisei.},

We specifically investigate the explanatory power of the standard models of Eurasian state formation which emphasize the importance of high population density, inter-state warfare and trade as factors leading to political centralization. We find that while in the whole world sample these factors are indeed positively correlated with political centralization, this is not so in the African sub-sample. Indeed, none of the variables are statistically related to political centralization. We also provide evidence that political centralization, where it took place, was indeed associated with better public goods and development outcomes. We conclude that the evidence is quite consistent with the intellectual tradition initiated in social anthropology by Evans-Pritchard and Fortes in the 1940s which denied the utility of Eurasian models in explaining patterns of political centralization in Africa.},

 abstract = {In a series of papers, we adopted a regional perspective to explore the short and long-term impacts of the Mount Mazama eruption on the plant and animal communities of the northwestern Plains and later developed a model to explain human responses to this natural disaster. The model assumed the convergence of natural disasters which forced the local bison hunters to abandon the impacted zone and to seek refuge among their distant relatives living beyond the eastern limits of their homeland. Together, the refugees and their hosts intensified their subsistence strategies and adapted or developed new methods of food preparation to accommodate the increased pressure on the local resource base. Throughout their stay, the groups continued to monitor the rebirth of their traditional homeland and eventually returned to the places occupied by their ancestors. Upon their return, the groups continued to hunt bison but adapted the stone boiling technology to produce bone grease and pemmican. This nutritious, storable and transportable food source alleviated the concerns about long-term shortages and became an important product in the regional exchange networks. The primary objective of this paper is to test this model using sedimentary, pedological and archaeological data recovered from two deeply stratified sites with evidence of human occupations before and after the eruption of Mount Mazama.},

 abstract = {Helping, i.e. behaviour increasing the fitness of others, can evolve when directed towards kin or reciprocating partners. These predictions have been tested in the context of food sharing both in human foragers and non-human primates. Here, we performed quantitative meta-analyses on 32 independent study populations to (i) test for overall effects of reciprocity on food sharing while controlling for alternative explanations, methodological biases, publication bias and phylogeny and (ii) compare the relative effects of reciprocity, kinship and tolerated scrounging, i.e. sharing owing to costs imposed by others. We found a significant overall weighted effect size for reciprocity of r = 0.20-0.48 for the most and least conservative measure, respectively. Effect sizes did not differ between humans and other primates, although there were species differences in in-kind reciprocity and trade. The relative effect of reciprocity in sharing was similar to those of kinship and tolerated scrounging. These results indicate a significant independent contribution of reciprocity to human and primate helping behaviour. Furthermore, similar effect sizes in humans and primates speak against cognitive constraints on reciprocity. This study is the first to use meta-analyses to quantify these effects on human helping and to directly compare humans and other primates. },

 abstract = {The ecological tolerances of Neandertals, their ability to subsist in the dense forests of full interglacials, and their capacity to colonize northern latitudes are the subject of ongoing debate. The site of Hollerup (northern Denmark) lies at the northern extreme of the Neandertal range. Dated by various techniques to the Eemian interglacial (MIS 5e), this site has yielded the remains of several purportedly butchered fallow deer (Dama dama). Taphonomic reanalysis of the remains from Hollerup and a handful of other Eemian-aged fallow deer skeletons cast doubt on the interpretation that they were humanly modified. We place this revised conclusion into the wider context of human settlement of southern Scandinavia during the Eemian. Other claims of Neandertal presence in the region rest on candidate Middle Paleolithic artifacts, all of which derive from surface contexts. With the fallow deer material removed as a secure indicator of Neandertal settlement of Denmark during the last interglacial, this lithic material must be viewed with renewed skepticism. While ecological and/or topographic factors may have played an important role in preventing Neandertals from penetrating into peninsular Scandinavia, we caution that geological, taphonomic, research-historical, and demographic factors may have significantly distorted our picture of their occupation in this region.},

 abstract = {I report the results of a microscopic study of the bone modification in the identified bovid assemblage from Cave 1 at Klasies River Mouth (KRM), in South Africa. The study was undertaken in an effort to resolve divergent interpretations of the predatory competence of the early modern humans there. The microscopic data suggest that the hominids had relatively unrestricted access to the choicest parts of bovids in all size classes. The carnivore damage signature is ephemeral; it does not support assertions that large carcasses were carnivore-ravaged before their appropriation by hominids or that carnivores contributed a meaningful number of smaller bovids to the faunal assemblage. The data therefore lead to the conclusion that hominids were the sole, regular accumulators of bovids in all size classes. That many of those bovids were obtained by active hunting is suggested by the tip of a stone point embedded in a cervical vertebra of the extinct giant buffalo,Pelorovis antiquus. Finally, some attributes of the butchering patterning hint that the Klasies hominids formed socially mediated task groups to accomplish labour-intensive tasks. These results challenge the general perception that modern morphology pre-dated modern behaviour and the specific assertion that the KRM hominids were behaviourally very primitive. The KRM hominids were apparently active hunters who produced composite tools and who planned and executed complex tasks within a social framework. To the extent that these behaviours presage the modern condition, the KRM hominids were as behaviourally near-modern as they were anatomically near-modern.},

 abstract = {Cut-marks observed on fossil bones and teeth are an important source of evidence in the reconstruction of prehistoric butchery strategies. Micromorphological analyses of cut-marks have been shown to further the interpretation of hominin behavioural patterns. However, to date, the microscopic investigation of cut-marks has been limited to two-dimensional analyses or to the qualitative assessment of three-dimensional (3D) morphology. A new technology using the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope reported here surpasses any current observational or microscopic method for the analysis of cut-marks. By creating a series of image planes and overlapping focus levels to construct a 3D composite image, vertical variations in the surface structure can be used to interpret differences in the mechanical impact caused by different types of tool and different butchery techniques. Three case studies are presented. The first describes cut-marks observed on the human anterior teeth from the Middle Pleistocene site of Boxgrove (West Sussex, England) which are interpreted as indications of two possible types of human behaviour: the use of the mouth as a third hand and postmortem treatment of the body. The second case study, an analysis of cut-marks on human remains at the Later Upper Palaeolithic (Magdalenian) site of Gough's Cave (Somerset, England), questions the interpretation of cannibalism previously accepted for this site by suggesting the hypothesis of burial ritual involving the butchering, but not the consumption, of human bodies. Finally, the butchery techniques adopted at Boxgrove and Gough's Cave are compared. This third study indicates that differences in the micromorphological characteristics of cut-marks reflect diversity in the type of tools used at these two sites.},

 abstract = {Governments and non-govermental organizations (NGOs) that plan projects to conserve the environment and alleviate poverty often attempt to modify rural livelihoods by halting activities they judge to be destructive or inefficient and encouraging alternatives. Project planners typically do so without understanding how rural people themselves judge the value of their activities. When the alternatives planners recommend do not replace the value of banned activities, alternatives are unlikely to be adopted, and local people will refuse to participate. Human behavioral ecology and behavioral economics may provide useful tools for generating and evaluating hypotheses for how people value economic activities in their portfolios and potential alternatives. This is demonstrated with a case example from southwestern Madagascar, where plans to create a Mikea Forest National Park began with the elimination of slash-and-burn maize agriculture and the encouragement to plant labor-intensive manioc instead. Future park plans could restrict access to wild tuber patches, hunting small game, and fishing. The value of these activities is considered using observational data informed by optimal foraging theory, and experimental data describing people’s time preference and covariation perception. Analyses suggest that manioc is not a suitable replacement for maize for many Mikea because the two crops differ in terms of labor requirements, delay-to-reward, and covariation with rainfall. Park planners should promote wild tuber foraging and stewardship of tuber patches and the anthropogenic landscapes in which they are found. To conserve small game, planners must provide alternative sources of protein and cash. Little effort should be spent protecting lemurs, as they are rarely eaten and never sold.},

Aus dem gegenseitigen Kraulen der Menschenaffen erwuchs die für Menschen kennzeichnende sprachliche Zuwendung. Musik und Tanz verstärkten die Bindungen zwischen ihnen.

 abstract = {Over the past few decades the potential role of Mesolithic hunter–gatherers in actively constructing their own niches, through the management of wild plants, has frequently been discussed. It is probable that Mesolithic hunter–gatherers systematically exploited specific woodland resources for food and fuel and influenced the ‘natural’ abundance or distribution of particular species within Mesolithic environments. Though there has been considerable discussion of the pollen evidence for potential small-scale human-woodland manipulation in Mesolithic Scotland, the archaeobotanical evidence for anthropogenic firewood and food selection has not been discussed in this context. This paper assesses the evidence for the active role of Mesolithic hunter–gatherer communities in systematically exploiting and managing woodlands for food and fuel in Scotland. While taphonomic factors may have impacted on the frequency of specific species in archaeobotanical assemblages, it is suggested that hunter–gatherers in Mesolithic Scotland were systematically using woodland plants, and in particular hazel and oak, for food and fuel. It is argued that the pollen evidence for woodland management is equivocal, but hints at the role of hunter–gatherers in shaping the structure of their environments, through the maintenance or creation of woodland clearings for settlement or as part of vegetation management strategies. It is proposed that Mesolithic hunter–gatherers may have actively contributed to niche construction and that the systematic use of hazel and oak as a fuel may reflect the deliberate pruning of hazel trees to increase nut-yields and the inadvertent – or perhaps deliberate – coppicing of hazel and oak during greenwood collection.},

We show that smaller societies are less generous in the Dictator Game but no less prone to 2PP in the Ultimatum Game. We might assume people everywhere would be more willing to punish someone who hurt them directly (2PP) than someone who hurt an anonymous third person (3PP). While this is true of small societies, people in large societies are actually more likely to engage in 3PP than 2PP. Strong reciprocity, including generous offers and 3PP, exists mostly in large, complex societies that face numerous challenging collective action problems. We argue that 'spiteful' 2PP, motivated by the basic emotion of anger, is more universal than 3PP and sufficient to explain the origins of human cooperation.},

 abstract = {Human hunting is arguably one of the most difficult activities common to foraging peoples now and in the past. Children and teenagers have usually been described as incompetent hunters in ethnographies of hunter-gatherers. This paper explores the extent to which adult-level competence is limited more by the constraints of physical capital, or body size, and brain-based capital, or skills and learning. The grandmother hypothesis requires that production is an increasing function of size alone, while the embodied capital model stipulates that production is a function of both size and delayed learning. Tests based on observational, interview, and experimental data collected among Tsimane Amerindians of the Bolivian Amazon suggest that size alone cannot explain the long delay until peak hunting productivity. Indirect encounters (e.g., smells, sounds, tracks, and scat) and shooting of stationary targets are two components of hunting ability limited primarily by physical size alone, but the more difficult components of hunting--direct encounters with important prey items and successful capture--require substantial skill. Those skills can take an additional ten to twenty years to develop after achieving adult body size.},

 abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has consistently been shown to be the most genetically diverse region in the world. Despite the fact that a substantial portion of this variation is partitioned between groups practicing a variety of subsistence strategies and speaking diverse languages, there is currently no consensus on the genetic relationships of sub-Saharan African populations. San (a subgroup of KhoeSan) and many Pygmy groups maintain hunter-gatherer lifestyles and cluster together in autosomal-based analysis, whereas non-Pygmy Niger-Kordofanian speakers (non-Pygmy NKs) predominantly practice agriculture and show substantial genetic homogeneity despite their wide geographic range throughout sub-Saharan Africa. However, KhoeSan, who speak a set of relatively unique click-based languages, have long been thought to be an early branch of anatomically modern humans based on phylogenetic analysis. To formally test models of divergence among the ancestors of modern African populations, we resequenced a sample of San, Eastern, and Western Pygmies and non-Pygmy NKs individuals at 40 nongenic (∼2 kb) regions and then analyzed these data within an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We find substantial support for a model of an early divergence of KhoeSan ancestors from a proto-Pygmy-non-Pygmy NKs group ∼110 thousand years ago over a model incorporating a proto-KhoeSan-Pygmy hunter-gatherer divergence from the ancestors of non-Pygmy NKs. The results of our analyses are consistent with previously identified signals of a strong bottleneck in Mbuti Pygmies and a relatively recent expansion of non-Pygmy NKs. We also develop a number of methodologies that utilize "pseudo-observed" data sets to optimize our ABC-based inference. This approach is likely to prove to be an invaluable tool for demographic inference using genome-wide resequencing data.},

@article{pub.1049918260,
 abstract = {The present article examines several lines of converging evidence suggesting that the slow and insidious brain changes that accumulate over the lifespan, resulting in both natural cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent a metabolism reduction program. A number of such adaptive programs are known to accompany aging and are thought to have decreased energy requirements for ancestral hunter-gatherers in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Foraging ability in modern hunter-gatherers declines rapidly, more than a decade before the average terminal age of 55 years. Given this, the human brain would have been a tremendous metabolic liability that must have been advantageously tempered by the early cellular and molecular changes of AD which begin to accumulate in all humans during early adulthood. Before the recent lengthening of life span, individuals in the ancestral environment died well before this metabolism reduction program resulted in clinical AD, thus there was never any selective pressure to keep adaptive changes from progressing to a maladaptive extent.Aging foragers may not have needed the same cognitive capacities as their younger counterparts because of the benefits of accumulated learning and life experience. It is known that during both childhood and adulthood metabolic rate in the brain decreases linearly with age. This trend is thought to reflect the fact that children have more to learn. AD "pathology" may be a natural continuation of this trend. It is characterized by decreasing cerebral metabolism, selective elimination of synapses and reliance on accumulating knowledge (especially implicit and procedural) over raw brain power (working memory). Over decades of subsistence, the behaviors of aging foragers became routinized, their motor movements automated and their expertise ingrained to a point where they no longer necessitated the first-rate working memory they possessed when younger and learning actively. Alzheimer changes selectively and precisely mediate an adaptation to this major life-history transition.AD symptomatology shares close similarities with deprivation syndromes in other animals including the starvation response. Both molecular and anatomical features of AD imitate brain changes that have been conceptualized as adaptive responses to low food availability in mammals and birds. Alzheimer's patients are known to express low overall metabolic rates and are genetically inclined to exhibit physiologically thrifty traits widely thought to allow mammals to subsist under conditions of nutritional scarcity. Additionally, AD is examined here in the contexts of anthropology, comparative neuroscience, evolutionary medicine, expertise, gerontology, neural Darwinism, neuroecology and the thrifty genotype.},

 abstract = {Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build ``geogenetic maps,'' which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT    Evidence of late Early Pleistocene elephant butchery activity has been excavated in the Pit 1 locality at Barranc de la Boella (Catalonia, Spain). The fossil assemblage mainly comprises the remains of one prime adult individual of Mammuthus meridionalis , together with 125 lithic artefacts, among which several refitting groups of chert have been identified. The lithic assemblage from the Pit 1 locality is composed of cobbles, cores, simple and retouched flakes, together with a large, well‐fashioned pick of hard‐wearing schist. Spatial, zooarchaeological, taphonomic, technical and use‐wear analyses confirm that the occupation was devoted to butchery of the mammoth carcass. The activity zone is in a fluvio‐deltaic area that incises the terrace T+60 of the lower Francolí river basin, 50 m a.s.l. Palaeomagnetic and cosmogenic analyses, as well as microfaunal ( Mimomys savini , Victoriamys chalinei ) and macrofaunal biostratigraphy ( Mammuthus meridionalis ), support the timing of the occupation to the late Matuyama chron. These various lines of evidence point to Barranc de la Boella being the oldest Early Acheulean butchering site in Europe. Ongoing excavations at several localities at Barranc de la Boella are yielding new data on the palaeoenvironmental, geochronological and technological framework of these occupations. Finally, the evidence is integrated into current understanding of the subsistence strategies practised by Early Pleistocene hominins.  },

 abstract = { The Levantine Corridor was one of the most important contact zones between Africa and Eurasia during the Pleistocene and, as a consequence, a potential area in which to detect population dispersals. Culturally, after approximately 1Ma of the Lower and early Middle Pleistocene Acheulean, the Levant showed significant innovative changes with the onset of the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) dating to the second half of the Middle Pleistocene. However, zooarchaeological evidence concerning the AYCC consists of a small set of data given the rarity of localities with well-preserved faunal assemblages. Qesem Cave (near Tel Aviv, Israel) constitutes an important exception, as its AYCC deposits, covering a time span of over 200kya (420–200kya), are well-preserved and yield massive faunal assemblages. Here, we present taphonomical data of a faunal assemblage originating from a very special context, a central, superimposed hearth, dated somewhat earlier than 300kya. The faunal assemblage is dominated by Dama cf. mesopotamica, followed by Cervus cf. elaphus. The ungulate mortality pattern is dominated by adult-aged individuals, and in the case of Mesopotamian fallow deer, the wide age range lead us to propose the development of social hunting techniques and seasonal occupations. The assemblage appears to have been generated solely by humans occupying the cave and was primarily modified by their food-processing activities, pointing to the importance of marrow in hominin transport decisions. This study adds new zooarchaeological data to those published previously and attempts to deepen our knowledge of human subsistence behaviour at Qesem Cave, while offering some insights into the economic and social life at AYCC Qesem Cave in the southern Levant.},

 abstract = {Grotte XVI (Dordogne, France) contains a rich archaeological sequence that begins during the Mousterian and continues through the Magdalenian and includes Châtelperronian and early Aurignacian assemblages. Analyses of the ungulates from this site show no significant change in skeletal part representation, butchering intensity (as measured by cut mark numbers and placement), degree of bone fragmentation, and intensity of carnivore damage across the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition. Relative taxonomic abundances of ungulates change significantly from the Mousterian to the early Aurignacian, but these changes are consistent with climatic forcing and continue throughout the sequence. Only the Magdalenian ungulate assemblage is clearly distinct from all others when examined in terms of these variables, perhaps because of altered predator/prey ratios on the local landscape. Cave bear relative abundances decline precipitously across the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition; this decline may reflect increased human residence times and/or group sizes during this interval, just as Kurtén observed many years ago.},

 abstract = {Nuclear genome sequence data from Neandertals, Denisovans, and archaic anatomically modern humans can be used to complement our understanding of hominin evolutionary biology and ecology through i) direct inference of archaic hominin phenotypes, ii) indirect inference of those phenotypes by identifying the effects of previously-introgressed alleles still present among modern humans, or iii) determining the evolutionary timing of relevant hominin-specific genetic changes. Here we review and reanalyze published Neandertal and Denisovan genome sequence data to illustrate an example of the third approach. Specifically, we infer the timing of five human gene presence/absence changes that may be related to particular hominin-specific dietary changes and discuss these results in the context of our broader reconstructions of hominin evolutionary ecology. We show that pseudogenizing (gene loss) mutations in the TAS2R62 and TAS2R64 bitter taste receptor genes and the MYH16 masticatory myosin gene occurred after the hominin-chimpanzee divergence but before the divergence of the human and Neandertal/Denisovan lineages. The absence of a functional MYH16 protein may explain our relatively reduced jaw muscles; this gene loss may have followed the adoption of cooking behavior. In contrast, salivary amylase gene (AMY1) duplications were not observed in the Neandertal and Denisovan genomes, suggesting a relatively recent origin for the AMY1 copy number gains that are observed in modern humans. Thus, if earlier hominins were consuming large quantities of starch-rich underground storage organs, as previously hypothesized, then they were likely doing so without the digestive benefits of increased salivary amylase production. Our most surprising result was the observation of a heterozygous mutation in the first codon of the TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor gene in the Neandertal individual, which likely would have resulted in a non-functional protein and inter-individual PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) taste sensitivity variation, as also observed in both humans and chimpanzees. },

 abstract = {The faunal assemblages excavated by Mary Leakey in Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, have, like the more well-known Bed I assemblages, traditionally been interpreted as the result of hominid butchering activities in the lake margin and riverine settings of the paleo-Olduvai Basin. A reexamination of all of Leakey's Bed I sites has shown that hominids played little or no role in the formation of all but one of those faunal assemblages, a finding that prompted the reanalysis of the Bed II sites presented here. We expand upon a previous taphonomic study that provided systematic data for HWK East Levels 1-2, MNK Main, and BK. In addition to these assemblages, we provide data on HWK East Levels 3-5, FC West, TK, and SHK. Our data contradict previous interpretations of MNK Main as a hominid accumulation but uphold the contention that BK represents a primarily hominid accumulation reflecting early access to carcasses. The small and poorly preserved assemblages from FC West and TK are difficult to link unambiguously to either hominids or carnivores. Site MNK Main and HWK East Levels 3-5 appear to be death arenas where carcasses accumulated via natural deaths and/or serial predation. Site SHK is severely biased by selective retention and therefore little can be said of its formational history. Nevertheless, no hominid modifications were documented in this assemblage. Comparisons with other Olduvai sites indicate a more conspicuous hyena taphonomic signal during Bed II times than Bed I times, which appears to mirror the changing configuration of the large carnivore guild. These findings also beg the question of what activities were being carried out by hominids with the stone tools discarded at these sites. Although it seems clear that hominids were utilizing stone tools to carry out subsistence activities unrelated to carcass butchery, more excavation and techniques such as phytolith analysis should be employed to explore alternative explanations.},

The goal of this analysis is to study the relationship between human foraging economies and human-related environmental change in southern New Zealand. Foraging theory is used to generate predictions about subsistence change resulting from the declining abundance of important resources such as moas and seals. In particular, these predictions examine changes in (1) the kind of resources exploited (foraging efficiency), (2) the number of resources utilized (diet breadth), and (3) the habitats exploited (patch choice). The predictions are tested using the large assemblage of vertebrate faunal remains from the well-stratified and well-dated Shag River Mouth site. This study shows that using foraging theory models to structure analysis provides a more fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution of subsistence change in southern New Zealand than has been previously achieved.},

The Bacteroidales family S24-7 is a prominent example of one of these groups. Marker gene surveys indicate that members of this family are highly localized to the gastrointestinal tracts of homeothermic animals and are increasingly being recognized as a numerically predominant member of the gut microbiota; however, little is known about the nature of their interactions with the host.ResultsHere, we provide the first whole genome exploration of this family, for which we propose the name “Candidatus Homeothermaceae,” using 30 population genomes extracted from fecal samples of four different animal hosts: human, mouse, koala, and guinea pig. We infer the core metabolism of “Ca. Homeothermaceae” to be that of fermentative or nanaerobic bacteria, resembling that of related Bacteroidales families. In addition, we describe three trophic guilds within the family, plant glycan (hemicellulose and pectin), host glycan, and α-glucan, each broadly defined by increased abundance of enzymes involved in the degradation of particular carbohydrates.Conclusions“Ca. Homeothermaceae” representatives constitute a substantial component of the murine gut microbiota, as well as being present within the human gut, and this study provides important first insights into the nature of their residency. The presence of trophic guilds within the family indicates the potential for niche partitioning and specific roles for each guild in gut health and dysbiosis.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT  In Europe, the bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus is currently an endangered species limited now to high mountain areas, but had a broader geographical distribution in the past. It breeds on ledges in limestone cliffs, in habitats similar to those also selected by prehistoric human groups. This species feeds mainly on bones of medium‐sized ungulates that are processed before ingestion at bone‐breaking sites or ossuaries; bone remains subsequently accumulate at their nesting places leading to potential mixing with human‐derived or carnivore‐derived assemblages. This fact could lead to incorrect palaeoeconomic interpretations that can be avoided if the taphonomic contribution of this bird of prey is correctly identified. Here, we present some key features to distinguish its presence in archaeo/palaeontological contexts. Bone surface alterations, breakage patterns and skeletal profiles are recorded. Several prehistoric, historic and modern assemblages accumulated by bearded vultures are studied. In addition, a new utility index based on bearded vulture dietary preferences that can be compared with skeletal element abundance in terms of %MAU (Minimal Animal Units) has been defined.

 abstract = {Bolomor Cave, located in Tavernes de la Valldigna (Valencia, Spain), contains a sedimentary deposit composed of seventeen stratigraphic levels ranging from MIS 9 to MIS 5e. This extensive sequence allows us to ask different questions about how the human groups of this chronological period related to their environment. We report several different strategies by which animal resources were obtained from level XII faunal assemblage (MIS 6). These practices range from scavenging to the complex hunting techniques, such as multiple predation. This practice is inferred in the case of horses (Equus ferus) on the basis of: (1) the proportional representation of skeletal elements (elements with high marrow content, such as stylopodials and zeugopodials); (2) age at death of these animals (from infantile to advanced adult); (3) the position and function of cutmarks and toothmarks (mainly oblique and longitudinal incisions on limb bones diaphyses); (4) archaeostratigraphic distribution of their remains in the assemblage; and (5) presence of refits among the bones located at this archaeostratigraphical line. Evidence of anthropogenic processing of small prey (Oryctolagus cuniculus and Cygnus olor) is also identified at level XII. These discoveries imply the development of techniques different from those used to capture large and medium ungulates. From this perspective, a variety of strategies to obtain animal food can be documented at Bolomor Cave. This phenomenon can be related to the highly adaptive subsistence strategies of these hominids, who could take advantage of the benefits offered by a diverse and rich environment. In general, the aim of this study is to provide data about the subsistence strategies of human groups from Bolomor Cave and contribute to knowledge about the human groups’ way of life of in the late Middle Pleistocene.},

 abstract = {Gut microbiota richness and stability are important parameters in host-microbe symbiosis. Diet modification, notably using dietary fibres, might be a way to restore a high richness and stability in the gut microbiota. In this work, during a 6-week nutritional trial, 19 healthy adults consumed a basal diet supplemented with 10 or 40 g dietary fibre per day for 5 days, followed by 15-day washout periods. Fecal samples were analysed by a combination of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, intestinal cell genotoxicity assay, metatranscriptomics sequencing approach and short-chain fatty analysis. This short-term change in the dietary fibre level did not have the same impact for all individuals but remained significant within each individual gut microbiota at genus level. Higher microbiota richness was associated with higher microbiota stability upon increased dietary fibre intake. Increasing fibre modulated the expression of numerous microbiota metabolic pathways such as glycan metabolism, with genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes active on fibre or host glycans. High microbial richness was also associated with high proportions of Prevotella and Coprococcus species and high levels of caproate and valerate. This study provides new insights on the role of gut microbial richness in healthy adults upon dietary changes and host microbes' interaction. },

The effect on our results of the possible presence at Atapuerca of some large carnivores not recorded in the fossil assemblage is also evaluated. Results indicate the existence of a rich ecosystem at Atapuerca at the end of the Early Pleistocene. Secondary production was abundant enough to maintain a hunter-gatherer population and a rich carnivore guild more diverse than that recorded in the TD6 assemblage. Based on these results, the practice of cannibalism by H. antecessor cannot be explained by a long-term scarcity of resources. High food availability at TD6 implies a low to moderate level of competition for resources between carnivores and humans. According to this interpretation, an empty niche for a highly carnivorous omnivore existed in Europe during the early Galerian, and it was successfully exploited by Homo.},

 abstract = {Although several investigations have addressed the nature of communication in men's relationships with their sons, relatively few have focused on positive interaction patterns, such as the exchange of affection, even though affection is of considerable importance to relational maintenance and satisfaction. According to affection exchange theory, affection is such a valuable relational resource because of the contributions it makes to humans’ long‐term viability and reproductive success. As such a resource, it should, thus, be governed by adaptive motivations, among which is the motivation for parents to invest in their children in ways that maximize their long‐term evolutionary success. Using the theory of discriminative parental solicitude, we predicted differences in the amount of affection men communicate to their biological sons, adopted sons, and step‐sons. We tested our predictions in two studies involving a total of 384 males. We discuss implications of the results for explaining the superordinate evolutionary motivations governing affectionate communication.},

I use studies of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), a classic example of extravagant armaments and ornaments in animals, to exemplify how a long-term, multidisciplinary approach that integrates field observations with laboratory methods can contribute to on-going theoretical debates in the field of sexual selection. I begin with a brief summary of the main concepts of sexual selection theory and the differences between the sexes. I then introduce mandrills and the study population and review mandrill life history, the ontogeny of sex differences, and maternal effects. Next, I focus on male-male competition and female choice, followed by the less well-studied questions of female-female competition and male choice. This review shows how different reproductive priorities lead to very different life histories and divergent adaptations in males and females. It demonstrates how broadening traditional perspectives on sexual selection beyond the ostentatious results of intense sexual selection on males leads to an understanding of more subtle and cryptic forms of competition and choice in both sexes and opens many productive avenues in the study of primate reproductive strategies. These include the potential for studies of postcopulatory selection, female intrasexual competition, and male choice. These studies of mandrills provide comparison and, I hope, inspiration for studies of both other polygynandrous species and species with mating systems less traditionally associated with sexual selection.},

In particular, starting from Plato and Sir Thomas More, it explores what place (if any) has been envisaged for medicine in a utopian society. By way of an explanatory device, predictions concerning medicine are compared and contrasted with expectations as to the role of the sciences, natural and social. Investigation of the corpus of social prognostications in fact reveals a dearth of glorious expectations for the future of medicine as such, though certain writings have held out great hopes for biologistic disciplines, such as eugenics. It is often in ‘golden age’ fantasies about the early history of humankind that the most glowing descriptions of complete health are painted. Similarly, perfect health is something often viewed not in social but in individualistic terms. Explanations are offered of these perhaps slightly surprising facts.},

 abstract = {In many parts of the Mediterranean Basin, resource intensification occurred across the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition, and again before the beginning of the Mesolithic. Central to understanding resource intensification is distinguishing human demographic pressures from environmental factors. This paper examines the intensification of vertebrate resources at Klissoura Cave 1 in the Peloponnese, Greece, from marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 5a until the early Holocene (from about 80,000 to 10,000 years ago) against the backdrop of changing environments. Occasional fluctuations in large game resources, as well as changing proportions of certain small game (e.g. great bustard) correlate to environmental shifts in the eastern Mediterranean during the Late Pleistocene. Prey choice models are used to understand human demographic pressures and resource intensification. Small game animals are ranked according to these models, with slow-moving species (e.g. tortoises) classified as higher-ranking and fast-moving species (e.g. hares and birds) categorized as low-ranking. Two major shifts are apparent in the sequence. The first is an overall increase in the use of small game animals in the Upper Paleolithic and later diets as compared to ungulate prey. The second is a decrease in higher-ranked small game and a corresponding increase in low-ranked small game animals. These trends are evident using either number of identified specimen (NISP) counts or proxy measures of prey biomass. An application of diversity indices indicates that there is no temporal trend in prey evenness, though fluctuations in evenness values have different meanings for ungulate and small-bodied prey. An increase in evenness of ungulate species typically correlates with climatic amelioration. Increasing evenness values for small game animals, however, are related to environmental factors in some instances, and changes in human exploitation patterns in other cases.},

 abstract = {Neotaphonomic studies of large carnivores are used to create models in order to explain the formation of terrestrial vertebrate fossil faunas. The research reported here adds to the growing body of knowledge on the taphonomic consequences of large carnivore behavior in temperate habitats and has important implications for paleontology and archaeology. Using photo- and videotrap data, we were able to describe the consumption of 17 ungulate carcasses by wild brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos) ranging the Spanish Pyrenees. Further, we analyzed the taphonomic impact of these feeding bouts on the bones recovered from those carcasses. The general sequence of consumption that we charted starts with separation of a carcass's trunk; viscera are generally eaten first, followed by musculature of the humerus and femur. Long limb bones are not broken open for marrow extraction. Bears did not transport carcasses or carcass parts from points of feeding and did not disperse bones appreciably (if at all) from their anatomical positions. The general pattern of damage that resulted from bear feeding includes fracturing, peeling, crenulation, tooth pitting and scoring of axial and girdle elements and furrowing of the upper long limb bones. As predicted from observational data, the taphonomic consequences of bear feeding resemble those of other non-durophagus carnivores, such as felids, and are distinct from those of durophagus carnivores, such as hyenids. Our results have paleontological and archaeological relevance. Specifically, they may prove useful in building analogical models for interpreting the formation of fossil faunas for which bears are suspected bone accumulators and/or modifiers. More generally, our comparative statistical analyses draw precise quantitative distinctions between bone damage patterns imparted respectively by durophagus (modelled here primarily by spotted hyenas [Crocuta crocuta] and wolves [Canis lupus]) and non-durophagus (modelled here by brown bears and lions [Panthera leo]) carnivorans. },

 abstract = {What makes humans unique? This question has fascinated scientists and philosophers for centuries and it is still a matter of intense debate. Nowadays, human brain expansion during evolution has been acknowledged to explain our empowered cognitive capabilities. The drivers for such accelerated expansion remain, however, largely unknown. In this sense, studies have suggested that the cooking of food could be a pre-requisite for the expansion of brain size in early hominins. However, this appealing hypothesis is only supported by a mathematical model suggesting that the increasing number of neurons in the brain would constrain body size among primates due to a limited amount of calories obtained from diets. Here, we show, by using a similar mathematical model, that a tradeoff between body mass and the number of brain neurons imposed by dietary constraints during hominin evolution is unlikely. Instead, the predictable number of neurons in the hominin brain varies much more in function of foraging efficiency than body mass. We also review archeological data to show that the expansion of the brain volume in the hominin lineage is described by a linear function independent of evidence of fire control, and therefore, thermal processing of food does not account for this phenomenon. Finally, we report experiments in mice showing that thermal processing of meat does not increase its caloric availability in mice. Altogether, our data indicate that cooking is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain hominin brain expansion. },

 abstract = {The biological status and biomedical significance of the concept of race as applied to humans continue to be contentious issues despite the use of advanced statistical and clustering methods to determine continental ancestry. It is thus imperative for researchers to understand the limitations as well as potential uses of the concept of race in biology and biomedicine. This paper deals with the theoretical assumptions behind cluster analysis in human population genomics. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, it demonstrates that the hypothesis that attributes the clustering of human populations to "frictional" effects of landform barriers at continental boundaries is empirically incoherent. It then contrasts the scientific status of the "cluster" and "cline" constructs in human population genomics, and shows how cluster may be instrumentally produced. It also shows how statistical values of race vindicate Darwin's argument that race is evolutionarily meaningless. Finally, the paper explains why, due to spatiotemporal parameters, evolutionary forces, and socio-cultural factors influencing population structure, continental ancestry may be pragmatically relevant to global and public health genomics. Overall, this work demonstrates that, from a biological systematic and evolutionary taxonomical perspective, human races/continental groups or clusters have no natural meaning or objective biological reality. In fact, the utility of racial categorizations in research and in clinics can be explained by spatiotemporal parameters, socio-cultural factors, and evolutionary forces affecting disease causation and treatment response. },

The assumption, however, is rarely tested directly. In this paper, we develop a method to test for assortment of prosociality in network-structured data. The method is applied to a friendship network collected from 238 Korean students attending the same high school. A mixing matrix was used to explore the presence of assortative friendship among more prosocial individuals. An exponential random graph model of network structure that accounts for additional observed relational propensities (higher-than-expected number of people nominating no friends) and sampling constraints (upper bound on friendship nominations) found that individual prosociality predicted friendship propensity, and that individuals with higher prosocial scores had a higher probability of befriending other more prosocial individuals. The results reveal that a considerable level of assortment of prosociality characterizes this population. },

For recent overviews of these subjects, see Plummer (2004), Schick and Toth (2006) as well as papers in Toth and Schick (2006), Ungar (2007) and Hovers and Braun (2009). The coincidence of knapped stone tools, butchery-marked bones and fossil remains of early Homo is usually linked to increased hominin carnivory. This paper reviews evidence for this hypothesis, and considers alternative hypotheses as well.},

 abstract = {Large-scale societies in which strangers regularly engage in mutually beneficial transactions are puzzling. The evolutionary mechanisms associated with kinship and reciprocity, which underpin much of primate sociality, do not readily extend to large unrelated groups. Theory suggests that the evolution of such societies may have required norms and institutions that sustain fairness in ephemeral exchanges. If that is true, then engagement in larger-scale institutions, such as markets and world religions, should be associated with greater fairness, and larger communities should punish unfairness more. Using three behavioral experiments administered across 15 diverse populations, we show that market integration (measured as the percentage of purchased calories) positively covaries with fairness while community size positively covaries with punishment. Participation in a world religion is associated with fairness, although not across all measures. These results suggest that modern prosociality is not solely the product of an innate psychology, but also reflects norms and institutions that have emerged over the course of human history.},

 abstract = {Abstract. Meat sharing in non-human primates has been linked to a variety of functions, including harassment reduction, mate provisioning and status enhancement. We present observational data regarding male prey capture and male–female meat sharing in wild Guinea baboons. Guinea baboons live in a multilevel society that comprises units of males with associated females and, sometimes, secondary males. Several males of different units maintain strong bonds, resulting in the formation of parties within gangs. Female–male relationships persist irrespective of female reproductive states, yet females may also switch between males at all stages of the reproductive cycle. Our data show that males capture and kill a variety of prey, including hares and antelope. Males shared meat passively only with females in their social and reproductive units. The occurrence of oestrus females in the gang did not influence whether or not sharing would occur in that males did not share with oestrus females unless an affiliative relationship already persisted, indicating that short-term currency exchanges of meat for sex are unlikely. We hypothesise that males may benefit from feeding tolerance by retaining females, while females may increase access to potentially nutritious and rare food sources. Alternatively, females may prefer males that are generally less aggressive and thus also more likely to share meat. Long-term data will be needed to ultimately distinguish between the two accounts. Although there is no evidence that males intentionally provide necessary resources to particular females during times of high energetic demands and decreased foraging efficiency, as has been found in humans, and meat sharing is generally rare, it may have subtle, yet important effects on the maintenance of bonds in Guinea baboons.},

The tool provides a dynamic graphical and auditory interface in which users encounter different prey animals and then must decide whether to pursue or ignore the encountered prey. Based on the characteristics of the prey in the foraging environment and the decisions of the player, each user harvests a set of prey per round and achieves a corresponding foraging return rate. Administrators of Pursuit specify the environmental parameters that determine what prey users will encounter. All environmental parameters and user decisions are tracked and logged for analysis. We created this tool for laboratory experiments, but we believe Pursuit could also be an engaging and effective teaching tool, whereby students adopt the role of forager, and through such play, experience a simulated foraging context and learn about foraging theory. Pursuit is freely available and can run on any platform that supports Java, including Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.},

Evidence for the paleoenvironmental context of one well-studied early Pleistocene site, FxJj 50, Koobi Fora, is compared with data from field studies of the abundance of plant foods in selected modern habitats in Kenya. Examples of the spatial distribution and seasonal availability of some edible fruits near two channels in arid parts of Kenya illustrate ways in which plant food foraging opportunities vary in arid riparian habitats today.

 abstract = {Biomolecules, in particular DNA, assist us in generating and testing hypotheses about human evolutionary history. Molecular analyses testing for and then utilizing a local molecular clock can inform us as to the timing of the split between different lineages or populations. When applied to the split between hominins and chimpanzees, for instance, the molecular clock estimates of their divergence date place constraints on interpretations of the growing fossil record from the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene. The pattern and distribution of modern human variation can be used to extrapolate back in time to infer when and where the modern human gene pool arose. Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome sequences and markers have been extensively surveyed in populations from around the world. Numerous nuclear loci and other markers, such as microsatellites and Alu insertions, have similarly been sampled and analyzed. More recently, high-throughput massively parallel sequencing technologies have allowed for the characterization of hundreds of human and nonhuman primate complete genomes. The majority of such analyses point toward a relatively recent origin for modern human diversity from a small population in Africa within the last 200 Ka, with a subsequent dispersal into Eurasia less than 100 Ka though there is some debate as to the timing of these events. While analyses of ancient mitochondrial sequences from archaic hominins strongly suggest that archaic females did not contribute to the modern human mitochondrial gene pool, whole-genome sequences of two archaic populations suggest limited interbreeding with modern humans in Eurasia but not Africa. Analyses of modern African genomes suggest that some populations also interbred with an as yet unknown archaic population or populations. Thus, while a complete replacement of archaic populations by African-derived modern humans is no longer fully tenable, only a limited amount interbreeding between anatomically modern human populations and archaic forebears is likely to have taken place.},

 abstract = {Tool-using hominids, as carnivorous animals, would have been part of the various carnivore guilds present in Plio-Pleistocene Africa. Hominid dietary strategies must be understood within the larger context of carnivore behavior and ecology, as carnivorans could have affected the abilities of hominids to procure meat and/or marrow. The functional anatomy of extant and fossil carnivorans was examined to infer behaviors in fossil carnivorans that would have impacted on hominid dietary strategies in terms of carcass availability. Comparisons of guild structure were carried out to examine changes in carnivoran interactions and their implications for hominid behavior. Plio-Pleistocene carnivorans engaged in a wider range of behaviors than modern carnivorans. The sabertoothed felids Dinofelis and Megantereon probably did not provide much larger carcasses than modern species. Another sabertooth, Homotherium generated larger carcasses, but may have disarticulated and transported these carcasses. Fossil representatives of modern taxa may not have been equivalent ecologically within the carnivoran guild. Overall, hominids in eastern Africa probably had a greater range of scavenging opportunities than did those of southern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene. Local and continent-wide extinction events in large-bodied carnivoran guilds from 1 to 2 Ma had a substantial effect on carcass availability and the risk to hominid scavengers. These structural changes in the carnivore guild may have provided an opportunity for hominids to widen their niche with respect to dietary behavior.},

The former apparently took place between 10,200 and 10,900 years ago. Bison bone from the sites has not proven suitable for reliable radiocarbon dating, a problem that is recurrent at southern Plains sites of this age. At both sites there seemingly was a period of relatively rapid valley and gully-infilling soon after the Folsom occupations occurred. At the Lipscomb site, the present surface apparently stablized and soil formation began about 7000 years ago. At the Waugh site, a deeply buried hearth some 100 m from the primary bone bed provided the only radiometric dates. The spatial relationship of Folsom kill-butchery and camp activities at Waugh holds important implications for the investigation and interpretation of other Folsom sites.},

Its age makes it a key site for studying the behavior of the early hominin groups of the Iberian Peninsula and western Europe and the ecological context in which they developed.At La Mina locality, three archaeostratigraphic levels have been identified, with level 2 being the richest in terms of the archaeological remains recovered. It exhibits high taxonomic diversity, with the most common taxa belonging to open and partially open habitats, although aquatic and riparian taxa have also been identified. Carnivore remains are present, although scarce. Coprolites from a hyaenid have also been found.Both hominin and carnivore activity has been documented at the site. Evidence of carnivore activity suggests at least one bone-cracking carnivore had access to the assemblage. The anatomical ratios employed suggest that La Mina was formed at a time of high competition (intra and/or inter-specific), with a high number of predators in this ecological context. Anthropic activity in a highly competitive context might suggest that these hominin groups had a high degree of control over the environment and over local resources, as has been shown at other Early Pleistocene sites.},

Here, we present the results of a taphonomic and zooarchaeological analysis of Klipdrift Shelter to investigate subsistence strategies during the Late Pleistocene. In particular, we focus on the taphonomic history of the assemblage. Our analysis shows that the Klipdrift Shelter faunal assemblage is extensively fragmented; probably as a result of anthropogenic processing and post-depositional alteration. As a result, little significant information can be extrapolated from the analysis of skeletal-part abundance per layer. Human involvement in the accumulation of ungulate, small mammal, carnivore and tortoise remains is apparent in all layers. We show evidence of disarticulation, marrow extraction, skinning, filleting and carnivore consumption and document the processing of low-ranked game and elements.

The aim of this study was to analyse how the biodiversity of saproxylic organisms (fungi, lichens, beetles, and ants, bees and wasps) in thermophilic temperate oak woodlands respond to the openness in landscape structure of tree habitats. We sampled 32 sites in a split-plot design in Krivoklatsko (Czech Republic), which were chosen to include spatial diversity, including dense forests, open forests, woodland edges and solitary trees. A canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) and generalized additive models (GAM) were used for analyses. The results indicated that the taxa studied showed differences in species composition among the studied landscape structures and most taxa preferred more open and light conditions of the woodland environment. We also observed positive effect of the heterogeneity in open landscape structures on biodiversity of saproxylic organisms. As it is recently showed by ecologists, most of the thermophilic oak woodlands are threatened by succession, saproxylic organisms are facing decline throughout the world and traditional forest management (e.g. game keeping, wood pasturing or coppicing) appears to be one solution to mitigate biodiversity loss.},

 abstract = {Studies of the gut microbiome variation among human populations revealed the existence of robust compositional and functional layouts matching the three subsistence strategies that describe a trajectory of changes across our recent evolutionary history: hunting and gathering, rural agriculture, and urban post-industrialized agriculture. In particular, beside the overall reduction of ecosystem diversity, the gut microbiome of Western industrial populations is typically characterized by the loss of Treponema and the acquisition of Bifidobacterium as an abundant inhabitant of the post-weaning gut microbial ecosystem. In order to advance the hypothesis about the possible adaptive nature of this exchange, here we explore specific functional attributes that correspond to the mutually exclusive presence of Treponema and Bifidobacterium using publically available gut metagenomic data from Hadza hunter-gatherers and urban industrial Italians. According to our findings, Bifidobacterium provides the enteric ecosystem with a diverse panel of saccharolytic functions, well suited to the array of gluco- and galacto-based saccharides that abound in the Western diet. On the other hand, the metagenomic functions assigned to Treponema are more predictive of a capacity to incorporate complex polysaccharides, such as those found in unrefined plant foods, which are consistently incorporated in the Hadza diet. Finally, unlike Treponema, the Bifidobacterium metagenome functions include genes that permit the establishment of microbe-host immunological cross-talk, suggesting recent co-evolutionary events between the human immune system and Bifidobacterium that are adaptive in the context of agricultural subsistence and sedentary societies. },

 abstract = {Interdisciplinary research has benefitted the fields of anthropology and engineering for decades: a classic example being the application of material science to the field of feeding biomechanics. However, after decades of research, discordances have developed in how mechanical properties are defined, measured, calculated, and used due to disharmonies between and within fields. This is highlighted by "toughness," or energy release rate, the comparison of incomparable tests (i.e., the scissors and wedge tests), and the comparison of incomparable metrics (i.e., the stress and displacement-limited indices). Furthermore, while material scientists report on a myriad of mechanical properties, it is common for feeding biomechanics studies to report on just one (energy release rate) or two (energy release rate and Young's modulus), which may or may not be the most appropriate for understanding feeding mechanics. Here, I review portions of materials science important to feeding biomechanists, discussing some of the basic assumptions, tests, and measurements. Next, I provide an overview of what is mechanically important during feeding, and discuss the application of mechanical property tests to feeding biomechanics. I also explain how 1) toughness measures gathered with the scissors, wedge, razor, and/or punch and die tests on non-linearly elastic brittle materials are not mechanical properties, 2) scissors and wedge tests are not comparable and 3) the stress and displacement-limited indices are not comparable. Finally, I discuss what data gathered thus far can be best used for, and discuss the future of the field, urging researchers to challenge underlying assumptions in currently used methods to gain a better understanding between primate masticatory morphology and diet.},

The case is made for a degree of standardization to be incorporated into the recording of butchery data and for the integration of evidence from the analysis of cut marks and tool signatures. While the call for standardization is not without precedent the process would benefit from a suitable model: one is proposed herein based in large part on experimental replication and personal vocational experience gained in the modern butchery trade.

The middle-range theory attempts to filter out false conclusions. Abiotic factors have had a strong influence on adaptive evolution; volcanism, tectonism, and climate are exemplified. Subsequently we discuss the biotic viewpoint with regard to aspects of fossil findings and in this context taphonomy, stratigraphic research, and interactions between floral and faunal environment. In a synthesis, we present three cross sections in human evolution in different time horizons (early–middle–late) to exemplify the multidisciplinarity of paleoecology and present some key events that probably altered the direction of radiations among hominids. Obviously, human evolution is not a special kind of evolution; it follows strictly the rules of evolutionary biology and hence depends undoubtedly on environmental influences.},

 abstract = {We present a cross-cultural analysis showing that the presence of an active or moral High God in societies varies generally along a continuum from lesser to greater technological complexity and subsistence productivity. Foragers are least likely to have High Gods. Horticulturalists and agriculturalists are more likely. Pastoralists are most likely, though they are less easily positioned along the productivity continuum. We suggest that belief in moral High Gods was fostered by emerging leaders in societies dependent on resources that were difficult to manage and defend without group cooperation. These leaders used the concept of a supernatural moral enforcer to manipulate others into cooperating, which resulted in greater productivity. Reproductive success would accrue most to such leaders, but the average reproductive success of all individuals in the society would also increase with greater productivity. Supernatural enforcement of moral codes maintained social cohesion and allowed for further population growth, giving one society an advantage in competition with others.},

The evidence for the first stage is largely linguistic and is likely to remain so. The outlines of the fourth stage can be established very largely from traditional evidence. It is for chronological data concerning the second and third stages that we can now turn hopefully to archaeology. In both these stages the Bantu expansion seems to have coincided fairly closely with the spread of the Iron Age; and, if the spread of the Iron Age through the area north of the southern woodlands can now be traced in something like the detail which we already have for Zambia and Rhodesia, the mystery of the Bantu expansion will have been largely unravelled.},

                    Between the ninth and third millennia B.C. wetter conditions prevailed over most of Africa. Lakes and rivers were fuller and some of the internal basins were temporarily linked, especially in the ‘Middle African’ belt. This comprises the southern Sahara and Sahel, stretching from the Upper Niger to the Middle Nile, with a south-easterly extension into the Upper Nile basin and the East African rift valleys. This situation was exploited by people who developed a decidedly aquatic economy and culture. From their waterside camps and settlements archaeologists have recovered bones of fish and aquatic animals which these people ate, as well as the distinctive harpoon-heads carved from bone with which they obtained them, and also pottery, bearing peculiar decoration executed with fish-bones and water-shells, made in imitation of (fishing-) baskets. Boating and other cultural developments are deducible. The harpoons date back to 7,000
                    b.c.
                    at least; the pottery dates back to more than 6,000
                    b.c.
                    and was clearly an African invention. It reflects important developments in gastronomy and home life.
                  
                  In the Kenya rift valley the main stage of Leakey's ‘Kenya Capsian’ culture is essentially the local manifestation of this far-flung ‘aquatic civilization’.
                  
                    Its greatest extent was achieved during the wettest times of the seventh millennium
                    b.c.
                    , and probably involved the expansion of Negroid peoples across this continent-wide savanna belt. Also explained perhaps is the extensive, though now fragmented, distribution of languages which Greenberg combines in his ‘Nilo-Saharan’ super-family. It is suspected that aspects of this ancient aquatic way of life may be maintained or reflected by latter-day isolated or ‘unclean’ lake or swamp communities. This subject has been largely neglected by African culture-historians.
                  
                  
                    Drier conditions in the late sixth and fifth millennia
                    b.c.
                    signalled a decline of this aquatic civilization and, in particular, broke its geographical continuity. Nevertheless, there was a qualified revival in many parts in the fourth and third millennia. In the Kenya rift this later phase seems to equate with the first stage of the ‘stone bowl cultures’. Around Lake Victoria a devolved relic survived until the eve of Bantu expansion about two thousand years ago. Other late or modified examples are known on the Nile and in the western Sudan. Generally, however, the viability and prestige of an aquatic way of life were undermined by the second millennium
                    b.c.
                    In the Sahara and Sahel as well as in the northerly parts of eastern Africa this decline was paralleled by the spread of pastoralism as a new basis of subsistence and prestige. Those who introduced cattle to Kenya from Ethiopia were Cushitic-speakers maintaining, significantly, a fish-taboo.
                  
                  This subject should prove of considerable historiographical interest. The aquatic way of life flourished through Middle Africa at the very time when grain-agriculture and stock-raising were being pioneered in the Near East; and the slow spread of agriculture in Africa, sometimes considered an indication of ‘backwardness’, may be partly explicable by the very success of the aquatic life and of its distinct cultural tradition which was ascendant for a while across the widest part of the continent.},

                    The article presents a reassessment of the archaeological background for the prehistory of the Bantu movements. The differences between the Channelled wares of Central Africa and the Dimple-based wares of East Africa are demonstrated and the greater abundance of Dimple-based ware sites noted. In both cases the distribution is largely in areas suitable for primary cultivation such as river valleys and lakeside areas. It is suggested that both wares are derived from pottery traditions originating to the west of their eastern African distribution areas. Recent evidence would indicate that iron working spread to sub-Saharan Africa both from West Africa and also, via the East African coast, from the Red Sea, and that the earliest iron-using peoples in southern Africa were probably not all negroes. It is also suggested that a negro foraging population was perhaps present in Central Africa before the arrival of agriculture. On agricultural origins, it is noted that some agriculture existed in the Rift valley area by perhaps as early as 1000
                    b.c.
                    , though the main expansion of agriculture is postulated as being of western origin. In conclusion it would appear that the West African origins of Bantu genesis are more important than suggested by Oliver in

                    After the end of the Pleistocene, sub-Saharan Africa seems to have been more receptive of than contributory to cultural progress in the Old World as a whole. By that time favourable localities in the subcontinent—the margins of lakes and watercourses, the sea coasts, the peripheral regions of the equatorial forest—were sometimes supporting nearly, or entirely, sedentary communities of hunting-collecting peoples who were enabled to live in this way due to the permanent presence of one or more staple sources of food: freshwater fish, water animals and plants, and sea foods; and forest foods (the
                    Dioscoreas, Elaeis guineensis
                    , and other oil-bearing plants), either perennial or capable of being stored. Evidence of such occupation is seen in the midden accumulations in both cave and open sites at this time. Populations could thus become more concentrated and an increase in density may be inferred, the limiting factor being the maximum that any one environment could support by intensified collecting methods (fig. I).

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Primate social systems are remarkably diverse, and thus play a central role in understanding social evolution, including the biological origin of human societies. Although baboons have been prominently featured in this context, historically little was known about the westernmost member of the genus, the Guinea baboon (Papio papio).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we summarize the findings from the first years of observations at the field site CRP Simenti in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal.
RESULTS: Guinea baboons reveal a nested multi-level social organization, with reproductive units comprising one "primary" male, one to several females, young, and occasionally "secondary" males at the base of the society. Three to five units form "parties," which team up with other parties to form a "gang." Different gangs have largely overlapping home ranges and agonistic interactions between different parties or gangs are rare. Some but not all strongly socially bonded males are highly related, and population genetic and behavioral evidence indicate female-biased dispersal. Females play an important role in intersexual bond formation and maintenance, and female tenure length varies between a few weeks to several years.
DISCUSSION: While the social organization resembles that of hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas), the social structure differs considerably, specifically in terms of low male aggressiveness and female freedom. Despite substantial differences in social organization and social structure, the acoustic structure of Guinea baboon vocalizations does not differ substantially from that of other baboon taxa. With its multi-level organization, stable bonds between males and females, as well as a high-degree of male-male cooperation and tolerance, Guinea baboons constitute an intriguing model for reconstructing human social evolution.},

Hildebrandt and Jones (1992) recently suggested that prehistoric exploitation of seals and sea lions along the coast of California and Oregon resulted in the destruction of all mainland rookeries for some species and a concomitant shift in subsistence pursuits to focus on other marine mammal taxa. Statistical analyses of available zooarchaeological data indicate those data do not completely support their contention. Some of the samples display the hypothesized pattern of changes in taxonomic abundances, but some do not. Two sites on the Oregon coast suggest some rookeries may have existed on or very near the mainland into the historic period.},

 abstract = { Hunter–gatherer adaptations to moist tropical grasslands are not well known from either the ethnographic or the archaeological record. This is unfortunate as grassland adaptations are clearly significant to human biological and behavioral evolution. The most effective strategy for remedying this problem is to develop models for grassland exploitation based on strong understandings of the ecological similarities and differences between cold, temperate, and tropical grasslands. Cold, temperate, and tropical grasslands are similar in that water and raw materials are often scarce and the most abundant large mammals are gregarious and mobile. Tropical grasslands differ from cold and temperate grasslands by having a greater diversity and biomass of edible above-ground plants and plants with underground storage organs, making carbohydrate availability greater and less seasonal. Large mobile mammals and resident large mammals are more diverse and have greater biomass in tropical grasslands. Overall, tropical grasslands are a richer and less seasonally punctuated environment than either cold or temperate grasslands. A comparison of ethnographic data regarding variation in foraging strategies in different cold, temperate, and tropical settings lead to the construction of three models for hunter–gatherer exploitation of tropical grasslands: a Generalized Grassland Model (no specialized tactical hunting—considered the favored model given modern African grassland conditions), a Seasonal Grassland Model (only seasonal use of specialized tactical hunting techniques—considered unlikely for Africa), and a Specialized Grassland Model (regular use of specialized tactical hunting strategies—considered highly unlikely for Africa). A preliminary test of these models shows the Athi-Kapiti Plains Holocene archaeological evidence is most consistent with the Generalized Grassland Model. The Last Glacial Maximum is most consistent with the Seasonal Grassland Model. A single MSA occupation also suggests that specialized tactical hunting strategies were used. These differences in hunting strategies were probably due to the differences in ecological conditions between the Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum.},

 abstract = { Coevolution is defined as reciprocal selective pressures that operate to make the evolution of one taxon partially dependent on the evolution another. This process often involves multiple species exploiting shared limiting resources. In classic coevolutionary models, populations of sympatric species are seen to diverge in one or more morphological, ecological, or behavioral traits to effect more even partitioning of resources and reduce levels of interspecific competition. Character displacement and resource partitioning are thought to be central not only to how species coexist on limited resources, but also to how species invade new resource niches. Hominid invasion of the predatory guild at least 2 my ago would have brought them into contact with a range of new selective pressures including competition with a number of large-bodied predators. This study explores resource partitioning between hominids and other Plio-Pleistocene large-bodied predators through analyses of predator food transport strategies. The anatomical content (head/limb MNE) of hominid transported faunal assemblages at Bed I Olduvai and FxJj 50 (Koobi Fora), when compared to modern predator control cases, suggests that Plio-Pleistocene hominids practiced food transport strategies intermediate between those of top predators such as wolves and those of confrontational scavengers such as spotted hyaenas. Plio-Pleistocene hominid food transport strategies do not resemble those of nonconfrontational scavengers such as brown and striped hyenas. The highly regular patterns differentiating bone assemblages accumulated by top predators, hominids, and confrontational and nonconfrontational scavengers suggest that hominid invasion of the predatory guild involved resource partitioning potentially based on some form of character displacement.},

However, recent theoretical and ethnoarchaeological research is divided over the types of bone assemblages that have the best potential for accurately reflecting transport and discard patterns. This paper quantitatively evaluates the usefulness of skeletal part profiles as evidence of differential transport from ethnoarchaeological Hadza bone assemblages. Skeletal part abundances from different types of Hadza sites (butchering sites, a hunting blind, and a residential base) are compared to previously reported observations of body part transport/discard decisions (O'Connell et al. 1988, 1990). Analysis of these assemblages suggests that observed Hadza transport/discard decisions are more accurately reflected by small-scale, single-event butchering stands. Larger-sized bone assemblages representing amalgamations of many butchering events poorly reflect observed transport and discard patterns. The results of this analysis show that under circumstances where prey are singly acquired, small sites may reveal a far more accurate picture of prehistoric body-part transport patterns than large and highly visible archaeological sites.},

Binford's Grease Index is reviewed and found to be a questionable measure of bone fat. Results of this study and those of Emerson are generally complementary. Carnivore selection of bones correlates strongly with grease content (r=0·954). Differential yield of grease may help account for patterns of faunal abundance at certain bison kill sites. Bone grease is a minor but dependable and nutritious fat supply that may have been especially important during time of stress. As the last and the most destructive of butchering events, bone grease rendering has the potential to exert great influence over patterns of skeletal abundance.},

Though potential mechanisms have been suggested, there is an alternative: much “altruistic” behavior may in fact be purely selfish in origin and consequently reciprocity need not be invoked to provide a selective benefit to the actor. Sharing and helping are fundamentally different behavior categories and should not be confused. Patterns of resource sharing in chimpanzees correspond to predictions made by a selfish model but not to those of a reciprocal altruism model, and many observations of human gift exchange are consistent with the selfish, but not the altruistic, model. This suggests that presumed hominid meat exchange may have been the result of competition, not altruism or even cooperation, and that evolutionary models of “altruistic” behavior should be treated with caution.},

 abstract = {Japanese archaeology benefits from the large number of rescue excavations conducted during recent decades that have led to an unparalleled record of archaeological sites. That record is here put to use to interrogate changing settlement patterns in the north-eastern corner of Tokyo Bay during several millennia of the Jomon period (Early, Middle and Late Jomon: 7000–3220 cal BP). Jomon hunter-gatherer occupation is characterised by large numbers of settlements, some of them substantial in size, containing hundreds of individual pit-house residential units. Detailed analysis of the rank-size distribution of these settlements reveals a pattern in which periods of settlement clumping, with few large settlements, alternate with more dispersed settlement patterns on a regular cycle of approximately 600 years. The regularity of this cycle might suggest a correlation with cycles of climatic change, such as Bond events. Closer scrutiny shows, however, that such a correlation is unconvincing and suggests that cyclical change in Jomon settlement patterns may instead be due to other factors.},

 abstract = { ABSTRACT: In this paper, I distinguish between two families of theories which view moral norms as either “inputs” or “outputs.” I argue that the most plausible version of each model can ultimately be seen as the two sides of the same model, which I call Moderate Nativism. The difference between these two apparently antagonistic models is one of perspective rather than content: while the Input model explains how emotional dispositions constrain the historical evolution of moral norms, the Output model explains how these same dispositions naturally give rise to corresponding moral judgments in individuals. 
 RÉSUMÉ: Dans cet article, je distingue deux familles théoriques qui conçoivent les normes morales comme des «intrants» (inputs) ou des «extrants» (outputs). Je soutiens que l’on peut ultimement unifier la meilleure version de ces deux modèles en un seul modèle théorique que je nomme l’Innéisme Modéré. La différence entre ces deux modèles apparemment antagonistes en est une de perspective plutôt que de contenu : alors que le modèle des intrants analyse l’impact de dispositions émotionnelles sur l’évolution historique des normes morales, le modèle des extrants s’intéresse plutôt au rôle de ces mêmes dispositions dans le développement de jugements moraux individuels. },

 abstract = {
                    This paper describes the consonant inventory of the endangered southern African language Nǀuu. Our novel approach to segment classification accounts for all 73 Nǀuu consonants with just four phonetic dimensions (place, manner, phonation, airstream) and does away with the phonetically empty category
                    click accompaniment
                    . We provide ultrasound data showing that the posterior constrictions in clicks are not produced at the ‘velar’ place of articulation, and that posterior place differs with anterior place. We therefore argue for a terminological shift from
                    velaric
                    to
                    lingual
                    airstream mechanism. Our data also show that the posterior place of articulation is the same in Nǀuu's five lingual ([⊙ ǀ ǃ ǁ ǂ]) and linguo-pulmonic ([
                    
                      
                    
                    ]) stops. We argue that the difference between these segment classes is best captured in terms of airstream, not place. Plain clicks use only the lingual airstream, while linguo-pulmonic segments are airstream contours, in which the transition to the pulmonic airstream occurs within the segment rather than at its boundary. Our evidence suggests that the contrast between ‘velar’ and ‘uvular’ clicks proposed for the related language ǃXóõ is likely also one of airstream and that a contrast solely in terms of posterior place would be articulatorily impossible.

@article{pub.1054864194,
 abstract = {The Cuddie Springs site in south-eastern Australia provides the first evidence of an unequivocal association of megafauna with humans for this continent. Cuddie Springs has been known as a fossil megafauna locality for over a century, but its archaeological record has only recently been identified. Cuddie Springs is an open site, with the fossil deposits preserved in a claypan on the floor of an ancient ephemeral lake. Investigations revealed a stratified deposit of human occupation and fossil megafauna, suggesting a temporal overlap and an active association of megafauna with people in the lead up to the Last Glacial Maximum, when conditions were more arid than the present day. Two distinct occupation phases have been identified and are correlated to the hydrology of the Cuddie Springs lake. When people first arrived at Cuddie Springs, sometime before 30,000 BP, the claypan on the lake floor was similar to a waterhole, with five species of megafauna identified. Flaked stone artefacts were found scattered through this level. After the lake dried, there was human occupation of the claypan. The resource base broadened to include a range of plant foods. Megafauna appear to be just one of a range of food resources exploited during this period. A return to ephemeral conditions resulted in only periodic occupation of the site with megafauna disappearing from the record around 28,000 BP. The timing of overlap and association of megafauna with human occupation is coincident with the earliest occupation sites in this region. The archaeological evidence from Cuddie Springs suggests an opportunistic exploitation of resources and no specialised strategies for hunting megafauna. Disappearance of megafauna is likely to be a consequence of climatic change during the lead up to the Last Glacial Maximum and human activities may have compounded an extinction process well under way.
Résumé Le site de Cuddie Springs en Australie du sud-est fournit la première preuve d'association sans équivoque entre la mégafaune et l’homme sur ce continent. On connaît Cuddie Springs en tant que lieu de découverte de fossiles de mégafaune depuis plus d'un siècle, mais ce n'est que récemment qu'on a reconnu sa richesse archéologique. Cuddie Springs est un site découvert avec des dépôts de fossiles préservés dans une cuvette argileuse sur le fond d'un ancien lac éphémère. Les recherches ont révélé des vestiges stratifiés d'occupation humaine et de mégafaune fossilisée, donnant à croire à une concomittance et à une réelle association de la mégafaune et des hommes au cours de la période qui a précédé le denier grand maximum glaciaire, quand les conditions étaient plus arides qu'elles ne le sont actuellement. On a identifié deux phases d'occupation distinctes qui sont en corrélation avec l'hydrologie du lac de Cuddie Springs. Quand les hommes sont arrivés pour la première fois à Cuddie Springs, avant 30,000 ans avant le présent, la cuvette argileuse au fond du lac ressemblait à un trou d'eau, cinq espèces de mégafaune y ont été identifiées. Des objets de pierre sur éclats ont été trouvés éparpillés partout à ce niveau. Après l'assèchement du lac, la cuvette argileuse fut occupée par l'homme. La gamme de ressources s’élargit pour inclure alors une variété de plantes comestibles. La mégafaune semble n’avoir représenté qu'une variété de nourriture parmi d'autres exploitées pendant cette période. Un retour à des conditions éphémères a eu comme résultat l'occupation périodique seulement du site, la mégafaune disparaissant des témoignages vers 28,000 avant le présent. La période pendant laquelle la mégafaune et l'ocupation humaine se sont chevauchées et associées coincide avec les sites d'occupation les plus anciens de la région. Les témoignages archéologiques de Cuddie Springs mettent en évidence une exploitation opportuniste des ressources et ne prouvent pas l'existence de stratégie particulière pour chasser la mégafaune. Il est probable que la disparition de la mégafaune ait été la conséquence d'un changement climatique pendant la période qui a précédé le dernier maximum glaciaire et les activités humaines ont peut-être contribué à un procédé d'extinction déjà bien engagé.
Zusammenfassung Die Cuddie Springs Fundstelle in Südost-Australien liefert den ersten Nachweis einer unzweideutigen Assoziation von Großfauna und Menschen für diesen Kontinent. Cuddie Springs war für über ein Jahrhundert als Fundstelle fossiler Großfauna bekannr, doch seine archäologischen Funde sind erst kürzlich identifiziert worden. Cuddie Springs ist eine offene Fundstelle, in der die fossilen Ablagerungen in einer Lehmpfanne auf dem Boden eines alten kurzlebigen Sees erhalten geblieben waren. Untersuchungen haben eine srratifizierte Ablagerung menschlicher Nutzung und fossiler Großfauna gezeigt, die eine temporäre Überlappung und eine aktive Verbindung von Großfauna und Menschen am letzten Glazialmaximum – einer Zeit als die Verhältnisse trockener waren als heute – nahelegt. Zwei unterschiedliche Nutzungsphasen konnten erkannt werden und sind mit dem Wasserhaushalt des Cuddie Springs Sees korreliert worden. Als die Menschen das erste Mal nach Cuddie Springs kamen, irgendwann vor 30,000 BP, konnten in der Lehmpfanne auf dem Grund des Sees, der einem Wasserloch ähnelte, fünf Spezies von Großfauna identifiziert werden. Abschläge von Steinartefakten wurden verstreut in diesem Niveau gefunden. Nachdem der See ausgetrocknet war, wurde die Lehmpfanne von Menschen genutzt. Die Nahrungsgrundlage wurde erweitert, indem verschiedene Pflanzen mit einbezogen wurden. Großfauna scheint dabei nur ein Bestandteil der Nahrungsressourcen gewesen zu sein, die in dieser Periode verwertet wurden. Eine Rückkehr zu kurzlebigen Verhältnissen resultierte in einer lediglich periodischen Nutzung des Lagerplatzes, und dementsprechend im Verschwinden der Großfauna aus dem Fundzusammenhang um 28,000 BP. Das zeitliche Zusammentreffen von Überlappung und Verknüpfung von Großfauna und menschlicher Nutzung deckt sich mit der frühesten Besiedlung in dieser Region. Der archäologische Nachweis von Cuddie Springs weist auf eine opportunistische Verwertung der Ressourcen hin, und nicht auf spezialisierte Strategien zur Jagd auf Großfauna. Das Verschwinden der Großfauna war wahrscheinlich eine Konsequenz der klimatischen Veränderung während des letzten Glazialmaximum. Aber auch die menschlichen Aktivitäten mögen eine Rolle gespielt haben in diesem sich bereits auf dem Weg befindlichen Prozess des Aussterbens der Großfauna.
Résumen El yacimiento arqueológico de Cuddie Springs, en Australia sur-oriental, ha proporcionado evidencia de una relación inequívoca entre megafauna y seres humanos en este continente. Que Cuddie Springs era una mina de fósiles es bien sabido desde el siglo pasado, pero sólo recientemente se ha identificado su registro arqueológico. Cuddie Springs es un yacimiento abierto, donde los depósitos fósiles están preservados en una capa de arcilla, en lo que fué el suelo de un antiguo y efímero lago. La investigación ha revelado un depósito estratificado de ocupación humana y de megafauna, que sugiere que los dos coincidieron parcialmente en el tiempo y que se puede hablar de una asociación activa entre megafauna y seres humanos en los momentos previos al último Máximo Glacial, cuando las condiciones del medio ambiente eran más áridas que en el presente. Se pueden distinguir dos fase de ocupación bien diferenciadas y correlacionadas con la hidrología del lago de Cuddie Springs. Cuando los hombres llegaron por primera vez a Cuddie Springs, en un momento anterior al año 30,000 BP, la capa de arcilla en el suelo del lago era similar a un abrevadero, con cinco especies de megafauna identificadas. Útiles de piedra tallada se encontraron diseminados por todo este nivel. Después de que se secó el lago, la ocupación humana apareció en el suelo de arcilla. Se amplió la base de recursos incluyendo una serie de alimentos vegetales. La megafauna parece ser simplemente uno más entre los recursos alimenticios explotados durante este periodo. Un retorno a las breves condiciones medio¬ambientales previas resultó en la ocupación del yacimiento de manera sólo periódica, mientras que la megafauna desaparece totalmente del regisrro alrededor del año 28,000 BP. El momento de la coincidencia temporal y de la asociación entre megafauna y ocupación humana coincide con la ocupación más temprana de yacimientos en esta región. La evidencia arqueológica de Cuddie Springs sugiere una explotación oportunística de los recursos y estrategias no especializadas en la caza de megafauna. La desaparición de la megafauna es probablemente una consecuencia de los cambios climatológicos durante el periodo previo al último Máximo Glacial, y la actividad humana puede haber contribuido a un proceso de extinción ya bien avanzado.},

This induces deficiency symptoms, diseases and results in lower energy yields from food. It might also result in the loss of intestinal mucous and "leaky gut". Inflammation then contributes to dyslipidemia and obesity. The diversity of microbial species is transmitted to the offspring.

 abstract = {This paper presents; an experimental examination of the potential function of Early Stone Age (ESA) stone tool technology. The discussion situates the behavior associated with ESA technology within the context of evidence for subsistence activities from faunal remains. On the basis of this experiment, I argue that: (I) many tasks associated with carcass processing in situations of secondary carcass access could have been carried out with equal efficiency with unmodified cobbles rather than modified stone tools; (2) core tools offer no major advantages over unmodified cobbles in bone breaking; and (3) flakes are generally more effective than core tools in cutting tasks such as defleshing and joint disarticulation. Therefore, I argue that defleshing and joint disarticulation were the primary uses of stone tool technology within the context off carcass processing I also propose that a great deal of early hominid carcass processing was done without modified stone tools, leaving neither lithic nor faunal evidence of these activities. Stone tools may have been infrequently required for regular subsistence activities, but they take on such importance because of their visibility relative to other remains. Finally, the paper suggests that stone tool manufacture may have emerged from a pattern of marginal scavenging that required no stone tool manufacture and left no archaeological evidence.},

Unfortunately, constraints of time and moneyfor most archaeological research projects do not typically permit time-consuming analyses such as lithic refitting, at least as it has been practiced in some of the best-known case studies, such as thePincevent site, in France (Leroi-Gourhan and Brézillon 1966; Leroi-Gourhan 1984; Pelegrin 1985, 1986; Bodu et al. 1990). This paper presents a case studyfrom the Big Eddy site in Southwest Missouri that offers insight into how we can work within budgetary and temporal constraints to produce acceptable and useful data by refitting materials for which less fine-grained spatial data are available. In this case, refit analysis of materials recoveredfrom general midden contexts within 5- and 10-cm excavation levels and from 16 lithic knapping features allowed for an assessment of the degree of integrity of the site's deposits and the spatial organization of activities performed by the site's various Paleoindian occupants.},

 abstract = {Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mutations that result in reduced enzyme activity have been implicated in malarial resistance and constitute one of the best examples of selection in the human genome. In the present study, we characterize the nucleotide diversity across a 5.2-kb region of G6PD in a sample of 160 Africans and 56 non-Africans, to determine how selection has shaped patterns of DNA variation at this gene. Our global sample of enzymatically normal B alleles and A, A-, and Med alleles with reduced enzyme activities reveals many previously uncharacterized silent-site polymorphisms. In comparison with the absence of amino acid divergence between human and chimpanzee G6PD sequences, we find that the number of G6PD amino acid polymorphisms in human populations is significantly high. Unlike many other G6PD-activity alleles with reduced activity, we find that the age of the A variant, which is common in Africa, may not be consistent with the recent emergence of severe malaria and therefore may have originally had a historically different adaptive function. Overall, our observations strongly support previous genotype-phenotype association studies that proposed that balancing selection maintains G6PD deficiencies within human populations. The present study demonstrates that nucleotide sequence analyses can reveal signatures of both historical and recent selection in the genome and may elucidate the impact that infectious disease has had during human evolution.},

Although color vision genes have been the targets of active molecular and psychophysical research on color vision abnormalities, little is known about patterns of normal genetic variation in these genes among global human populations. The current study presents nucleotide sequence analyses and tests of neutrality for a 5.5-kb region of the X-linked long-wave "red" opsin gene (OPN1LW) in 236 individuals from ethnically diverse human populations. Our analysis of the recombination landscape across OPN1LW reveals an unusual haplotype structure associated with amino acid replacement variation in exon 3 that is consistent with gene conversion. Compared with the absence of OPN1LW amino acid replacement fixation since divergence from chimpanzee, the human population exhibits a significant excess of high-frequency OPN1LW replacements. Our results suggest that subtle changes in L-cone opsin wavelength absorption may have been adaptive during human evolution.},

In the present study, we employed an evolutionary approach to understand environmental attitudes. Specifically, we examined the role of status striving and hypercompetitiveness as they related to overconsumption and climate change attitudes. A mixed student/community sample (Mean age = 33.6) completed measures relating to hypercompetitiveness, insecure status striving, overconsumption of resources, and attitudes toward climate change. Participants endorsed the role of human activity in climate change to a similar level as national polls. Both insecure status striving and hypercompetitiveness were significantly related to a feeling that one deserves material possessions and pessimism about remedying climate change. Hypercompetitiveness was further related to self-reports of having more material possessions than are regularly used. Regression analyses revealed that hypercompetitiveness mediated the relationship between insecure status striving and scores on relevant overconsumption and climate change items. Therefore, hypercompetitiveness may be the underlying mechanism by which status striving is related to overconsumption and pessimism about ameliorating climate change. We discuss the implications of the findings and how an evolutionary approach can be used to further inform climate change research and efforts to “go green.” Key Words: Status striving—Hypercompetitive—Overconsumption—Climate change.},

We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model in which a population's long-run steady-state level of inequality depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute to this pattern.},

The relation which exists between disease, social behavior, and human adaptation constitutes the primary subject matter of ethnomedicine. This relation is examined in terms of man's unique capacities for symbolization and culture. Since ethnomedical generalizations explain how social groups deal with a generic disease, they can be used to examine contemporary problems which involve the organization and practice of medicine as well as problems that stem from relations of the medical system with other subsystems in the group. Recasting contemporary social problems in this way may help to clarify their roots and sources (13,28). In focusing on fundamental properties of disease in man, ethnomedicine  can also help to clarify the effects and meanings of disease and thereby make its control more rational.

 abstract = { How did cooperation evolve when cheaters—those who benefit without making sacrifices—can threaten its stability? In the ninth essay in Science 's series in honor of the Year of Darwin, Elizabeth Pennisi discusses the genetic nuts and bolts of cooperation in systems from microbes to humans. 
 In the ninth essay in Science 's series in honor of the Year of Darwin, Elizabeth Pennisi explores why an individual would help another at a cost to itself when natural selection favors the survival of the fittest. Charles Darwin suggested that selection might favor families whose members were cooperative, and researchers today agree that kinship helps explain cooperation. But cheaters—those who benefit without making sacrifices—are likely to evolve because they will have an edge over individuals who spend energy on helping others, thus threatening the stability of any cooperative venture. That puzzle has inspired biologists, mathematicians, even economists to come up with ways to explain how cooperation can arise and thrive. Researchers have spent countless hours observing social organisms from man to microbes, finding that even single-celled organisms have sophisticated means of working together. As genomics has come of age, researchers are getting down to the genetic nuts and bolts of cooperation in a variety of systems for the first time. },

Two billion years ago, an early cell swallowed an energy-producing microbe, giving birth to the mitochondria that are the hallmarks of all eukaryotes. Evolutionary biologists now think that was just the start of the influence that the cell's "powerhouses" have on the tree of life. Mitochondria, which can exist by the scores in a eukaryotic cell, have their own set of genes, which can replicate and mutate faster than the cell's better-known complement in the nucleus. Yet both genomes code for products that have to work together in the mitochondria. Researchers are now finding hints that cells' efforts to keep nuclear and mitochondrial genes in sync could play a major role in evolution. At a recent meeting, biologists suggested out-of-sync nuclear and mitochondrial genomes may explain many biological puzzles—from why some female birds prefer the reddest mates to the evolution of new species in both plants and animals.},

Of all relationships between wild animals and people, few are more heartwarming than that of African honey hunters and a robin-sized bird called the greater honeyguide. Flitting and calling, the bird leads the way to a bee's nest and feasts on the wax after the honey hunters have raided it. Researchers have discovered that this mutualistic relationship is even tighter than it seemed, with the bird recognizing and responding to specific calls from its human partners. In the new work, the researchers quantify the benefit to people helped by the birds and test how much more guiding occurs when the honey hunters attract the birds first with a "trill-grunt" call. This work was done in Mozambique, but it seems honey hunters elsewhere also have special calls, albeit different ones.},

 abstract = {Diet is a major determinant of community composition in the human gut microbiome, and "traditional" diets have been associated with distinct and highly diverse communities, compared to Western diets. However, most traditional diets studied have been those of agrarians and hunter-gatherers consuming fiber-rich diets. In contrast, the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic have been consuming a traditional diet low in carbohydrates and rich in animal fats and protein for thousands of years. We hypothesized that the Inuit diet and lifestyle would be associated with a distinct microbiome. We used deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to compare the gut microbiomes of Montrealers with a Western diet to those of the Inuit consuming a range of traditional and Western diets. At the overall microbial community level, the gut microbiomes of Montrealers and Inuit were indistinguishable and contained similar levels of microbial diversity. However, we observed significant differences in the relative abundances of certain microbial taxa down to the subgenus level using oligotyping. For example, <i>Prevotella</i> spp., which have been previously associated with high-fiber diets, were enriched in Montrealers and among the Inuit consuming a Western diet. The gut microbiomes of Inuit consuming a traditional diet also had significantly less genetic diversity within the <i>Prevotella</i> genus, suggesting that a low-fiber diet might not only select against <i>Prevotella</i> but also reduce its diversity. Other microbes, such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, were associated with geography as well as diet, suggesting limited dispersal to the Arctic. Our report provides a snapshot of the Inuit microbiome as Western-like in overall community structure but distinct in the relative abundances and diversity of certain genera and strains. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Non-Western populations have been shown to have distinct gut microbial communities shaped by traditional diets. The hitherto-uncharacterized microbiome of the Inuit may help us to better understand health risks specific to this population such as diabetes and obesity, which increase in prevalence as many Inuit transition to a Western diet. Here we show that even Inuit consuming a mostly traditional diet have a broadly Western-like microbiome. This suggests that similarities between the Inuit diet and the Western diet (low fiber, high fat) may lead to a convergence of community structures and diversity. However, certain species and strains of microbes have significantly different levels of abundance and diversity in the Inuit, possibly driven by differences in diet. Furthermore, the Inuit diet provides an exception to the correlation between traditional diets and high microbial diversity, potentially due to their transitioning diet. Knowledge of the Inuit microbiome may provide future resources for interventions and conservation of Inuit heritage.},

Based on anthropological findings, we develop a theory about how the communal-sharing norm emerges and is maintained. Then, using evolutionary computer simulations, we test several hypotheses about the conditions under which the norm will dominate social resource sharing. We further test behavioral implications of the norm, demonstrating that uncertainty involved in resource acquisition is a key factor that triggers the psychology of sharing even in highly industrialized societies. Finally, we discuss the importance of norm construct for analyzing the dynamic relation between minds and society.},

 abstract = {This article explains the naẓm (structure) position as one of the main aspects of miracles of al-Qur’ān. It explains that although al-Qur’ānis in Arabic, but it does not use the form and composition of models that have been used by the Arabs in their works. Al-Qur’ān performs in different way, not in the form of poetry, rhyme, letter or speech, but in kalām (theword). The article then explains that the way to make sense of this kalām was used as a pioneering theory by ‘Abd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī. This theory is then used and applied by al-Alūsī in his commentary book, Rūḥ al-Ma‘ānī. This study shows the importance of the naẓm of al-Qur’ān, in which it becomes specific guidelines for researcher to understand the message of the Qur’ān. Keywords: Qur’ānic miracles, naẓm , al-Alūsī.

 abstract = {Within the broad framework of historical and behavioral ecology, we analyzed faunal remains from a large habitation site (CA-SRI-147) on Santa Rosa Island to explore a 7,000 year record of coastal subsistence, nearshore ecological dynamics, and human impacts on shellfish populations. This long, stratified sequence provides a rare opportunity to study the effects of prolonged human predation on local intertidal and nearshore habitats. During the past 7,000 years, the Island Chumash and their predecessors had significant impacts on nearshore ecosystems, caused by growing human populations and depletion of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. At CA-SRI-147, local depletion of higher ranked shellfish species stimulated dietary expansion and a heavier reliance on lower-ranked shellfish taxa and more intensive exploitation of nearshore and pelagic fishes. In the Late Holocene, as local ecosystems were increasingly depleted, the Island Chumash relied increasingly on craft specialization and trade to meet their subsistence needs. Native peoples clearly impacted Channel Island ecosystems, but data from CA-SRI-147 suggest that they adjusted their subsistence strategies toward productive fisheries that sustained the high population densities and sociopolitical complexity recorded by early Spanish chroniclers at European contact.
Résumé Dentro de los marcos amplios de la ecología histórica y la ecología del comportamiento, analizamos los restos faunisticos de un sitio habitacional grande (CA-SRI-147) en la Isla Santa Rosa para investigar el historial de 7000 años de subsistencia costera, la dinámica ecológica cercana a la costa, y los impactos humanos sobre poblaciones de mariscos. Esta secuencia larga y estratificada nos provee de la rara oportunidad de estudiar las consecuencias de depredación humana prolongada en hábitats locales litorales y cercanos a la costa. En los últimos 7000 años, la Isla Chumash y sus predecesores tenían un gran impacto sobre los ecosistemas cercanos a la costa, causado por las poblaciones humanas cada vez mayor y el agotamiento de ecosistemas marinos y terrestres. En CA-SRI-147, el agotamiento local de especies de mariscos de alto rango promovió la expansión dietética, más dependencia de los mariscos de taxa de bajo rango, y la explotación más intensiva de los pescados pelágicos y cercanos a la costa. En el Holoceno tardío, cuando los ecosistemas locales fueron agotados cada vez más, la Isla Chumash se basó cada vez más en la especialización artesanal y el comercio para satisfacer sus necesidades de subsistencia. Aunque la población indígena tenía un impacto claro sobre los ecosistemas de las Islas Channel, los datos arqueológicos de CA-SRI-147 dan a entender que ajustaron las estrategias de subsistencias a pesquerías productivas que habrían sostenido las altas densidades demográficas y la complejidad sociopolítica anotado por los cronistas españoles del contacto europeo.},

 abstract = {A faunal assemblage may be dominated by dense bones either because the soft ones have been transported away or because they have been gnawed beyond recognition. Archaeologists have often despaired of distinguishing between these hypotheses and have attributed the problem to equifinality-to the fact that different causes can produce identical outcomes. Yet under the models of transport and attrition studied here, these causes do not produce identical outcomes. It has been difficult to distinguish between them only because conventional statistical methods lack power. Using the new method of abcml (Analysis of Bone Counts by Maximum Likelihood), it is easy to distinguish assemblages that were deposited by different agents. It is also possible to distinguish between assemblages that have suffered differing degrees of attritional damage, but this distinction is more difficult to make. It is also shown that the conventional method for recognizing attritional damage in faunal assemblages is remarkably low in power. The paper closes with a discussion of the word "equifinality" itself.
Resumen
                  Una colección de fauna puede consistir en su mayor parte de huesos densos porque los huesos blandos han sido transportados fuera o porque ellos han sido roídos més allá de reconocimiento. Frecuentemente los arqueólogos se han desesperado por distinguir entre estas hipótesis y han atribuído el problema a equifinalidad, hecho en que causas diferentes pueden producir resultados idénticos. Pero con los modelos de transporte y desgaste estudiados aquí, estas causas no producen resultados idénticos. Ha sido difícil distinguir entre ellos solamente porque los métodos convencionales de estadística no tienen suficientepoder. Usando el método nuevo de abcml (Analysis of Bone Counts by Maximum Likelihood [en español, Análisis de la Cuenta de Huesos por el Mátodo de Probabilidad Máxima]), es fácil de distinguir entre colecciones que estaban depositadas por agentes diferentes. También es posible distinguir entre colecciones que han sufrido niveles diversos de daño de desgaste, pero esta distinción es más difícil de hacer. También se ha demostrado que el método convencional para el reconocimiento de daño de desgaste en colecciones de fauna es notablemente débil en poder.

 abstract = {Research on the Folsom Paleoindian type site, involving renewed field investigations and an analysis of extant collections from the 1920s excavations, was undertaken between 1997 and 2000. The preliminary results of that research show that all excavations to date have been in the kill area, which took place in a small and relatively shallow tributary to the Pleistocene paleovalley of Wild Horse Arroyo as well as in the paleovalley itself. Preliminary butchering of ∼32 Bison antiquus took place near where the animals were dropped. The kill area is dominated by low-utility bone elements and broken projectile points; high-utility bones and tools for processing meat and hides are rare or absent, and either occur in another, as-yet undiscovered area of the site, or altogether off-site. Faunal remains are generally in excellent condition. Those in the tributary are mostly in primary context, and underwent rapid burial beneath fine-grained (dominantly aeolian) sediments, which in turn were subsequently armored by a shingle shale; those in the paleovalley experienced postdepositional transport and redeposition. The small lithic assemblage is dominated by projectile points and comprised of material mostly from two sources in the Texas panhandle, several hundred kilometers southeast of the site. It also includes stone obtained from sources at comparable distances north and northwest of the site. A series of radiocarbon ages is available for the stratigraphic units, nearly all from charcoal of non-cultural origins; radiocarbon dates on bison bone put the age of the kill at 10,500 B.P.

Los resultados preliminares de esa investigación muestran que todas las excavaciones hasta el presente fueron en el área de matanza, que tuvo lugar en un tributario pequeño y angosto delpaleovalle del Arroyo Wild Horse, así como también en el paleovalle mismo. El descuartizamiento preliminar de aproximadamente 32 Bison antiquus se realizó cerca de donde los animates fueron lanzados. El área de matanza está dominada por elementos de hueso de haja utilidad y de puntas de pwyectil fracturadas, huesos de alta utilidad e instrumentos para procesar came y cueros son escasos o ausentes, es decir que se encuentran en otra area del sitio aún sin descubrir, o fuera del sitio. Los recursos faunísticos están en general en condiciones excelentes, los del arroyo están en gran parte en contexto primario, y fueron cubiertos rápidumente bajo sedimentos de granofino (predominantemente eólicos), los cuales a su vez fueron cubiertos por una gravilla de esquistos; aquellos encontrados en el paleovalle fueron transportados y redepositados. El pequeño conjunto lítico está compuesto predominantemente por puntas de pwyectil, incluye en gran parte materiales de dos recursos localizadas en el extremo oeste de Texas, a varios cientos de kilometros al sudeste del sitio. Tambien incluye piedra adquirida de recursos a cientos de kilómetros al noroeste y al norte del sitio. También incluye piedra adquirida de recursos a cientos de kilómetros al noroeste y al norte del sitio. Se encuentra disponible una serie de fechamientos radiocarbónicos sobre las unidades estratigráficas, prácticamente efectuados todos sobre carbón sin aparente origen cultural, los fechamientos radiocarbónicos sobre hueso de bisonte ubican a la matanza en los 10,500 años a.p.},

Artifacts and coprolite/macrofloral remains from the Clydes Cavern and Hogup Cave Fremont sites suggest that the spread of maize farming coincided with: (a) the development of grass collecting; (bj the expansion of a grassland environment; (c) outside cultural contacts; and (dj genetic modifications in corn. Ethnohistoric evidence indicates that the diffusion ofNuma horticulture in the early historic period also occurred in a context of environmental change. However, unlike the Fremont example in which natural environmental modifications were present, the spread of Numa farming occurred as a result of disruptions to the native plant communities and the seed gathering cycle caused by external cultural pressures. Both examples demonstrate that while the specific reasons for the adoption and growth of farming differed depending upon the regional situation, the overall pattern of horticultural diffusion in the Southwest and Great Basin may have been favored by selective pressures involving environmental alteration, population expansion and contact influences.},

                  This paper presents an alternative to Naroll's formula for estimating population size from settlement area. It uses an allometric model modified for hunter-gatherer camps. In this model, the parameters are derived theoretically to describe mean area per person and the geometric properties of population distribution. The proposed model is then tested on 16 !Kung Bushmen settlements.},

Therefore, given the beginnings of a theory of adaptation, it is possible to anticipate both differences in settlement-subsistence strategies and patterning in the archaeological record through a more detailed knowledge of the distribution of environmental variables.},

 abstract = {Ethnoarchaeological data indicate that various factors, including size of prey, influence both transport of animal parts and how animals are reduced to humanly usable or consumable portions. Remains of two taxa of pinnipeds of markedly different body size from two sites of similar age on the southern Northwest Coast of North America do not vary significantly in skeletal parts represented, which suggests similar transport histories. Butchering marks on bones of both taxa indicate that the butchery procedure was intertaxonomically similar for joint disarticulation and limb filleting. Bones of the larger taxon display significantly more butchery marks than bones of the smaller one, indicating the larger taxon was subjected to much more intensive butchery than the smaller one due to differences in body size.

Los restos de dos taxones de pinípedos con marcada diferencia de tamaño recuperados en dos sitios contemporáneos en el sur de la costa Noroeste de Norteamérica no varían significativamente en las partes esqueletarias representadas, sugiriendo que ambos poseen historias de transporte semejantes. Las marcas de destazamiento en los huesos indican que en ambos taxones se utilizaron procedimientos similares de desarticulación y fileteaje de las extremidades.

 abstract = {Stable-isotopic studies of prehistoric diet have usually confined discussions of isotopic variability within populations to sex-related differences in diet and have rarely considered other social or cultural sources of dietary variation. Extant data from eastern North America suggest that isotopic variation (and hence dietary variation) may have been greatest within the relatively complex Middle Mississippian societies of the late prehistoric period. Correlations between isotopic variability and mortuary variability (an indication of social position) were identified in a sample of burials from the Angel site, a Middle Mississippian (A.D. 1200-1450) civic-ceremonial center in southwestern Indiana. These correlations demonstrate how contextually informed isotopic studies can be used to examine the relations between social position and diet. This approach may be especially useful for studies of social interactions between different populations.
Resumen Los estudios sobre dietas prehistóricas mediante el análisis de isótopos estables normalmente confinan la interpretación de la variabilidad isotópica dentro de poblaciones a diferencias en la alimentación relacionadas con el sexo, ignorandopor lo general otras causas sociales y culturales de variación en la dieta. Datos disponibles para el Este de Norteamérica sugieren que la variación isotópica (y por consiguiente la variación en la dieta) alcanzó un nivel máximo en las sociedades relativamente complejas "Middle Mississippi" del período prehistórico tardío. Correlaciones entre variabilidad isotópica y variabilidad funeraria (un indicador de posición social) fueron identificadas en una muestra de enterramientos del sitio Angel, un centro cívico-ceremonial Middle Mississippi (1200-1450 D. C.) en el suroeste de Indiana. Estas correlaciones demuestran cómo los estudios isotópicos pueden ser utilizados para examinar las relaciones entre posición social y dieta cuando se toman en cuenta los contextos.

 abstract = {Most zooarchaeologists estimate limb-bone abundance from limb ends. Researchers have provided detailed documentation of the preferential destruction by carnivores of limb ends (Binford 1981; Binford et al. 1988; Blumenschine 1988; Brain 1981; Marean et al. 1990; Orloff and Marean 1990; Sutcliffe 1970). Others have observed differences between limb abundances calculated on limb shafts vs. ends, suggesting shaft pieces may provide more accurate estimates of original element abundance in carnivore-ravaged assemblages (Bunn 1986; Bunn and Kroll 1986; Blumenschine 1988; Klein 1975; Marean et al. 1990; Orloff and Marean 1990). However, the exact quantitative effect of carnivore ravaging on measures of element abundance has never been investigated. We provide an experimental test of the accuracy of different bone portions for estimating the original element abundance after carnivore ravaging. Spotted hyenas were allowed to ravage 33 simulated archaeological sites of known element abundance. Estimates of abundance calculated on limb ends differ greatly from original bone abundance, and estimates based on proximal/distal-shaft pieces are also inaccurate. Estimates from middle-shaft fragments, however, are uniquely accurate. These experimental data mandate reanalysis of assemblages where limb frequencies were calculated from limb ends and carnivore ravaging is implicated, and experimentally vindicate observations originally provided by Klein (1975).
Résumé

Otros han observado diferencias entre la abundancia de miembros calculada en base a las diáfisis y las epífisis de los miembros, sugiriendo que los restos de diáfisis pueden proporcionar estimaciones más exactas de la abundancia original de elementos en conjuntos afectados por carnívoros (Bunn 1986; Bunn y Kroll 1986; Blumenschine 1988; Klein 1975; Marean et al. 1990; Orloff y Marean 1990). Sin embargo, el efecto cuantitativo preciso del descarne por obra de carnívoros sobre las medidas de abundancia de elementos no ha sido investigado. Se ofrece una prueba experimental de la exactitud de diferentes porciones de huesos para estimar la abundancia original de elementos luego del descarne por carnívoros. Se permitió que hienas manchadas atacaran 33 sitios arqueológicos simulados con abundancias de elementos conocidas. Las estimaciones de abundancia calculadas sobre la base de epífisis difieren significativamente de la abundancia original de huesos; estimaciones basadas en fragmentos de diáfisis proximales/distales son también inexactas, en tantos que cálculos sobre fragmentos centrales de diáfisis proporcionan estimaciones singularmente precisas. Estos datos experimentales exigen un nuevo análisis de conjuntos en los que las frecuencias de extremidades han sido calculadas a partir de epífisis existiendo la posibilidad de actividad por parte de carnívoros.

 abstract = {Utility-based studies are attractive to zooarchaeologists because they afford the opportunity of investigating economic decisions relative to particular contexts. While a positive relationship between utility and skeletal element abundance is anticipated at residential sites, a reverse utility curve is most common. A popular mechanistic explanation argues that reverse utility curves result from density-mediated destruction of bone, suggesting that utility-based studies will rarely be successful as density-mediated destruction will overwhelm any skeletal element patterning created by differential transport. We show with archaeological and experimental/naturalistic taphonomic data that the mechanistic explanation is overstated. Fauna from Kobeh cave (a Mousterian site) and "Ain Dara (an Iron Age site) both show a reverse utility pattern when estimates of long bone abundance are based just on ends (the procedure followed at all sites that have shown a reverse utility pattern), and all bones are plotted together. When long bone abundance is estimated from the middle shaft portion, the reverse utility pattern collapses and a positive relationship arises. The ubiquity of the reverse utility curve derives in many cases from basing long bone abundance estimates on ends and scatter-plotting the abundance of long bones with non-long bones, thus restricting the analysis to the least dense most spongy bone portions. Long bone abundance estimates must include the middle shaft portion to attain accurate estimates of element abundance. Long bone abundance, when based on shaft portions, can be usefully compared to utility to investigate utility-based models of human behavior.
Los estudios zooarqueológicos basados en la utilidad de los elementos óseos brindan la oportunidad de investigar decisions económicas en contextes particulares. Aunque usualmente se anticipa una relatión positiva entre utilidad y abundancia de elementos óseos en sitios residenciales, la curva de utilidad negativa es más común. Una explication mecanistica popular sostiene que tal curva es el producto de destruction diferencial de huesos determinada por densidad más no por transporte; por lo tanto, los estudios de utilidad son raramente exitosos. Utilizando datas arqueológicos y experimentales/naturísticos tafonómicos demostramos que la explicatión mecanística es exagerada. La fauna de la cueva Kobeh (un sito musteriense) y de 'Ain Dara (un sitio de la Edad de Hierro) revela un patrón de utilidad negative cuando los cálcules de abundancia de huesos largos se basan solamente en los extremes de los huesos y vice versa. Por lo tanto, el cálculo de la abundancia de huesos largos debe incluir la portion media del hueso para obtener una aproximación acertada de abundancia de elementos. De esta manera se pueden obtener comparaciones productivas entre utliidad y abundancia para investigar modelos de conducta humana basados en utliidad.},

 abstract = {Ground-stone tools and hunter-gatherer subsistence in late Pleistocene southwest Asia are examined in light of ethnographic and experimental data on processing methods essential for consumption of various plant foods. In general, grinding and pounding appear to be labor-intensive processing methods. In particular, the labor required to make wild cereals edible has been widely underestimated, and wild cereals were unlikely to have been “attractive” to foragers except under stress conditions. Levantine ground-stone tools were probably used for processing diverse plants. The earliest occurrence of deep mortars coincides with the glacial maximum, camp reoccupations, the onset of increasingly territorial foraging, and the earliest presently known significant samples of wild cereals. Two major episodes of intensification in plant-food processing can be identified in the Levant, coinciding respectively with the earliest evidence for sedentism (12,800-11,500 B.P.) and the transition to farming (11,500-9600 B.P.). The latter episode was characterized by rising frequencies of grinding tools relative to pounding tools, and suggests attempts to maximize nutritional returns of plants harvested from the limited territories characteristic of sedentary foraging and early farming. This episode was probably encouraged by the Younger Dryas, when density and storability of foods may have outweighed considerations of processing costs.
Resumen Las henamientas de moler y la subsistencia de cazadores-recolectores en el Pleistoceno tardío del suroeste asiático se examinan bajo la luz de datos etnográficos y experimentales sobre los métodos de procesamiento esenciales para el consumo de varios tipos de plantas. En general, los métodos usados para moler y pulverizar requieren trabajo intensivo. En particular, el trabajo requerido para convertir cereales silvestres en comestibles ha sido sumamente subestimado; los cereales silvestres no fueron muy “atractivos” para los forajeros excepto bajo condiciones de presión. Las herramientas de moler levantinas probablemente fueron usadas para procesar diversas plantas. La ocurrencia más temprana de morteros hondos coincide con el máximo glacial, las reocupaciones de campamentos, la aparición de forraje territorial, y las muestras de cereales silvestres más tempranas que se conocen. Dos episodios importantes en la intensificación del procesamiento de plantas pueden identificarse en el Levante, coincidiendo respectivamente con la evidencia más temprana de sedentismo (12.800-11.500 A.P.) y con la transición hacia la agricultura (11.500-9600 B.P.). Este último episodio se caracterizó por frequencias crecientes de herramientas de moler en relación con herramienteas de pulverizar, y sugiere un intento de maximizar el rendimiento nutritivo de plantas cosechadas en los limitados territorios característicos del forraje sedentario y la agricultura temprana. Este episodio fue probablemente estimulado por el Dryas Reciente, cuando la densidad y capacidad de almacenamiento de comestibles habría sido más importante que los costos de procesamiento.},

 abstract = {In an effort to understand the relative advantages and drawbacks of the minimum number of individuals (MNI) and number of identifiable specimens (NISP) for quantifying body-part representation in faunas from archaeological sites, we analyzed relations among NISP, MNI, fragmentation, and bulk density in the fauna from Ngamuriak, a Kenyan pastoral Neolithic site. Our findings suggest that MNI is at least as sensitive as NISP to effects of fragmentation. While MNI decreases with increasing fragmentation, NISP moves in two directions with fragmentation, increasing at low levels of fragmentation and decreasing at high levels of fragmentation. In addition, MNI appears more sensitive than NISP to the relative identifiability of different body parts. We believe MNI may be a less representative descriptor of relative element frequency than NISP in highly fragmented assemblages.

Ngamuriak es un sitio pastoral del período Neolítico de Kenya. Nuestros resultados indican que el MNI es tan sensitivo a los efectos de fragmentación como lo es el NISP. Mientras que el MNI sólo disminuye al incrementarse la fragmentación, el NISP se mueve en ambas direcciones al aplicarse fragmentación: crece a bajos niveles de fragmentación, y disminuye al incrementarse los niveles de fragmentación. Además, el MNI parece ser más sensitivo que el NISP a la identificación diferencial de diferentes huesos fragmentados. Comparado con el NISP, nosotros creemos que el MNI describe con menor precisión las frecuencias relativas de huesos en colecciones altamente fragmentadas.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the application of mammalian taxonomic diversity measures in the analysis of human subsistence. Employing qualitative and quantitative taphonomic analyses on archaeofaunas recovered from a sheltered Fremont site in Utah, numerous small- and medium-sized animal bones (especially Leporidae) are identified as nonhuman accumulations. Measures of taxonomic diversity for the shelter’s entire assemblage suggest that the inhabitants practiced a generalized, broad-spectrum subsistence strategy. Omitting the nonhuman accumulations and calculating similar measures on bones interpreted as human refuse produce a different portrait of subsistence practices. Using this investigation as a case study, mammalian faunal assemblages from six additional Fremont assemblages are examined to further demonstrate that subsistence inferences based on diversity measures should be approached with caution. We demonstrate that measures of taxonomic diversity are valuable tools but should be used in concert with analyses of taphonomic agents. Furthermore, rather than employing only those bones identified to species, we emphasize that specimens identified to taxonomic genera may offer adequate resolution in examining prehistoric diet breadth.
Resumen Este ensayo examinará la aplicación de las medidas de la taxonómica mamífera en el análisis de la subsistencia humana. Empleará los análisis tafonómicos cualitativos y cuantitativos de las arquaofaunas recuperadas en Utah. El lugar en donde se encontraron estas arquaofaunas es uno de los Fremont yfue en un sitio que estaba simpre protegido de al intemperie. Se identifican como acumulaciones no humanos los numerosos huesos de animates (especialmente los Leporinos), que son huesos pequeños y de tamano mediano. Las medidas de diversidad taxonomíca para el poblado en su totalidad que vivia en el sitio sugieren que los habitantes utilizaban una estrategia generalizada y de un espectro amplio para la subsistencia. Al omitir las acumulaciones no humanos, y al calcular medidas similares sobre los huesos que están interpretados como desperdicios humanos, nos produce una representación bastante diferente de las costumbres para lo de la subsistencia. Al utilizar estas examinaciones como un caso de investigación, se estudian la presencia mamífera y las abundancias de seis poblados adicionales de los Fremont. De esta forma se muestra la forma en que las inferencias de subsistencia, basadas en las medidas de diversidad, se debe dirigirse con cautela. Se muestra que las medidas de la diversidad taxonómica son herramientas valiosas, pero no que se deben utilizar a menos que se midan e identifiquen los factores tafonómicos. Además, en lugar de sólo emplear los huesos identificados a ciertas especies, nostros ponemos énfasis en que los especímenes identificados a sus géneros taxonómicos ofrescan una solución adecuada para examinar la extensión de la dieta prehistórica.},

 abstract = {Animal bones discarded by people are commonly subject to disturbance by carnivores. These carnivores are present throughout the world and include wolves, coyotes, hyenas, and many others. This disturbance not only modifies and destroys bone, but also moves many of the bone fragments away from their original position of discard. Intrasite spatial analyses of bone that seek patterns meaningful to human behavior thus need to subtract the effect of carnivore disturbance. Experimental studies with spotted hyenas show that the position of a bone fragment on a limb bone, combined with bone surface modification, can be used to identify a class of bone fragments that are minimally affected by carnivores and are thus the best indicators of spatial patterning resulting from human behavior. Limb-bone ends are moved significant distances, as are shaft fragments as a general class. However, middle-shaft portions of limb bones that preserve percussion marks from hammerstone breakage retain nearly the precise spatial position as originally discarded by hominids. Thus, any spatial analysis of bone, when carnivores are implicated as contributors or consumers at an archaeological site, should focus on middle-shaft portions of limb bones with percussion marks.
Resumen
                  Los huesos animales desechados por la gente se hallan comúnmente expuestos a la perturbación por parte de carnívoros. Tales carnívoros están presentes en todo el globo e incluyen a lobos, coyotes, hienas y muchos otros. Estas perturbaciones no sólo modifican y destruyen el material óseo, sino que también ocasionan el transporte de muchos fragmentos óseos a lugares distantes del sitio donde inicialmente se encontraban. Los análisis espaciales de huesos que buscan patrones significativos del comportamiento humano necesitan por lo tanto considerar el efecto de esta perturbación por parte de los carnívoros. Ciertos estudios experimentales con hienas manchadas demuestran que la posición delfragmento óseo de una extremidad, junto con la modificación de la superficie ósea pueden ser utilizadas para identificar alguna clase de fragmentos escasamente afectados por carnívoros. Dicha clase de fragmentos óseos es la mejor indicadora de la distribución espacial resultante del comportamiento humano. Tanto las terminaciones de una extremidad como los fragmentos a lo largo del eje de ésta, en general, son desplazados distancias significativos. Sin embargo, las porciones correspondientes a los puntos intermedios de una extremidad, que conservan marcas de percusión ocasionadas por golpes de martillo, mantienen una ubicación espacial precisa, bastante próximo a aquélla en la que fueron originalmente desechados por los homínidos. Por lo tanto, cualquier análisis espacial de huesos que implique a carnivoros como contribuyentes o consumidores en un sitio arqueológico debe enfocarse en las porciones ubicadas en el punto intermedio de los huesos de una extremidad, acompanadas de señales de martillo.},

 abstract = {Fifteen years ago Casteel and Grayson (1977) identified potential ambiguity in the definitions of quantitative terms and units used by zooarchaeologists. As solutions they suggested that analysts use the original definitions of terms and explicitly specify how units are counted. The history of zooarchaeology since then has involved a shift from producing estimates of taxonomic abundances to measuring various taphonomic processes and effects within taxa. As a result, many new quantitative units and terms for those units have been proposed. Some of these new units and terms have been used to measure properties of bone assemblages that are not clearly related to a taphonomic process or effect. Other units and terms have been used inappropriately due to apparent misunderstanding of the property measured by a unit or due to some assumed, implicit meaning of a term. The 112 terms compiled for this study have 122 distinct definitions. Some of the designated quantitative units are synonymous with one another while other units are used in ambiguous manners that seriously compromise their reliability. Explicit definitions of quantitative units and terms along with detailed descriptions of how individual units are measured are mandatory to the efficient communication of research results and the continued prosperity of zooarchaeological research.

Como resultado, se han propuesto muchas unidades cuantitativos nuevas además de los términos para ellas. Algunos de estos términos y unidades nuevas se han utilizado para medir las propiedades de las colecciones de huesos que no están claramente relacionadas con algún proceso o efecto tafonómico.

 abstract = {While providing a review of some of the ethnographic literature surrounding hunting and Costly Signaling Theory, Codding and Jones offer no alternative framework for how this emerging theoretical approach might be applied to the archaeological record. In their view, Costly Signaling Theory lies beyond the pale of current archaeological inquiry, or at least our conception of it. We respond to this characterization by providing a specific methodological approach, combined with several additional applications, that answer Codding and Jones's call for greater linkage between the theory and the archaeological record. Ultimately, we believe that the archaeological record, with its temporal dimension, may illuminate some of the underlying aspects of Costly Signaling Theory that are otherwise obscured by more synchronic ethnographic studies.
Résumé
                  Aunque ofrecen una revisión de parte de la literatura etnográfica que rodea la caza y la teoría altruista (Costly Signaling), Codding y Jones dimiten en proponer un marco alternativo para explicar cómo este incipiente enfoque teórico puede aplicarse al registro arqueológico. Según ellos, la teoría altruista (Costly Signaling) se encuentra fuera de las normas comúnmente aceptadas de la indagación arqueológica, o al menos de nuestro concepto de ésta. Respondemos a esta caracterización a través de un enfoque metodológico específico, combinado con varias aplicaciones adicionales, que responde a la exigencia de Codding y Jones de un vínculo más estrecho entre teoría y registro arqueológico. En fin, creemos que el registro arqueológico, con su dimensión temporal, puede clarificar algunos de los aspectos subyacentes de la teoría altruista (Costly Signaling), que de otra manera permanecerían opacados por estudios sincrónicos con carácter etnográfico.},

 abstract = {Assemblages are composed of proportions of artifacts by category. Use life affects the formation and therefore the size and composition of assemblages. Use life is to assemblage formation as lifespan is to demography, and demographers know that a population's mean lifespan is no more important than the distribution of values around that mean. When considered at all, use life typically is expressed as a mean value. But use-life's distribution—variation around the mean—affects assemblage composition independently of the mean. Distribution is neglected because its effects are not appreciated and seem difficult to measure. To improve understanding of assemblage formation, we study use-life distribution in New Guinea Wola ethnographic artifacts, using cumulative survivorship and the two-parameter Weibull model. Then we propose estimates of use-life distribution in Paleoindian stone tools. Knowing use-life distribution as well as mean, we know better how assemblages formed and improve our understanding of the archaeological record.
Resumen
                  Los conjuntos arqueológicos constan de proporciones de artefactos por categoría. La vida útil influye en la formación y, por lo tanto, el tamaño y composición de los conjuntos. La vida útil se relaciona con la formación de conjuntos como la duración de vida se relaciona con la demografía, y los demógrafos saben que el tiempo promedio de vida no es más importante que la distribución de valores respecto a la media. Cuando se consideran, típicamente la vida útil se expresan como un valor promedio. Pero la distribución B variación de la vida util respecto a la media B afecta la composición de los conjuntos en forma independiente de la media. Los arqueólogos no prestan atención a la distribución, tal vez porque sus afectos no se aprecian y son difíciles de medir. Para lograr un mejor entendimiento de la formación de conjuntos arqueológicos, en este artículo se estudia la distribución de la vida útil calculada para categorías de artefactos o herramientas etnográficas Wola, de Nueva Guinea, con base en un modelo de supervivencia acumulativa y el modelo Weibull con dos parámetros. Además, se presentan cálculos de la distribución de la vida útil de especimenes arqueológicos paleoindios. Al conocer la distribución de la vida útil al igual que la media, se logra una mejor idea de cómo seforman los conjuntos y mejoramos nuestro entendimiento del registro arqueológico.},

 abstract = {Resumen Desde principios de siglo se ha propuesto la coexistencia de los gliptodontes con los cazadores recolectores pleistocénicos de la región pampeana, pero las evidencias presentadas para apoyar esta hipótesis fueron ambiguas. El componente inferior del sitio La Moderna (región pampeana, República Argentina) indica que un representante de esta familia, Doedicurus clavicaudatus, fue faenado a orillas de un pantano, utilizando un instrumental expeditivo de cuarzo cristalino, hacia ca. 7,000 a 7,500 a. P. En este artículo se presenta una síntesis de los hallazgos de La Moderna y se resume y discute también el registro de restos de gliptodontes y de un armadillo extinto (Eutatus seguini) de otros sitios arqueológicos pampeanos. Los hallazgos de La Moderna y de otros sitios con fauna pleistocénica, tales como Arroyo Seco 2, apoyan la hipótesis de que en la región pampeana, la mayoría de las extinciones faunísticas se produjeron luego de los 10,000 a. P. y que en consecuencia, varios géneros pleistocénicos sobrevivieron hasta el final del Holoceno temprano.
Although the coexistence of early hunter-gatherers and glyptodons in the pampa region of Argentina has been proposed since the beginning of this century, evidence to support this hypothesis has remained ambiguous. The lower component of the archaeological site of La Moderna (pampean region, Argentina) includes a representative of this family, Doedicurus clavicaudatus, that was butchered at the edge of a swamp. A series of radiocarbon dates places the occupation of the site at ca. 7,000 to 7,500 years B. P. This paper synthesizes archaeological findings from La Moderna and places it in the context of other pampean archaeological sites in which glyptodon and extinct armadillo (Eutatus seguini) remains have been recovered. Based on this synthetic overview, it now seems clear that pleistocene megafauna survived for several millennia after 10,000 years B. P., thereby coexisting with the region’s earliest inhabitants.},

 abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review the basis for an interdisciplinary course known as Man and Food, a hybrid of the agricultural and social sciences. The nucleus of the course may be expressed as: The tendency of life systems as a function of time and size is toward closure! The postulate of closure applies to the modern university and particularly to scientific and technological disciplines such as engineering, medicine, forestry and agriculture. However, it is really no less applicable to literature, history, mathematics and music. The result is, as C. P. Snow (1969) puts it, a “growing abyss” of misunderstanding between the arts and the sciences. To this might well be added the erosion of public attitudes toward higher education. Of equal, if not greater concern is the reflection of the phenomenon of closure in many students whose educational careers have made it increasingly difficult for them to explore beyond the prescribed limits of their “major.” Their images of intellectual identity draw less and less support for their formation from outside the field of interest.},

 abstract = {It is unclear whether the capabilities of recreationally active modern humans are unique due to present training practices or linked to the selection resulting from migration, escape, scavenging, and hunting and/or endurance running in early Homo. The purpose of this study was to determine upper values for total energy expenditure (TEE) and water turnover during sustained work for periods of 12-24 and 12-48 h, respectively and compare them with other species and proposed activities of early Homo. Stable isotopic water (2H2 18O) was used during competitions in hot environments to establish energy expenditure rates of approaching 10 times resting metabolism (RM) for 12.7 and 26.8 h, respectively. These events demonstrate pronounced hydration demands, with water output rates ranging from 25–95% of initial total body water for events lasting 12–48 h, respectively. These results provide new evidence for a high, sustained work (0.5–2 days) output and hydration demand in humans compared to other species in hot environments. Although the span for sustained metabolic activity in humans is large, it does not require elite level training status so long as adequate exogenous fuel and water are accessible. Because these values far exceed reported expectations/needs for foraging and persistence hunting in early Homo, it remains unclear if the phenomenon of the metabolic range is a modern human characteristic. While modern recreational endurance participants can demonstrate a TEE approaching 10 times RM, the rationale and need for such a high human metabolic ceiling is unclear when considering the energy demands of early Homo.},

But I also lean on what they differ from one another. The geo-historical field, which in 1975 includes hunter-gatherer societies, the ginecoestatic agricultural societies and ginecomobile agricultural societies, while in 2001 it embraces hunter-gatherer societies, adelphic societies (both ginecostatic and ginecomobile) and aristocratic societies. And above all, the understanding of kinship: in 1975 as filiation –which led him to argue that the relationships within hordes of hunters and gatherers were those of adhesion, not of kinship– and in 2001 as the sustainment of daily life and reproduction, hence aiming at most intimate and lasting relationships.},

La unitat d’aquestes ciències necessita un model comú de comportament humà individual al darrere, especificat i enriquit per satisfer les necessitats particulars de cada disciplina. No existeix aquesta unitat i no pot ser assolida fàcilment, ja que les diferents disciplines tenen models incompatibles i metodologies d’investigació dispars. Amb tot, desenvolupaments teòrics empírics i recents han creat les condicions per a la unitat de les ciències del comportament incorporant principis centrals en tots els camps i basant-se en eines teòriques (com la teoria de jocs i el model d’actor racional) i tècniques de recollida de dades (com els jocs experimentals de laboratori i sobre el terreny) que transcendeixen les fronteres disciplinàries. Aquests desenvolupaments inclouen: a ) la teoria de jocs evolutiva i conductual, que proporciona un lèxic transdisciplinari per a la comunicació i la construcció de models; b ) el model d’actor racional, ancorat en la biologia però desenvolupat per la teoria econòmica, que s’aplica en totes les disciplines del comportament humà. Aquest model tracta les accions com a instrumentals, dirigides a la satisfacció de les preferències. Malgrat això, el contingut de les preferències ha de ser determinat empíricament. A més, el model d’actor racional està basat en una noció de la consistència de les preferències que no se satisfà universalment, de manera que el seu rang d’aplicabilitat ha de determinar-se també de manera empírica; c ) els experiments controlats, que s’han infrautilitzat en la major part de les ciències del comportament.

                  I present archaeobotanical evidence for intensive and long-term harvesting of edible geophytes in the Brodiaea complex, most likely blue dicks (Dichelostemma capitatum), during multiple seasons on California’s Santa Cruz Island. Ethnographic data indicate that Brodiaea corms were an important food source throughout prehistoric California, usually harvested in the late spring–early summer, after flowering. However, at least two ethnographic sources may suggest multiple seasons of harvest, an idea supported by careful examination of seasonal morphological changes in modern and ancient Brodiaea corms. Archaeobotanical identification of features associated with these morphological changes allows inferences about the specific seasons in which Brodiaea corms were harvested, a conclusion that has the potential to provide higher resolution seasonality data for geophyte remains recovered in western North America and other areas around the world.
Resumen
                  En este artículo presento evidencia arqueobotánica de la recolección intensiva y a largo plazo de geófitos comestibles pertenecientes al complejo Brodiaea, muy probablemente Covenas (Dichelostemma capitatum), durante múltiples temporadas en la Isla Santa Cruz en California. Los datos etnográficos indican que los bulbos de plantas Brodiaea constituyeron una fuente importante de alimento a lo largo de la prehistoria de California, y fueron usualmente recolectados después de su florecimiento durante la parte tardía de la primavera e inicios del verano. Sin embargo, al menos dos fuentes etnográficas adicionales sugieren múltiples temporadas de recolección, una posibilidad sustentada por el cuidadoso estudio de cambios morfológicos estacionales en bulbos de Brodiaea antiguos y modernos. La identificación arqueobotánica de rasgos asociados a estos cambios morfológicos permite establecer inferencias sobre las estaciones específicas en que los bulbos de Brodiaea fueron recolectados, y esta conclusión tiene el potencial de brindar datos de estacionalldad de mayor resolución para los restos de geófitos recuperados en el oeste de Norteamérica y otras áreas alrededor del mundo.},

 abstract = {People across societies engage in costly sharing, but the extent of such sharing shows striking cultural variation, highlighting the importance of local norms in shaping generosity. Despite this acknowledged role for norms, it is unclear when they begin to exert their influence in development. Here we use a Dictator Game to investigate the extent to which 4- to 9-year-old children are sensitive to selfish (give 20%) and generous (give 80%) norms. Additionally, we varied whether children were told how much other children give (descriptive norm) or what they should give according to an adult (injunctive norm). Results showed that children generally gave more when they were exposed to a generous norm. However, patterns of compliance varied with age. Younger children were more likely to comply with the selfish norm, suggesting a licensing effect. By contrast, older children were more influenced by the generous norm, yet capped their donations at 50%, perhaps adhering to a pre-existing norm of equality. Children were not differentially influenced by descriptive or injunctive norms, suggesting a primacy of norm content over norm format. Together, our findings indicate that while generosity is malleable in children, normative information does not completely override pre-existing biases.},

@article{pub.1074199553,
 abstract = {Since the influential work of Michael B. Schiffer on formation processes has been published in 1987, much has advanced on the part of environmental formation processes also known as N-transforms. Most new knowledge is the result of research conducted by geoarchaeologists. On the theoretical level, a huge leap forward was made with the realization that occupation deposits are artifacts of human activity. The focus of formation theory thus shifted from the artifact to the deposit. Methodological innovations and a geoarchaeological tool-kit, notably including the contextual technique of micromorphology, followed. Empirical studies of archaeological occupation deposits contributed new spatial and stratigraphic knowledge and understanding. A holistic middle-range methodology termed geo-ethnoarchaeology was developed, whereby macroscopic and microscopic artifacts are studied together with their associated sediments in ethnographic contexts, providing contextual (social) information about the relationship between artifacts and the surrounding sediments as archaeological assemblages form. This method is especially powerful when sequentially dated abandoned settlements or features are studied to provide mechanistic understanding of assemblage and/or site formation through degradation. Because geo-ethnoarchaeology is based on general chemical, biological and physical laws, the resultant mechanistic models are applicable globally, for any time period, culture, and environment. The new tools and mechanistic understanding by which N-transforms are currently studied, provide means to more reliably interpret the archaeological record, which is crucial for the credibility of archaeology. Therefore, when studying archaeological assemblages one should utilize the tool-kit developed by geoarchaeologists to first assess the states of preservation of the various material assemblages (macroscopic and microscopic), as it should be borne in mind that assemblages identified to be well-preserved will produce the most reliable archaeological interpretation. The theory and method of geoarchaeology have matured enough to allow responsible archaeological research into the meaning of spatial and temporal (stratigraphic) patterns at any given site.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D ratio) can be assumed a valid indicator of sexual differentiation, provided that it is stable once it develops, or eventual changes remain uniform in a respective cohort throughout ontogenesis. The main goal of this study was to determine whether the metacarpal 2M:4M and the digit 2D:4D ratio change during the period of pubertal/adolescent growth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The metacarpals and digits were measured on radiographs of left hands in the sample of 328 individuals (96 pairs of male and 68 pairs of female twins) from the Wrocław Longitudinal Study of Twins (1967-1983). Five consecutive annual measurements were done for each individual within a 4-year-interval somewhere between 7 and 18 years of age. Age-related changes in both ratios were studied using a set of mixed-effects linear models. Three types of correlation coefficients were used for assessment of stability between repeated measurements at different ages.
RESULTS: An overall decrease in the average 2M:4M ratio was observed, attributable to a much larger extent to males than to females. On the contrary, a slight overall increase in the average 2D:4D ratio was observed, attributable to a much larger extent to females than to males. The rank order of the ratios remained highly stable within the monitored period (the correlation coefficient mostly ranged between 0.85 and 0.95). In spite of these findings, we recorded significant intraindividual changes in both ratios. In some individuals the 2D:4D ratio can undergo changes comparable to average sex differences and much higher than average age-related changes.
DISCUSSION: Relatively slight overall changes in digit ratio in puberty and adolescence themselves are not inconsistent with the use of the 2D:4D ratio as an indirect marker of prenatal sexual differentiation. Nevertheless, individual changes in the ratios varied substantially in this study and differed from the average trends. Future studies should focus on the nature of interindividual developmental differences in the digit and metacarpal ratios.},

 abstract = {This paper presents data on cutmarks obtained through experimental butchery performed within a collective project called “des Traces & des Hommes”. Eighteen half-carcasses of red deer (Cervus elaphus) were processed using replicas of Middle Palaeolithic stone tools. The butchery complied with a strict protocol to allow the activity that produced each cutmark to be identified with confidence. The gestures of the butcher and every instance of contact between the tools and bones were also recorded. Each bone has been analyzed using a magnifying lens, and the cutmarks have been recorded on graphic templates of the bones. Comparison of our experimental data with the other available reference sets highlights several differences and important issues potentially leading to misinterpretation of butchering activities in archaeological contexts. In order to improve our ability to document butchering patterns, we introduce an updated, more complete and more detailed version of the cutmark coding system created by Binford (1981) and later supplemented by Nilssen (2000). The experiments conducted also allowed us to expand our understanding of some poorly documented activities, such as tendon-extraction and skinning.},

Using the social movemenet theory, the author analyzes the extent to which MTA uses cultural dakwah or symbolic-cultural mobilization as its dakwah strategy in order to produce counter-interpretation towards the established and hegemonic interpretation of the Javanese culture. Cultural dakwah can mean a bolization process of Javanese symbols by ataching new meaning and interpretation to thos symbols. The author further argues that even though the MTA’s dakwah movement is mainly characterized by confontative attitudes, the MATA has also shown its acomodative character by introducing new new understanding and meaning of the existing cultural symbols.

 abstract = {The emergence of cooperation in human societies has received ample academic attention from different disciplines, and is usually considered as an adaptive response to competition over scarce resources. In this article, the authors review the specific contribution that social anthropology has made to this field of research. They propose that social anthropology has contributed to this field through the description of systems that have regulated both cooperation and competition in traditional societies: (1) hunter‐gatherer societies, where generalized reciprocity dominates; (2) prestige economies, which includes the exchange of valuables in specific spheres, primitive money, agonistic institutions in tribes; and last, (3) ‘moral economies’ in peasant communities, where cooperation and competition coexist but never at the cost of putting at risk the reproduction of the community itself or of some of its members. The three systems share the basic mechanism of reciprocity that allows for the maintenance of equality, as well as the very language for regulating competition in unequal prestige or moral economies. This pervasive presence of reciprocity as a moral norm would reveal its basic role in human evolution, and, likely, its co‐evolution with ritual forms of social exchange.},

 abstract = {Here, we present the analysis of occlusal molar microwear textures of eight individuals from the El Sidrón Neandertal group (Spain). The aims of the study were: 1) to document potential age-, sex-, and maternal lineage-related differences in diet within a Neandertal familial group, and 2) to place the diet of El Sidrón individuals in the context of those of other Neandertal groups. This study also offers an interpretation of the diet of the El Sidrón Neandertals by comparing their microwear signatures to those of recent hunter-gatherer populations with diverse but known diets. The intra-group examination of the microwear signatures are consistent with the females of the El Sidrón group having had more abrasive diets or having used their teeth in more para-masticatory activities than did the males. Aside from the potential sex-related differences in diet, no additional intra-group dietary separation, such as by age group or maternal lineage, was observed. In comparison to other Neandertals, El Sidrón individuals, as a group, have microwear signatures most similar to those of other Neandertals from wooded habitats and different from those that lived in more open habitats. This result is expected based on the available paleoenvironmental reconstructions from El Sidrón Cave. The diet of the El Sidrón Neandertals, just like their Neandertal counterparts from similar wooded habitats, is interpreted as having been mixed, consisting of both meat and vegetable foods.},

 abstract = {Pride occurs in every known culture, appears early in development, is reliably triggered by achievements and formidability, and causes a characteristic display that is recognized everywhere. Here, we evaluate the theory that pride evolved to guide decisions relevant to pursuing actions that enhance valuation and respect for a person in the minds of others. By hypothesis, pride is a neurocomputational program tailored by selection to orchestrate cognition and behavior in the service of: (<i>i</i>) motivating the cost-effective pursuit of courses of action that would increase others' valuations and respect of the individual, (<i>ii</i>) motivating the advertisement of acts or characteristics whose recognition by others would lead them to enhance their evaluations of the individual, and (<i>iii</i>) mobilizing the individual to take advantage of the resulting enhanced social landscape. To modulate how much to invest in actions that might lead to enhanced evaluations by others, the pride system must forecast the magnitude of the evaluations the action would evoke in the audience and calibrate its activation proportionally. We tested this prediction in 16 countries across 4 continents (<i>n</i> = 2,085), for 25 acts and traits. As predicted, the pride intensity for a given act or trait closely tracks the valuations of audiences, local (mean <i>r</i> = +0.82) and foreign (mean <i>r</i> = +0.75). This relationship is specific to pride and does not generalize to other positive emotions that coactivate with pride but lack its audience-recalibrating function.},

 abstract = {It is often unclear whether an archaeological animal bonebed was formed by a mass kill of individuals from a single prey population or through the accumulation of a number of separate kills which occurred over a long time period or at multiple locations. The isotope ratio variation within animals from an archaeological bonebed can be used to investigate this question by comparing the isotope ratio variation within an archaeological assemblage to the variation within modern populations. If the archaeological variation exceeds that expected within a single population, then an accumulation is indicated. Otherwise, a single mass kill or a series of kills from a single population over a fairly short time period is more likely. This technique is demonstrated using carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotope ratios to characterize the amount of variation within pronghorn tooth enamel from six archaeological sites in southwestern Wyoming. The results indicate that the Austin Wash and Trappers Point sites are the result of an accumulation of pronghorn from multiple populations, while the Firehole Basin, Gailiun, and Boars Tusk sites do not show evidence of accumulation and therefore may be the result of mass kills. The Eden-Farson site formation characteristics are currently indeterminate.
Résumé
                  A menudo es difícil determinar si un depósito arqueológico de restos óseos de animal se formó a través de la muerte en masa de individuos de una única población de presas, o a través de la acumulación de un número de muertes por separado que tuvieron lugar durante un periodo de tiempo prolongado o en múltiples lugares. Es posible utilizar la variación de relaciones isotópicas en los animales de un depósito arqueológico de huesos para investigar dicha cuestión. La variación de relaciones isotópicas de un contexto arqueológico es comparada con la variación en de población moderna y, si la variación arqueológica supera aquella que se espera dentro de una única población, se indica una acumulación. De otra manera, es más probable una única muerte en masa o una serie de muertes de una única población a lo largo de un periodo de tiempo relativamente corto. Dicha técnica queda demostrada mediante el uso de relaciones isotópicas de carbono, oxígeno y estroncio para caracterizar la magnitud de la variación en el esmalte de dientes de antílopes americanos proveniente de seis yacimientos arqueológicos del sudoeste de Wyoming. Los resultados indican que los yacimientos de Austin Wash y Trappers Point son el resultado de una acumulación de antilocapras americanas de diversas poblaciones, mientras que los yacimientos de Firehole Basin, Gailiun y Boars Tusk no presentan evidencia de acumulación y por lo tanto pueden ser el resultado de muertes en masa únicas. Las características de la formación del yacimiento de Eden-Farson aún no han sido determinadas.},

 abstract = {The Jim Pitts site is a multicomponent Paleoindian locality in the Black Hills of South Dakota, with a rare Goshen residential occupation. All Paleoindian components were comprised in the Leonard paleosol. The deepest component at the site is a Goshen level dated to 10,185 ± 25 B.P. It correlates with a late fall-early winter camp site. Over the course of its use parts of at least five bison were procured and introduced to the site. Above this level an array of point styles, including Goshen, Folsom, Agate Basin, several Fishtail points, James Allen, Cody, and Alberta, have also been found. The following study provides a typological and technological description of the point assemblage and weighs the implications of the chrono-cultural stratigraphy for reconstructing the Paleoindian cultural landscape. It questions the validity of some types, particularly Goshen, as cultural and chronological markers. Ultimately, the evidence presented here reinforces a model in which multiple Paleoindian point types occur simultaneously on the central and northern Great Plains. This in turn challenges a unilineal view of Paleoindian culture history.

However, contact network structures in traditional small-scale societies, especially hunter-gatherers, are poorly characterized. We developed a portable wireless sensing technology (motes) to study within-camp proximity networks among Agta and BaYaka hunter-gatherers in fine detail. We show that hunter-gatherer social networks exhibit signs of increased efficiency2 for potential information exchange. Increased network efficiency is achieved through investment in a few strong links among non-kin ‘friends’ connecting unrelated families. We show that interactions with non-kin appear in childhood, creating opportunities for collaboration and cultural exchange beyond family at early ages. We also show that strong friendships are more important than family ties in predicting levels of shared knowledge among individuals. We hypothesize that efficient transmission of cumulative culture3–6 may have shaped human social networks and contributed to our tendency to extend networks beyond kin and form strong non-kin ties.},

 abstract = {This paper uses a Darwinian perspective to examine the nuclear arms race in the context of “arms races” in evolution and throughout human history. The rise of human “arms races,” or escalatory intergroup competition, is traced to a variety of environmental triggers initiated during the Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene. These triggers removed extraspecific environmental constraints to escalatory intergroup competition in some areas of the world, making it reproductively advantageous for individuals to live in increasingly larger and more competitive groups. This process is linked to the development of social complexity and the intensification of intergroup competition, warfare, and arms production, culminating in the nuclear arms race. Historically, escalatory intergroup competition has been reproductively advantageous to elites because it enables them to acquire a disproportionately large share of resources. It is argued that the continuation of the nuclear arms race past a level of mutual assured destruction results from the benefits it provides to elites as well as a variety of evolved behavioral mechanisms that encourage in-group affiliations, out-group hostilities, and obedience to authority.},

 abstract = {The KhoeSan populations are the earliest known indigenous inhabitants of southern Africa. The relatively recent expansion of Bantu-speaking agropastoralists, as well as European colonial settlement along the south–west coast, dramatically changed patterns of genetic diversity in a region which had been largely isolated for thousands of years. Owing to this unique history, population structure in southern Africa reflects both the underlying KhoeSan genetic diversity as well as differential recent admixture. This population structure has a wide range of biomedical and sociocultural implications; such as changes in disease risk profiles. Here, we consolidate information from various population genetic studies that characterize admixture patterns in southern Africa with an aim to better understand differences in adverse disease phenotypes observed among groups. Our review confirms that ancestry has a direct impact on an individual’s immune response to infectious diseases. In addition, we emphasize the importance of collaborative research, especially for populations in southern Africa that have a high incidence of potentially fatal infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis.},

 abstract = {Due to our intensive subsistence and habitat-modification strategies—including broad-spectrum harvesting and predation, widespread landscape burning, settlement construction, and translocation of other species—humans have major roles as ecological actors who influence fundamental trophic interactions. Here we review how the long-term history of human–environment interaction has shaped the evolutionary biology of diverse non-human, non-domesticated species. Clear examples of anthropogenic effects on non-human morphological evolution have been documented in modern studies of substantial changes to body size or other major traits in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants in response to selective human harvesting, urbanized habitats, and human-mediated translocation. Meanwhile, archaeological records of harvested marine invertebrates and terrestrial vertebrates suggest that similar processes extend considerably into prehistory, perhaps to 50,000 yr BP or earlier. These results are consistent with palaeoenvironmental and other records that demonstrate long-term human habitat modification and intensive harvesting practices. Thus, while considerable attention has been focused on recent human impacts on ‘natural’ habitats, integrated evidence from modern biology and archaeology suggests a deep history of human entanglement with our ecosystems including substantial effects on the evolutionary biology of non-human taxa. The number and magnitude of such effects will probably increase given the continued intensification of anthropogenic activities and ecosystem impacts, including climate change and direct genetic modification.},

The prehistory of this relationship between human distribution, cultural solutions and temperature conditions may help us to understand the evolution of human biological adaptations to cold temperature. Fire has long been seen as an important factor in human evolution and range expansion, particularly into temperate latitudes. Nevertheless, the earliest evidence for hominin presence in Eurasia, and middle latitudes in northern Europe, substantially predates convincing evidence for fire use in these regions. This review outlines the current state of knowledge of the chronology of hominin dispersal into temperate latitudes, from the earliest occupants to our own species, and the archeological evidence for fire use. Given continuing disagreement about this chronology and limitations to the archeological evidence, new, complementary approaches are worthwhile and would benefit from information from studies of current human temperature regulation.},

However, the role universals play in high-level aesthetic creativity is not well understood. After reviewing evolutionary aspects of aesthetics, some specific proposed aesthetic universals, and the nature of creativity in aesthetic domains, I examine a creative dynamic in which long-term pressure for novelty leads to inexorable tensions with canalized aesthetic biases. Examining the role of aesthetic universals in individuals’ creative processes, as well as more thorough trans-historical assessments of the development of universals, are proposed as methodological strategies for gaining traction on this issue. Such investigations have the potential to inform the role of the audience in shaping the evolution of artist styles, how universals play out in high versus low art, the possibility of identifying new aesthetic universals (perhaps particularly with conceptual art), and the relative value of novelty versus adaptive value in aesthetic creativity.},

 abstract = {Untermassfeld has provided a butchered bone assemblage and a Mode 1 lithic record demonstrating hominin presence at a site which was classically viewed as paleontological. This archaeological record was found during fieldwork and surveying in fluvial river banks and low-to-medium energy channel erosion sediments. Paleomagnetism and biostratigraphy has yielded an age for this hominin occupation close to the onset of the Jaramillo subchron (ca. 1.07 Myr). In this paper we present new taphonomic data of the cut-marked and hammer-related bone material, corresponding mainly to large-sized herd species (i.e., Bison), but also from cervids (Eucladoceros giulii and Cervus s.l. nestii vallonnetensis) and megafaunal species (i.e., Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis and Hippopotamus amphibius antiquus). Distribution of skeletal elements and bone surface features suggests that this bone assemblage consists of animal remains with different taphonomic origins. The assemblage formed during at most two or three sediment-laden floods, transporting both lithic tools and remains of animals that died of natural causes or were killed by predators. The new taphonomic results presented here are important to analyze hominin colonization and adaptation to European mid-latitude environments at 1 Myr, in competition for meat resources with large carnivores (i.e., Pachycrocuta brevirostris and Panthera onca gombaszoegensis).},

 abstract = {The incidence of colon cancer has increased considerably and the intestinal microbiota participate in the development of colon cancer. We showed that the L. casei Zhang or vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) intervention significantly alleviated intestinal tumor burden in mice. This was associated with increased serum adiponectin levels in both treatments. But osteocalcin level was only increased by L. casei Zhang. Furthermore, the anti-carcinogenic actions of L. casei Zhang were mediated by hepatic Chloride channel-3(CLCN3)/Nuclear Factor Kappa B(NF-κB) and intestinal Claudin15/Chloride intracellular channel 4(CLIC4)/Transforming Growth Factor Beta(TGF-β) signaling, while the vitamin K2 effect involved a hepatic Vitamin D Receptor(VDR)-phosphorylated AMPK signaling pathway. Fecal DNA sequencing by the Pacbio RSII method revealed there was significantly lower Helicobacter apodemus, Helicobacter mesocricetorum, Allobaculum stercoricanis and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens following both interventions compared to the model group. Moreover, different caecum acetic acid and butyric acid levels and enrichment of other specific microbes also determined the activity of the different regulatory pathways. Together these data show that L. casei Zhang and Vitamin K2 can suppress gut risk microbes and promote beneficial microbial metabolites to reduce colonic tumor development in mice.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The expansion of Numic speaking populations into the Great Basin required individuals to adapt to a relatively unproductive landscape. Researchers have proposed numerous social and subsistence strategies to explain how and why these settlers were able to replace any established populations, including private property and intensive plant processing. Here we evaluate these hypotheses and propose a new strategy involving the use of landscape fire to increase resource encounter rates.
METHODS: Implementing a novel, spatially explicit, multi-scalar prey choice model, we examine how individual decisions approximating each alternative strategy (private property, anthropogenic fire, and intensive plant processing) would aggregate at the patch and band level to confer an overall benefit to this colonizing population. Analysis relies on experimental data reporting resource profitability and abundance, ecological data on the historic distribution of vegetation patches, and ethnohistoric data on the distribution of Numic bands.
RESULTS: Model results show that while resource privatization and landscape fires produce a substantial advantage, intensified plant processing garners the greatest benefit. The relative benefits of alternative strategies vary significantly across ecological patches resulting in variation across ethnographic band ranges. Combined, a Numic strategy including all three alternatives would substantially increase subsistence yields.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of a strategy set that includes landscape fire, privatization and intensified processing of seeds and nuts, explains why the Numa were able to outcompete local populations. This approach provides a framework to help explain how individual decisions can result in such population replacement events throughout human history.},

 abstract = {The late Early Pleistocene site Barranc de la Boella provides an unparalleled opportunity to assess the context of the activities of the hominin populations that inhabited the Iberian Peninsula at 1Ma. Recently, strong evidence for access to mammoth meat has been described at the Pit 1 locality. At the la Mina and el Forn excavation areas, little evidence exists for the anthropogenic processing of macromammals. However, the presence of humans is recorded, and the available evidence suggests these populations had access to several interesting resources. By analysing and comparing five separate assemblages at Barranc de la Boella, we assess the fluctuating presence of hominins and carnivores and the levels of competition among predators in each assemblage. Our analysis reveals different levels of competition intensity during the formation of assemblages when hominin groups were present, as evidenced by the abundance and diversity of stone artefacts. The analyses of skeletal component ratios indicate several competitive contexts, and the greatest presence of hominin groups is associated with the most competitive scenarios. The palaeoenvironment at Barranc de la Boella was rich in resources that hominins could exploit. The presence of hominin and carnivore groups appears to have been higher in levels with more inferred competition. This scenario supports prior research that concludes that carnivore abundance and highly competitive contexts were two constants in the lives of these hominin groups. Thus, the criteria determining whether hominins could inhabit a given landscape were most likely related to the presence or absence of resources, such as animal resources, water and raw materials, rather than the dynamics of the carnivore populations, to which the hominins were able to become habituated.},

However, a regional perspective, such as the one employed in this paper, allows us to identify trends and patterns during the Late Holocene (last 2,500 years) that could remain in the shadows if a microregional scale alone were used. Climatic changes occurred during the Late Holocene and specifically during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), ca. 900 BP that were very different from the preceding times. It was proposed that lower lacustrine basins (lowlands) were residentially used by hunter-gatherer populations while the high basaltic plateaus (highlands) show an archaeological signal related to a seasonal logistic strategy. Consequently, it is expected that regional archaeozoological records obtained in different type of basins should follow these archaeological patterns. Spatial distribution of the zooarchaeological record present important differences between the Middle and Late Holocene in terms of skeletal part frequencies and processing evidence that is in agreement with the proposal.},

However, culture-independent techniques report that large numbers of microorganisms coexist in the lung. There are many unknown aspects in the field, but available reports show that the lower respiratory tract microbiota: 1) is similar in healthy subjects to the oropharyngeal microbiota and dominated by members of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla; 2) shows changes in smokers and well-defined differences in chronic respiratory diseases, although the temporal and spatial kinetics of these changes are only partially known; and 3) shows relatively abundant non-cultivable bacteria in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, with specific patterns for each disease. In all of these diseases, a loss of diversity, paralleled by an over-representation of Proteobacteria (dysbiosis), has been related to disease severity and exacerbations. However, it is unknown whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of the damage to bronchoalveolar surfaces.Finally, little is known about bacterial functionality and the interactions between viruses, fungi and bacteria. It is expected that future research in bacterial gene expressions, metagenomics longitudinal analysis and host-microbiome animal models will help to move towards targeted microbiome interventions in respiratory diseases.},

 abstract = { Over the past twenty years, early hominin behavioral models have increasingly abandoned social inferences of the behaviors that created the earliest archaeological record. Behavioral reconstructions have focused mostly on the subsistence strategies that conditioned the selection of specific loci (i.e., central-places) and the manipulation and consumption of resources therein (i.e., raw material transport and use and carcass acquisition and processing). Part of the reason why the social component of these behaviors has been marginalized lies in the lack of proper modern analogs and also in a lack of analytical tools to link social organization to subsistence. Spatial analysis of the debris patterns generated by modern foragers (depending on their social organizations) is a potentially useful tool to understand behavior in the past. The application of statistical spatial analyses to the distribution of stone tools and bones provides an insightful approach to understand socio-economic behavior at any given site, provided a significant part of the archaeological record of a large paleo-surface has been exposed through excavation. This is the case of FLK Zinj and PTK I. A statistical spatial analysis of these sites shows a spatial interdependence between tools and bones. It also shows that the single dense cluster pattern at these sites is not a preservation issue or a sampling artifact, but the result of a socio-economic organization by early humans that differed from those currently documented among H. sapiens foragers.},

 abstract = {UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are some of the most important biophysical and geological places on Earth, yet nearly half are endangered or face considerable risks from ever-expanding human impacts. Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist.},

 abstract = {Lactase persistence-the ability of adults to digest the lactose in milk-varies widely in frequency across human populations. This trait represents an adaptation to the domestication of dairying animals and the subsequent consumption of their milk. Five variants are currently known to underlie this phenotype, which is monogenic in Eurasia but mostly polygenic in Africa. Despite being a textbook example of regulatory convergent evolution and gene-culture coevolution, the story of lactase persistence is far from clear: Why are lactase persistence frequencies low in Central Asian herders but high in some African hunter-gatherers? Why was lactase persistence strongly selected for even though milk processing can reduce the amount of lactose? Are there other factors, outside of an advantage of caloric intake, that contributed to the selective pressure for lactase persistence? It is time to revisit what we know and still do not know about lactase persistence in humans.},

 abstract = {Projectile technology is considered to appear early in the southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA) and the rich and high resolution MSA sequence of Sibudu Cave in KwaZulu-Natal has provided many new insights about the use and hafting of various projectile forms. We present the results of a functional and technological analysis on a series of unpublished serrated bifacial points recently recovered from the basal deposits of Sibudu Cave. These serrated tools, which only find equivalents in the neighbouring site of Umhlatuzana, precede the Still Bay techno-complex and are older than 77 ka BP. Independent residue and use-wear analyses were performed in a phased procedure involving two separate analysts, which allowed the engagement between two separate lines of functional evidence. Thanks to the excellent preservation at Sibudu Cave, a wide range of animal, plant and mineral residues were observed in direct relation with diagnostic wear patterns. The combination of technological, wear and residue evidence allowed us to confirm that the serration was manufactured with bone compressors and that the serrated points were mounted with a composite adhesive as the tips of projectiles used in hunting activities. The suite of technological and functional data pushes back the evidence for the use of pressure flaking during the MSA and highlights the diversity of the technical innovations adopted by southern African MSA populations. We suggest the serrated points from the stratigraphic units Adam to Darya of Sibudu illustrate one important technological adaptation of the southern African MSA and provide another example of the variability of MSA bifacial technologies.},

 abstract = {Abstract Recent genetic studies have established that the KhoeSan populations of southern Africa are distinct from all other African populations and have remained largely isolated during human prehistory until about 2,000 years ago. Dozens of different KhoeSan groups exist, belonging to three different language families, but very little is known about their population history. We examine new genome-wide polymorphism data and whole mitochondrial genomes for more than one hundred South Africans from the ≠Khomani San and Nama populations of the Northern Cape, analyzed in conjunction with 19 additional southern African populations. Our analyses reveal fine-scale population structure in and around the Kalahari Desert. Surprisingly, this structure does not always correspond to linguistic or subsistence categories as previously suggested, but rather reflects the role of geographic barriers and the ecology of the greater Kalahari Basin. Regardless of subsistence strategy, the indigenous Khoe-speaking Nama pastoralists and the N|u-speaking ≠Khomani (formerly hunter-gatherers) share ancestry with other Khoe-speaking forager populations that form a rim around the Kalahari Desert. We reconstruct earlier migration patterns and estimate that the southern Kalahari populations were among the last to experience gene flow from Bantu-speakers, approximately 14 generations ago. We conclude that local adoption of pastoralism, at least by the Nama, appears to have been primarily a cultural process with limited genetic impact from eastern Africa.  Data deposition  Data files are freely available on the Henn Lab website: http://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/    Summary Distinct, spatially organized ancestries demonstrate fine-scale population structure in southern Africa, implying a more complex history of the KhoeSan than previously thought. Southern KhoeSan ancestry in the Nama and ≠Khomani is shared in a rim around the Kalahari Desert. We hypothesize that there was recent migration of pastoralists from East Africa into southern Africa, independent of the Bantu-expansion, but the spread of pastoralism within southern Africa occurred largely by cultural diffusion. },

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota is impacted by host nutrition and health status and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype influenced by metabolic and immune constraints. Previous studies contrasting rural populations in developing countries to urban industrialized ones have shown that industrialization is strongly correlated with patterns in human gut microbiota; however, we know little about the relative contribution of factors such as climate, diet, medicine, hygiene practices, host genetics, and parasitism. Here, we focus on fine-scale comparisons of African rural populations in order to (i) contrast the gut microbiota of populations inhabiting similar environments but having different traditional subsistence modes and either shared or distinct genetic ancestry, and (ii) examine the relationship between gut parasites and bacterial communities. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of Pygmy hunter-gatherers as well as Bantu individuals from both farming and fishing populations in Southwest Cameroon, we found that the gut parasite Entamoeba is significantly correlated with microbiome composition and diversity. We show that across populations, colonization by this protozoa can be predicted with 79% accuracy based on the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, and that several of the taxa most important for distinguishing Entamoeba absence or presence are signature taxa for autoimmune disorders. We also found gut communities to vary significantly with subsistence mode, notably with some taxa previously shown to be enriched in other hunter-gatherers groups (in Tanzania and Peru) also discriminating hunter-gatherers from neighboring farming or fishing populations in Cameroon.},

 abstract = { The Epipaleolithic sequence of the southern Levant (ca. 24,000–11,500 cal. BP) reflects the shift from mobile to sedentary foraging societies, eventually paving the way to nascent villages, domestication and farming. Early and middle Epipaleolithic cultures (locally, the Kebaran and the Geometric Kebaran) generally produce an archaeological signature of mobile foragers, while the late Epipaleolithic Natufian Culture is renowned for the regular and intensified appearance of durable architecture, cemeteries, groundstones and art, joined with a broad-spectrum economy, and therefore indicates a more complex and sedentary society. Epipaleolithic archaeofaunas have been thoroughly investigated to detect shifts in site-occupation intensity, including changes in prey abundances, ungulate culling patterns and carcass processing habits, but carcass transport decisions received less attention. The transition to sedentary living in the Natufian would entail the exploitation of a defined and contracted territory around the site. In this case, central-place foraging theory predicts that ungulates will be hunted in the site's proximity and hence will be carried away in a more complete form, undergoing minimal or no field butchery. Therefore, we predict that skeletal-element profiles in sedentary Natufian hamlets will be more complete than in pre-Natufian camps, used by mobile foragers. We test this prediction by constructing detailed skeletal-element profiles and examining skeletal-element evenness. The results indicate that ungulate carcasses were transported significantly more completely in the Natufian assemblages, supporting our prediction. We further zoom in to explore the differential distribution of skeletal element abundances within a Natufian hamlet, showing the discard and attrition patterns that eventually produced our skeletal-element record. The results of our analysis of skeletal-element evenness correspond to other archaeological proxies for increased site-occupation intensity and territorial contraction in the Natufian.},

 abstract = {In the last few years, the study of cut marks on bone surfaces has become fundamental for the interpretation of prehistoric butchery practices. Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife. The quantitative and qualitative information registered is analysed by means of standard multivariate statistics and geometric morphometrics to assess the similarities and differences obtained with the different methodologies.},

Direct dating of <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils from the Dinaledi Chamber (Berger et al., 2015) shows that they were deposited between about 236 ka and 335 ka (Dirks et al., 2017), placing <i>H. naledi</i> in the later Middle Pleistocene. Hawks and colleagues (Hawks et al., 2017) report the discovery of a second chamber within the Rising Star system (Dirks et al., 2015) that contains <i>H. naledi</i> remains. Previously, only large-brained modern humans or their close relatives had been demonstrated to exist at this late time in Africa, but the fossil evidence for any hominins in subequatorial Africa was very sparse. It is now evident that a diversity of hominin lineages existed in this region, with some divergent lineages contributing DNA to living humans and at least <i>H. naledi</i> representing a survivor from the earliest stages of diversification within <i>Homo</i>. The existence of a diverse array of hominins in subequatorial comports with our present knowledge of diversity across other savanna-adapted species, as well as with palaeoclimate and paleoenvironmental data. <i>H. naledi</i> casts the fossil and archaeological records into a new light, as we cannot exclude that this lineage was responsible for the production of Acheulean or Middle Stone Age tool industries.},

 abstract = {The foraging behaviors of Middle Stone Age (MSA) early modern humans have largely been based on evidence from well-stratified cave sites in South Africa. Whereas these sites have provided an abundance of data for behavioral reconstruction that are unmatched elsewhere in Africa, they are unlikely to preserve evidence of the diversity of foraging strategies employed by MSA hunters who lived in a variety of ecological and landscape settings across the African continent. Here we describe the results of recent excavations at the open-air site of Bovid Hill at Wakondo, Rusinga Island, Kenya, which yielded 24 in situ MSA artifacts within an assemblage of bones comprised exclusively of the extinct alcelaphin bovid Rusingoryx atopocranion. The excavated faunal assemblage is characterized by a prime-age-dominated mortality profile and includes cut-marked specimens and an associated MSA Levallois blade-based artifact industry recovered from a channel deposit dated to 68 ± 5 ka by optically stimulated luminescence. Taphonomic, geologic, and faunal evidence points to mass exploitation of Rusingoryx by humans at Bovid Hill, which likely represents an initial processing site that was altered post-depositionally by fluvial processes. This site highlights the importance of rivers and streams for mass procurement in an open and seasonal landscape, and provides important new insights into MSA behavioral variability with respect to environmental conditions, site function, and tactical foraging strategies in eastern Africa. Bovid Hill thus joins a growing number of MSA and Middle Paleolithic localities that are suggestive of tactical hunting behaviors and mass capture of gregarious ungulate prey.},

In this study, we compare the recently excavated fauna from the SB layers at Blombos Cave (BBC) with that from the HP levels at Klipdrift Shelter (KDS) in the southern Cape of South Africa. We consider our findings in the framework of recent models for early human subsistence behavior. In particular, we link our study with models involving resource intensification to examine whether foraging strategies in the HP were more or less intensive than those in the SB. Based on our criteria used to assess intensification-the exploitation of low-ranked prey, the processing of low-utility elements, transport decisions, and occupational intensity-intensive subsistence strategies are more evident at KDS than BBC. Our results suggest that low-ranked elements were processed more heavily and diet breath was broader at KDS than at BBC. However, foraging ranges may have been more extensive at BBC than at KDS. Taphonomic data also suggests that the SB at BBC was a low-intensity, sporadically occupied period in contrast to the high-intensity occupations during the HP at KDS. We argue that this may be related to differences in mobility and residential patterns between these techno-complexes.},

 abstract = {The mammalian gut microbiome plays a profound role in the physiology, metabolism, and overall health of its host. However, biologists have only a nascent understanding of the forces that drive inter-individual heterogeneity in gut microbial composition, especially the role of host social environment. Here we used 178 samples from 78 wild yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) living in two social groups to test how host social context, including group living, social interactions within groups, and transfer between social groups (e.g., dispersal) predict inter-individual variation in gut microbial alpha and beta diversity. We also tested whether social effects differed for prevalent "core" gut microbial taxa, which are thought to provide primary functions to hosts, versus rare "non-core" microbes, which may represent relatively transient environmental acquisitions. Confirming prior studies, we found that each social group harbored a distinct gut microbial community. These differences included both non-core and core gut microbial taxa, suggesting that these effects are not solely driven by recent gut microbial exposures. Within social groups, close grooming partners had more similar core microbiomes, but not non-core microbiomes, than individuals who rarely groomed each other, even controlling for kinship and diet similarity between grooming partners. Finally, in support of the idea that the gut microbiome can be altered by current social context, we found that the longer an immigrant male had lived in a given social group, the more closely his gut microbiome resembled the gut microbiomes of the group's long-term residents. Together, these results reveal the importance of a host's social context in shaping the gut microbiome and shed new light onto the microbiome-related consequences of male dispersal.},

 abstract = {A method is presented for removing recent homoplastic events from a phylogenetic tree. This "topiary pruning" method produces a series of progressively modified duplicates of the original set of data, from which more and more of the most recent substitutions have been removed. The edited sets of data have increased amounts of information per remaining taxon, while similar but randomized data sets subjected to topiary pruning do not. The ability of topiary pruning to "unscramble" artificial data sets that have high levels of homoplasy is demonstrated, and is shown to be similar in its effects to the weighting method of Kluge and Farris (1969), although with the additional advantage of reducing the number of taxa to the point where bootstrapping is feasible. Pruning and weighting used together produce closer approximations to the "true" tree than either method used separately. It is further shown that in these artificial data sets midpoint rooting is more likely to be accurate than outgroup rooting. When pruning and weighting are applied to the extensive sets of mitochondrial DNA data of Cann et al. (1987) and Vigilant et al. (1991), trees result that have deep branch points, some of which lead to entirely African branches. In the case of the Vigilant et al. data, the three African branches have bootstrap values between 0.94 and 1.0, and the consensus and bootstrap midpoint roots also have high bootstrap values and occur on these African branches near their junction. An African origin of the human mitochondrial tree is not proved by this approach, particularly since sequences from non-African groups are underrepresented in current data sets, but it is rendered more likely.},

 abstract = {Abstract An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.},

However, the existence of several possible accumulating agents, together with the effect of bone attrition, is known to introduce a potential bias, thus hindering the possibilities of meaningful concussions. In order to overcome this problem, several methods were proposed during the late 90s and early 2000’s, although a consensus was not reached, mainly because the different approaches were based on a certain initial hypothesis that significantly affected the output. Building on that previous experience, a new methodological framework is proposed and compared here. Moving from rather deterministic techniques, a Bayesian alternative approach based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling is presented and applied to several ethnographic and Pleistocene key sites. This new method makes use of the available information to constrain the possible degrees of attrition and carcass processing strategies, leading to easily comparable results.},

 abstract = {Microbial communities thrive in a number of environments. Exploration of their microbiomes - their global genome - may reveal metabolic features that contribute to the development and welfare of their hosts, or chemical cleansing of environments. Yet we often lack final demonstration of their causal role in features of interest. The reason is that we do not have proper baselines that we could use to monitor how microbiota cope with key metabolites in the hosting environment. Here, focusing on animal gut microbiota, we describe the fate of cobalamins - metabolites of the B12 coenzyme family - that are essential for animals but synthesized only by prokaryotes. Microbiota produce the vitamin used in a variety of animals (and in algae). Coprophagy plays a role in its management. For coprophobic man, preliminary observations suggest that the gut microbial production of vitamin B12 plays only a limited role. By contrast, the vitamin is key for structuring microbiota. This implies that it is freely available in the environment. This can only result from lysis of the microbes that make it. A consequence for biotechnology applications is that, if valuable for their host, B12-producing microbes should be sensitive to bacteriophages and colicins, or make spores.},

 abstract = {The introduction of DNA fingerprinting to forensic science rapidly expanded the available evidence that could be garnered from a crime scene and used in court cases. Next generation sequencing technologies increased available genetic data that could be used as evidence by orders of magnitude, and as such, significant additional genetic information is now available for use in forensic science. This includes DNA from the bacteria that live in and on humans, known as the human microbiome. Next generation sequencing of the human microbiome demonstrates that its bacterial DNA can be used to uniquely identify an individual, provide information about their life and behavioral patterns, determine the body site where a sample came from, and estimate postmortem intervals. Bacterial samples from the environment and objects can also be leveraged to address similar questions about the individual(s) who interacted with them. However, the applications of this new field in forensic sciences raises concerns on current methods used in sample processing, including sample collection, storage, and the statistical power of published studies. These areas of human microbiome research need to be fully addressed before microbiome data can become a regularly incorporated evidence type and routine procedure of the forensic toolkit. Here, we summarize information on the current status of microbiome research as applies to the forensic field, the mathematical models used to make predictions, and the possible legal and practical difficulties that can limit the application of microbiomes in forensic science.},

 abstract = {Interspecific communication is an exceptionally broad term, encompassing everything from, for example, symbolic communication between humans and nonhuman animals (see Chapter 32, this volume) to interactions between fungi and bacteria (e.g., Hogan & Kolter, 2006). A more manageable definition for this chapter involves limiting discussion to various forms of information transfer between humans and their companion animals, between humans and their working animals, and between many species of nonhuman animals that depend on other species, sometimes mutually, for various forms of information that are critical to survival, or at least improve their chances of it. Some of these interactions are discussed in detail in other chapters (e.g., see Chapters 30, 34, and 42, this volume) and are mentioned only briefly here. Granted, emphasizing information transfer ignores many other forms of mutualism in which some type of communication must exist (e.g., ant–aphid interactions; see Endo & Itino, 2012), but such a decision allows a more extensive discussion of the chosen topics.

 abstract = {The hygiene hypothesis proposes that within high‐income, economically developed nations, such as the United States, the increasingly widespread lack of exposure during early life to a variety of environmental microorganisms predisposes humans to chronic inflammatory disorders (CIDs) in adulthood. This chapter demonstrates how human host‐pathogen interactions can be directly applied to improve human health in the present, through clinical treatments and public health interventions. It also demonstrates how epidemiologic transition theory placed within an evolutionary context, specifically that of the second epidemiologic transition and the hygiene hypothesis, can be used to beneficially inform practice in clinical medicine and public health. The chapter pivots around the question: why are chronic inflammatory diseases (CID), like asthma, allergy, and autoimmune diseases, at high and increasing incidence in high‐income, developed nations. The severity of CIDs, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), may be lessened by reintroducing "dirt" into our lives in the form of parasites, specifically helminths.},

@article{pub.1087306055,
 abstract = {Atkinson (2011) shows that phoneme inventories are largest in Africa and smaller elsewhere, and suggests that this clinal distribution reflects a serial founder effect of human migrations out of Africa. Because of the way in which velaric ingressive and pulmonic egressive airstream mechanisms combine to create extra-large consonant inventories, click languages have the largest phoneme inventories of all. Critics question why phoneme inventory size, but not other properties of language, should leave a trace of the origin and dispersal of natural language. This article argues that the first modern human languages would likely have had very large phoneme inventories if we assume, following Hockett’s work (1960), that duality of patterning was the last ‘design feature’ of language to emerge. The diachronic trajectories of sign languages and writing systems illustrate that dually patterned phonologies are often preceded by a stage in which minimal units of form map directly onto semantic functions. Following Hjelmslev (1961), I label such linguistic systems, ‘monoplanar’. The article critiques language origins theories that have claimed that click consonants were sounds employed in the development of human speech because of their putatively iconic or sound symbolic properties. Focusing on the structural effects of velaric ingressives for phoneme inventory size, I argue that clicks would have been essential in elaborating large inventories, and thus large vocabularies, in monoplanar spoken languages not because of any inherently iconic properties, but because of their capacity to multiply phonemic distinctions by combining with accompaniments produced via the pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism. The contemporary distribution of phonemic clicks offers support for the hypothesis, as genetic studies increasingly point to an Eastern or Southern African origin for modern humans, while phonemic clicks have an areal but non-genetically restricted distribution in overlapping vicinities.},

The present volume is a contribution to the elaboration and development of the newly emerging discipline of economic anthropology. The contributions within this volume examine which concepts from other interdisciplinary and related fields can help to establish a more concrete image of human kind in the economic sphere. By inquiring who economic actors truly are, this anthropological reflection on the economy goes above and beyond ethical dimensions.

Most of the indigenous species of food plants in the tropical regions, which have been utilized by native peoples since ancient times, were pushed aside during the colonial era when consumer demands in Europe largely determined the cultivation and research priorities of indigenous or traditional crop plants. Cultivated crop plants include plants which are under regular or limited cultivation. The major drawback in the nutritional exploitation of tropical plant seeds is the lack of information on their nutrient and antinutrient composition. Some of the well‐known natural contaminants variously reported and present inmost of these tropical plant seeds includes, protease inhibitors, lectins, phenolic compounds, oxalate, cyanogenic glycosides, phytate alkaloids, nitrates/nitrites, goitrogens 3,4‐dihydroxy‐l‐phenylalanine in Mucuna.},

 abstract = {Bone refits can be a useful tool to understand the archaeological assemblages. From a taphonomic point of view, they have been used to reinforce some aspects related to the formation processes of the sites. However, they can be used to check some palaeoeconomic and social interpretations of the assemblages as well, providing accurate temporal relationships between the objects. For all these reasons, bone refits are relevant to study the settlement dynamics and the intra-site behaviour of past human groups. The main aim of this work is to present the faunal refits data obtained from two different archaeological assemblages (M and O) of the Abric Romaní site (Capellades, Spain), dated around 55 ka. The study also includes taxonomic, anatomical, taphonomic and spatial analyses. The spatio-temporal proxy allows us to interpret the activities carried out by the Neanderthal groups in different areas during different moments. From here, it is possible to interpret site structure, using ethnoarchaeological data as a referent. The comparison between these two archaeological layers, and between them and other assemblages, both from Abric Romaní and from other sites, can contribute significantly to the knowledge of the intra-site behaviour and settlement patterns at the end of the Middle Palaeolithic.},

Accelerator mass spectrometry has made radiocarbon dating the most precise method to determine the death of living organisms that occurred within the last 50,000 years. However, the method is not without limitations and this review article provides Africanist archaeologists with cautionary insights as to when, where, and how to utilize radiocarbon dates. Specifically, the review will concentrate on the potential of carbon reservoirs and recycled organic remains to inflate apparent age estimates, diagenesis of carbon isotopes in variable pH ecologies, and hot-humid climates and non-climate-controlled archives that can compromise the efficacy of samples. Legacy radiocarbon ages must be critically examined for what method was used to generate the age, and calibration radiocarbon ages from critical periods of African prehistory lack precision to resolve significant debates. A multipronged dating strategy and careful selection of radiocarbon sample materials are advocated from the earliest stages of research design.},

 abstract = {Hummingbirds and nectar bats coevolved with the plants they visit to feed on floral nectars rich in sugars. The extremely high metabolic costs imposed by small size and hovering flight in combination with reliance upon sugars as their main source of dietary calories resulted in convergent evolution of a suite of structural and functional traits. These allow high rates of aerobic energy metabolism in the flight muscles, fueled almost entirely by the oxidation of dietary sugars, during flight. High intestinal sucrase activities enable high rates of sucrose hydrolysis. Intestinal absorption of glucose and fructose occurs mainly through a paracellular pathway. In the fasted state, energy metabolism during flight relies on the oxidation of fat synthesized from previously-ingested sugar. During repeated bouts of hover-feeding, the enhanced digestive capacities, in combination with high capacities for sugar transport and oxidation in the flight muscles, allow the operation of the "sugar oxidation cascade", the pathway by which dietary sugars are directly oxidized by flight muscles during exercise. It is suggested that the potentially harmful effects of nectar diets are prevented by locomotory exercise, just as in human hunter-gatherers who consume large quantities of honey.},

 abstract = {The Ultimatum Game is a paradigmatic two-player game. A proposer can offer a certain fraction of some valuable good. A responder can accept the offer or reject it, implying that the two players receive nothing. The only subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is to only offer an infinitesimal amount and to accept this. However, this equilibrium is not in agreement with experimental observations, which show varying accepted offers around 40%. While some authors suggest that the fairest split of 50% vs. 50% would be explainable on theoretical grounds or by computer simulation, a few authors (including myself) have recently suggested that the Golden Ratio, about 0.618 vs. about 0.382, would be the solution, in striking agreement with observations. Here we propose a solution concept, based on an optimality approach and epistemic arguments, leading to that suggested solution. The optimality principle is explained both in an axiomatic way and by bargaining arguments, and the relation to Fibonacci numbers is outlined. Our presentation complements the Economic Harmony theory proposed by R. Suleiman and is based on infinite continued fractions. The results are likely to be important for the theory of fair salaries, justice theory and the predictive value of game theory.},

 abstract = {Tropical forests have been an important human habitat and played a significant role in early human dispersal and evolution. Likewise, the use of fire, besides being one of the exceptional characteristics of humans, serves as a marker for human evolution. While the use of fire by prehistoric hunter-gatherers is relatively well documented in arid and temperate environments, the archaeological evidence in humid tropical environment is to date very limited. We first review the archaeological evidence for hunter-gatherer use of fire in humid tropical environments and suggest that better understanding of formation processes is required. We present a geo-ethnoarchaeological study from South India, involving ethnography, excavations and laboratory-based analyses in order to build a new framework to study fire residues in humid tropical forests associated with hunter-gatherer's use of fire. Ethnographic observations point to a dynamic and ephemeral use of hearths. Hearths location were dictated by the social and ever-changing social dynamics of the site. The hearths deposited small amount of residues which were later swept on a daily basis, re-depositing ash and charcoal in waste areas and leaving only a microscopic signal in the original location. Particular acidic conditions and intensive biological activity within tropical sediments result in the complete dissolution of ash and bones while favouring the preservation of charcoal and phytoliths. Consequently, the identification of fire residues in humid tropical forests and the reconstruction of the human use of fire must involve multi-proxy microscopic analysis to detect its micro-signatures.},

 abstract = {The well-established negative health outcomes of sleep deprivation, and the suggestion that availability of electricity may enable later bed times without compensating sleep extension in the morning, have stimulated interest in studying communities whose sleep pattern may resemble a pre-industrial state. Here, we describe sleep and activity in two neighbouring communities, one urban (Milange) and one rural (Tengua), in a region of Mozambique where urbanisation is an ongoing process. The two communities differ in the amount and timing of daily activity and of light exposure, with later bedtimes (≈1 h) associated with more evening and less daytime light exposure seen in the town of Milange. In contrast to previous reports comparing communities with and without electricity, sleep duration did not differ between Milange (7.28 h) and Tengua (7.23 h). Notably, calculated sleep quality was significantly poorer in rural Tengua than in Milange, and poor sleep quality was associated with a number of attributes more characteristic of rural areas, including more intense physical labour and less comfortable sleeping arrangements. Thus, whilst our data support the hypothesis that access to electricity delays sleep timing, the higher sleep quality in the urban population also suggests that some aspects of industrialisation are beneficial to sleep.},

 abstract = { This article discusses new data on the initial peopling of Central Western Patagonia based on research conducted at the Cueva de la Vieja site (45°16′27″ S; 71°32′24″ W, 718 masl), contextualizing this event it in the broader Pleistocene human dispersal of southernmost South America. Archaeological excavations and analyses at this cave site were undertaken to address the chronology of the initial settlement of the region, characteristics of the first human presence and subsequent site redundancy. This paper includes a description of the site context based on macro- and microscopic stratigraphy of the excavated section, the characterization of anthropogenic features and a comprehensive radiocarbon-dating program. Archaeological assemblages (i.e., lithics, bones and charred seeds) are used to explain the variations in the human occupation of this venue, with particular emphasis on the earliest materials and occupational surfaces as well as post-depositional processes. The occupation events at Cueva de la Vieja span the last 12,000 calibrated years and indicate, at this point, the earliest securely dated human presence in Central-Western Patagonia, at least one millennium after other thoroughly-dated sites toward the east. This suggests that the initial settlers must have occupied the eastern flank of the Andes at this latitude only after glaciers and other glaciogenetic features retreated and viable ecosystems emerged.},

We are now beginning to understand the microbiota-host co-regulated pathways underlying these processes, paving the way for a new era of rational piloting of the gut microbiome functions, through the design of a new generation of microbiome-targeting drugs. Microbiota-derived metabolites are emerging as promising starting hit compounds to modulate human targets, hence triggering certain pharmacological responses. In conclusion, drug discovery targeting the gut microbiota as well as the characterization of microbiota-derived metabolites can represent innovative medicinal chemistry possibilities toward the identification of novel drug candidates, targets, and more in general innovative ways for the treatment of unmet medical needs.},

 abstract = {Zooarchaeological assemblages in a variety of geographic and temporal contexts are dominated by fragmentary long bone specimens, and precise identification of side, skeletal element, and bone portion underlie archaeological interpretations, including specimen counts for skeletal part profiles, minimum number of element (MNE), and individual (MNI) estimates. Actualistic hammerstone and anvil breakage of domestic goat limb bones was used to document how fragmentation impacts precise identification of skeletal specimens, analysis of assemblage composition, and reconstructions of butchery behavior. Specimens greater than 2-cm in size were assigned to categories that describe the precision with which side, element, upper, intermediate and lower limb segment, and long bone portion could be identified. Results suggest that specimen size is positively related to identifiability, and more identifiable specimens tend to include epiphyses and relatively complete shaft circumferences. Most elements produced a similar number of fragments, including highly identifiable ends that yield accurate skeletal part profiles, MNE, and MNI estimates. However, if density-mediated destruction removes these specimens, analysis of less-identifiable shaft fragments significantly underrepresents element and individual abundance. The number of identified limb specimens (NISP), MNE, and epiphysis-to-shaft ratios in fragmentary archaeological butchery assemblages suggest limb end underrepresentation deflates measures of assemblage abundance and reduces the behavioral resolution of butchery interpretations. However, zooarchaeological analyses can productively incorporate fragmentary, less-identifiable specimens when they define hypotheses that match the scale of archaeological data.},

Concotto fragments are found throughout the Italian peninsula and date from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. Current studies express contradictory opinions about whether or not the Concottos on living surfaces represent intentionally constructed surfaces or the secondary products of the contact between hot embers and sediments. This study uses micromorphological analysis to investigate the function and composition of Concotto surfaces from several domestic structures at the Early Bronze Age village of Afragola in southern Italy. Afragola is an exceptionally preserved agricultural village that was covered by almost 1 m of volcanic ash during the Vesuvius eruption in 3945 ± 10 cal. BP. The Concottos at Afragola are hard, red surfaces that are typically associated with burned materials. Micromorphological analysis reveals that the Concottos were intentionally made by laying down patches of clay and then heating them to create a hard, flat surface. This study explores the potential uses of the Concotto as cooking surfaces during the Early Bronze Age of southern Italy.},

Here, we compared the laterality of a simple task (grooming) and a complex task (tool use) to investigate whether increasing task difficulty elicited individual hand preference among a group of captive bonobos (Pan paniscus). Subjects were 17 bonobos housed at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Laterality of grooming was recorded using group scans; tool use was recorded using all-occurrence sampling. Grooming was characterized as unimanual or bimanual, and both tasks were scored as right-handed or left-handed. Most individuals did not exhibit significant hand preference for unimanual or bimanual (asymmetrical hand use) grooming, although 1 individual was lateralized for each. For the 8 subjects who engaged in termite fishing enough for statistical testing, 7 individuals exhibited significant laterality and strong individual hand preference. Four subjects preferred their left hand, 3 preferred their right, and 1 had no preference. Grooming, a simple behavior, was not lateralized in this group, yet a more complex behavior revealed a strong individual hand preference, and these results are congruent with other recent findings that demonstrate complex tasks elicit hand preference in bonobos.},

 abstract = {Compared to great apes, humans maintain a relatively rapid reproductive pace despite long periods of dependency. This seemingly contradictory set of traits is made possible by weaning offspring before nutritional independence and alloparents who help provide care. In traditional societies, this help may be provided to mothers in part by their juvenile offspring who carry, supervise, or provision younger siblings. In contrast to humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are nutritionally independent after weaning, yet juveniles continue to travel with their mother and younger sibling for an additional 4-5 years. This continued association could be costly to the mother if she continues to invest in weaned offspring. Alternately, while juvenile chimpanzees do not typically provision younger siblings, their presence and social interaction with infants may allow mothers to focus on other tasks. In this study, we investigate the costs and benefits to mothers of continued association with juveniles in wild chimpanzees. Using 26 years of long-term behavioral data we examined how maternal activity budgets varied based on the presence of a dependent juvenile offspring. We found that continued social interaction between mothers and juveniles does not influence the mother's time allocated to interacting with the younger infant, her feeding, resting, or travel time, or time socializing with other community members. Instead, mothers may benefit from the additional social interaction and/or relationship with their older offspring. Using 45 years of demographic data we found that those offspring who had an older sibling tended to be more likely to survive each year from birth to 8 years than those without an older sibling. Additionally, interbirth intervals were more likely to end when the female had an older offspring present. A mutually beneficial mother-juvenile dynamic in great apes provides insight into continued association between mothers and offspring after nutritional independence and the emergence of juvenile helping during hominin evolution.},

Our analyses leverage the taxa-sample duality in the data to show how the gut microbiota recovers following this perturbation. Through a holistic approach that integrates phylogenetic, metagenomic and abundance information, we elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals.

                  The paper describes the story of discovering South African rock art as an inspiration for research in completely different part of the globe, namely in Central Asia and Siberia. It refers to those aspect of African research which proved to importantly develop the understanding of rock art in Asia. Several aspects are addressed. First, it points to importance of rethinking of relationship between art, myth and ethnography, which in South Africa additionally resulted in reconsidering the ontology of rock images and the very idea of reading of rock art. From the latter viewpoint particularly inspiring appeared the idea of three-dimensionality of rock art ‘text’. The second issue of South African ‘origin,’ which notably inspired research all over the world, concerns a new theorizing of shamanism. The paper then discusses how and to what extent this new theory add to the research on the rock art in Siberia and Central Asia.},

 abstract = {Previous zooarchaeological analysis at Koobi Fora indicates that Okote Member hominins were the primary agents of bone assemblage formation, gained early access to large and small mammal flesh, and consumed both high- and low-ranked carcass parts. The discovery of additional butchered specimens prompted the re-analysis presented here of three large and well-preserved zooarchaeological assemblages from the Okote member, GaJi14, FwJj14N and FwJj14S, to revisit paleoecological hypotheses about tool-assisted carnivory. Cow and goat limb butchery documenting the skeletal location of cut marks created by skinning, defleshing, and disarticulation was used to build an actualistic model to infer hominin consumption of distinct carcass resources. Archaeological specimens were assigned to early (defleshing limbs), middle (defleshing ribs, viscera, vertebrae, and head) and late (metapodial tendon removal, element disarticulation, long bone fragmentation) carcass consumption stages, and the incidence of these butchery behaviors was examined for specimens and minimum number of element and individual aggregates. Elbow specimens, where traces of defleshing, disarticulation, and percussion co-occur, offer a sequential view of carcass consumption behaviors that is free from fragmentation bias. Classification trees populated with actualistic data were used to identify defleshing and disarticulation cut mark clusters on archaeological elbow portions by their location, cut mark count, median length, and median cross-sectional width. Actualistically-informed configurational analysis offers high-resolution behavioral reconstruction of the butchered sub-assemblage and should be integrated with assemblage-scale zooarchaeological methods. These experiments highlight the bias for detecting butchery traces of early carcass access, because defleshing cut marks are abundant and introduced to dense midshaft portions, whereas disarticulation cut marks are rare and occur on epiphyseal portions, which are often deleted by density-mediated destruction. Butchery trace interpretation across multiple analytical scales confirms a flexible carnivorous paleoecological role for Okote hominins that included primary and secondary access to carcass resources from large and small mammals.},

 abstract = {The evolutionary origins of the human bias for 85% right-handedness are obscure. The Apprenticeship Complexity Theory states that the increasing difficulty of acquiring stone tool-making and other manual skills in the Pleistocene favoured learners whose hand preference matched that of their teachers. Furthermore, learning from a viewing position opposite, rather than beside, the demonstrator might be harder because it requires more mental transformation. We varied handedness and viewpoint in a bimanual learning task. Thirty-two participants reproduced folding asymmetric origami figures as demonstrated by a videotaped teacher in four conditions (left-handed teacher opposite the learner, left-handed beside, right-handed opposite, or right-handed beside). Learning performance was measured by time to complete each figure, number of video pauses and rewinds, and similarity of copies to the target shape. There was no effect of handedness or viewpoint on imitation learning. However, participants preferred to produce figures with the same asymmetry as demonstrated, indicating they imitate the teacher's hand preference. We speculate that learning by imitation involves internalising motor representations and that, to facilitate learning by imitation, many motor actions can be flexibly executed using the demonstrated hand configuration. We conclude that matching hand preferences evolved due to socially learning moderately complex bimanual skills.},

The confirmed truth of religion or al-ma'lum min al-din bi-durahurah requires one to accept it with submission. --- Menurut Al-Ghazaly, kebenaran harus dilihat dan diletakkan dalam kerangka keyakinan dan kepastian, mulai dari wujud indrawy, wujud khayaly, hingga keyakinan yang tidak akan dapat dipengaruhi oleh faktor apapun. Karena itu pula, ia mengklafisikan manusia pada katagori awam dan khawas. Ini dimaksudkan agar seseorang tidak merta melakukan generalisasi dan memastikan bahwa seseorang telah melakukan kesalahan. Tulisan ini akan mengkaji sesungguhnya apa teori kebenaran dalam pemikiran hukum Al-Ghazaly dan bagaimana teori tersebut dibangun secara epistemologis. Tujuannya, untuk megetahui tentang teori kebenaran dan bagaimana metodologi yang dikembangkannya tersebut. Penelitian ini menemukan, bahwa menurut Al-Ghazaly, kebenaran dalam pemikiran hukum, harus dilihat dan diletakkan dalam kerangka keyakinan dan kepastian. Kebenaran yang telah dipastikan dari agama atau al-ma'lum min al-din bi-dlarurah menuntut seseorang wajib menerimanya dengan ketundukan.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Northern Dispersal Route (NDR) and Southern Dispersal Route (SDR) are hypothesized to have been used by modern humans in the dispersal out of Africa. The NDR follows the Nile into Northeast Africa and crosses the Red Sea into the Levant. The SDR emerges from the Horn of Africa and crosses the Bab el-Mandeb into southern Arabia. In this study, we analyze genetic data from populations living along the NDR and SDR to test support for each dispersal route.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 90 Yemeni samples on the Affymetrix Human Origins array. We analyzed these data with published data from Levantine and other southern Arabian populations as well as 157 comparative populations for a total sample size of &gt;550,000 genetic variants from &gt;2,000 individuals in &gt;160 populations. We calculated outgroup f<sub>3</sub> statistics to test how Levantine and southern Arabian populations relate to African populations living along the NDR and SDR and to other non-African populations.
RESULTS: We find that Levantine and southern Arabian populations bear similar genetic relationships to both African and non-African populations, thus providing no support for the use of one dispersal route over the other.
DISCUSSION: Our results are consistent with a history of gene flow between the Levant and southern Arabia. Consideration of genetic, archaeological, and paleoclimate data provide a slight edge for the SDR but, ultimately, more data are needed to definitively identify which dispersal route out of Africa was used.},

The results of these experiments indicate that an individual’s life history experience with volunteering, coupled with level of trust in the community, provides the strongest solicitation effects. We find that characteristics of the individual being solicited interact with particular social cues of the solicitor. The social cues we use are derived from prominent theories of helping behavior, corroborated with the ethnographic record.

 abstract = {What determines how languages categorize colors? We analyzed results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about. We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color usefulness.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Hominin procedures for fire-starting, sharpening rocks, and softening roots by pounding or chopping require sustained attention for hours; shade is sought in the brush fringe bordering a grassland. Clustering these more versatile adults, while others are away hunting and gathering, provides a setup for assortative mating. This can lengthen attention span, enhance versatility and, with it, brain size. The rate of enlargement is accelerated by a boom-and-bust cycle in their meat supply, predicting the observed initiation of enlargement at −2.3 myr in the Rift Valley once boom-prone grazers evolved from the mixed feeders. Several months after lightning created a burn scar back in the brush, the new grassland enables a population boom for those grazers that discover it. Several decades later as brush regrows, they are pushed back. Their hominin followers, wicked in from the grassland’s shady fringe, boom together with the burn-scar grazers. They then follow their meat supply back to the main population. This creates an amplifying feedback loop, shifting Homo gene frequencies centrally. Brush fires are so frequent that the cosmic ray mutation rate becomes enlargement’s rate-limiter, consistent with 460 cm 3 /myr remaining constant during many climate shifts. The apparent tripling of enlargement rate in the last 0.2 myr vanished when the non-ancestors were omitted. Asian Homo erectus enlargement lags the ancestral trend line by 0.5 myr. Neanderthals lag somewhat less but have a late size spurt after the −70 kyr Homo sapiens Out of Africa, suggesting enlargement genes were acquired via interbreeding. },

 abstract = {Practical reasoning, reasoning about what actions should be chosen, is highly dependent both on the individual values of the agent concerned and on what others choose to do. Hitherto, computational models of value-based argumentation for practical reasoning have required assumptions to be made about the beliefs and preferences of other agents. Here we present a new method for taking the actions of others into account that does not require these assumptions: the only beliefs and preferences considered are those of the agent engaged in the reasoning. Our new formalism draws on utility-based approaches and expresses the reasoning in the form of arguments and objections, to enable full integration with value-based practical reasoning. We illustrate our approach by showing how value-based reasoning is modelled in two scenarios used in experimental economics, the Ultimatum Game and the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we present an evaluation of our approach in terms of these experiments. The evaluation demonstrates that our model is able to reproduce computationally the results of ethnographic experiments, serving as an encouraging validation exercise.},

 abstract = {Ethological studies have shown that besides human groups, large-medium carnivores have bone-collecting habits. The research developed since the last half of the twentieth century has attempted to characterise the carnivore’s accumulations and to identify them in the archaeo-paleontological record. At present, we have diagnostic criteria that define the accumulations produced by hyenids (mainly, Crocuta crocuta), thereby allowing us to differentiate them from the other accumulating agents. The faunal assemblage recovered at the Early Pleistocene TD6.3 layer of the Gran Dolina site is characterised by the presence of typical elements described in hyena dens: presence of small carnivores remains, high bone breakage, low epiphysis survival and a high frequency (>30%) of specimens with carnivore induced modifications, including large amounts of digested bones. However, attritional mortality profiles, hyena’s cubs remains, mid-shaft bone cylinders or differential anatomical composition among different weight-sizes, have not been observed or are ambiguous. In addition, anthropic evidences are scarce and concentrated in the uppermost section of the layer. TD6.3 is the result of an accumulation produced by hyenas using the cave as a den, in alternation with sporadic occupations by hominin groups. TD6.3 shows that hyena fossil accumulations may present great anatomical and taxonomic variability.},

 abstract = {In many species the capacity to accurately differentiate the energy density (kcal/g) of foods is critical because it greatly improves efficiency in foraging. In modern humans this ability remains intact and is expressed in a selective preference for types of fruit and vegetables that contain more calories. However, humans evolved consuming these low energy-dense foods (typically < 1.75 kcal/g) and it remains unclear whether they can also discriminate more energy-dense foods that now feature in modern Western diets. In two experiment participants (both N = 40) completed four tasks that assessed the 'value' of different sets of 22 foods that ranged in energy density (0.1 kcal/g-5.3 kcal/g and range 0.1 kcal/g to 6.2 kcal/g in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively). In Experiment 1 three measures (expected fullness, calorie estimation, and food choice), and in foods less than approximately 1.5 kcal/g (typically fruits and vegetables), the relationship between perceived value and energy density is linear. Above this, we observed clear compressive functions, indicating relative and progressive undervaluation of higher energy-dense foods. The fourth task (rated liking) failed to provide evidence for any relationship with energy density. In Experiment 2 the same pattern was replicated in measures of expected fullness, and in two different assessments of subjective calorie content. Consistent with the concept of 'evolutionary discordance,' this work indicates that modern human physiology is poorly adapted to evaluate foods that have a historically unusual (high) energy density. This has implications both for our understanding of how 'modern' energy-dense foods affect choice and energy intake, and for strategies aimed at removing calories from highly energy-rich foods.},

Pech de l’Azé IV is part of a complex of Lower and Middle Paleolithic cave sites in the Dordogne Valley of southwestern France. Although this region is well known for its rich concentration of Paleolithic sites since the mid-19th century and many of the sites have been repeatedly excavated, no detailed studies have fully documented the stone tool technology and faunal remains or the changes in them over time. The site was regularly occupied by groups of Neanderthals from approximately 100,000 to 40,000 years ago, during which time global-scale changes transformed the region from a relatively warm climate (similar to today’s) to a very cold, glacial one. The site provides valuable insights into changes in Neanderthal behavior that reflect, at least in part, their adaptation to changes in the environment and the availability of important resources, such as prey species.},

 abstract = {The current study provides the first zooarchaeological account of systematically excavated faunal material from Elandsfontein, South Africa (ca. 1.0–0.6Ma). Archaeological assemblages of this age typically lack well-preserved faunal remains recovered in primary association with artifacts, and thus studies have primarily focused on lithic technology. The sizeable faunal sample from Elandsfontein, South Africa is a rare exception and has dramatically influenced the way that we interpret early hominin foraging behavior during this time. Surface collections, starting in the 1950s, recovered ~13,000 mammalian fossils and >160 Acheulean artifacts. The Elandsfontein faunal assemblage was interpreted as having accumulated through natural mortality and subsequent scavenging by carnivores and hominins, with hominins playing a very minimal role in carcass modification. Low frequencies of stone tool cutmarks were taken as evidence that Acheulean hominins had limited ability to obtain large carcasses. However, this interpretation contrasts with a growing body of evidence suggesting that many Acheulean hominins across sub-Saharan Africa not only had access to large mammal carcasses but were often the primary agents of accumulation and modification. The majority of the original Elandsfontein faunal material was collected from deflation surfaces and lacks sufficient contextual information. We conducted a detailed zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains from four recent excavations within the Elandsfontein dune field. Our results differ from those based on surface collections and suggest multiple agents of bone accumulation with varying degrees of hominin and carnivore activity across the paleolandscape. Frequencies of hominin-induced butchery are higher (up to 3.6% NISP) than reported for previously collected samples (<1% of limb surfaces) and demonstrate butchery of megafauna on at least two occasions. Our findings indicate that earlier zooarchaeological studies at Elandsfontein underestimate the degree of hominin contribution to the fossil assemblage and do not take into account the complicated taphonomic history across the paleolandscape. The results of this analysis are congruent with recent studies suggesting that Acheulean hominins and their Oldowan producing predecessors had regular access to large carcasses and that megafauna were an essential component of the diet for early Homo.},

Recent excavations in three cold lava tube caves have revealed a distinct artifact assemblage of elk antler tines, broken hands tones, and bison bone in association with frozen sagebrush features. Although the archaeological faunal assemblages from the eastern Snake River Plain refute Julian Steward’s arguments that bison were not an important resource to the region’s prehistoric inhabitants until acquisition of the horse, the evidence suggests that only a few bison were acquired during a single hunting event. Successful acquisition may have required a natural “funnel” or other narrow topographic feature, indicating that bison were not present in large numbers. In fact, bison and cold storage caves were likely a single component in a highly mobile seasonal round that apparently persisted for thousands of years. Understanding how bison and cold caves were possibly integrated in the seasonal round may prove to be very useful in elucidating aboriginal foraging strategies on the eastern Snake River Plain.},

This study proposes a simple measure of processing (butchery) intensity—the number of tool strokes amassed during defleshing activities—in an attempt to test this assumption. Data on this measure of processing intensity were collected during the experimental butchery of 16 appendicular carcass segments from large ungulates. Based on the measure of processing intensity utilized here, there seems to be no clear-cut relationship between the number of tool strokes and the resulting frequency of cutmarks or the frequency with which specific bone specimen classes are cutmarked.

 abstract = {According to Robert Hertz, death means a change in social relations. The purpose of this paper is to inquire about the kind of mediation that different world populations establish with their deaths. We compared examples from different eras and regions, and three main strategies are identified which, even if they admit certain number of variations, can be characterized by the persistence of a common logic. These are: distance, in which identities and relations are modified; recycling, when identities are maintained but relations are transformed; and retention, which accepts the transmutation of identities, but not of relations. Once described the qualities of each one, we show that, far from being able to identify any economic-social conditioning, these strategies can coexist as possibilities in the mind of every society.},

 abstract = {Maladaptation to modern diets has been implicated in several chronic disorders. Given the higher prevalence of disease such as dental caries and chronic gum diseases in industrialized societies, we sought to investigate the impact of different subsistence strategies on oral health and physiology, as documented by the oral microbiome. To control for confounding variables such as environment and host genetics, we sampled saliva from three pairs of populations of hunter-gatherers and traditional farmers living in close proximity in the Philippines. Deep shotgun sequencing of salivary DNA generated high-coverage microbiomes along with human genomes. Comparing these microbiomes with publicly available data from individuals living on a Western diet revealed that abundance ratios of core species were significantly correlated with subsistence strategy, with hunter-gatherers and Westerners occupying either end of a gradient of Neisseria against Haemophilus, and traditional farmers falling in between. Species found preferentially in hunter-gatherers included microbes often considered as oral pathogens, despite their hosts' apparent good oral health. Discriminant analysis of gene functions revealed vitamin B5 autotrophy and urease-mediated pH regulation as candidate adaptations of the microbiome to the hunter-gatherer and Western diets, respectively. These results suggest that major transitions in diet selected for different communities of commensals and likely played a role in the emergence of modern oral pathogens.},

 abstract = {Ungulate mortality profiles are commonly used to study Neanderthal subsistence strategies. To assess the hunting strategies used by Neanderthals, we studied the ages at death of the cervids and equids found in levels E, H, I, Ja, Jb, K, L and M of the Abric Romaní sequence. These levels date between 43.2 ± 1.1 ka BP (14C AMS) and 54.5 ± 1.7 ka BP (U-series). The degree of eruption and development of the teeth and their wear stages were used to determine the ages of these animals at death, and mortality profiles were constructed using these data. The equids display prime dominated profiles in all of the analyzed levels, whereas the cervids display variable profiles. These results suggest that the Neanderthals of Abric Romaní employed both selective and non-selective hunting strategies. The selective strategy focused on the hunting of prime adults and generated prime dominated profiles. On the other hand, non-selective strategies, involved the consumption of animals of variable ages, resulting in catastrophic profiles. It is likely that in the selective hunting events were conducted using selective ambushes in which it was possible to select specific prey animals. On the other hand, encounter hunting or non-selective ambush hunting may have also been used at times, based on the abundances of prey animals and encounter rates. Specific hunting strategies would have been developed accordance with the taxa and the age of the individual to be hunted. The hunting groups most likely employed cooperative hunting techniques, especially in the capture of large animals. Thus, it is not possible to uniquely associate a single mortality profile with the predation tactics of Neanderthals at Abric Romaní.},

 abstract = {The Khoisan (Khoesan) languages are spoken by various indigenous population groups that historically issue from hunter-gather mode of subsistence. In the modern setup, they are talked about under the label San (which translates hunter-gatherer), and this sociocultural label has resulted in their marginalization in contact situation with other languages. Khoisan Southern Africa has essentially two language families, the Khoe (Nama, Naro, Gana, Gui, Shua, Buga, Cua) and the San (ǃxoon, ǃxung, ǂHoan). Generally, Khoisan languages have been under-researched, and this explains some misunderstanding and misrepresentation, and even neglect that is associated with them. Socially, they have been mistreated by their neighbours, and the current situation of marginalization and language endangerment they are experiencing is due to social-cultural domination by their neighbours (Batswana, Bakalanga, Wayeyi, etc.). In contact situation, most Khoisan speakers opt to neglect their languages and cultures and thus bring themselves under subordination of their neighbours. Their languages, which are characterized by click sounds, have been less tolerated by the encroaching settler populations around them. Research in all domains is gaining momentum, but most of it is done by expatriate scientists and rarely empowers the Khoisan to revitalize their languages which also present serious challenges in orthography. The presentation of their language names followed by a brief discussion is important for their identification as speech entities and the linguistic and sociolinguistic situations they are currently experiencing. It is imperative that linguists, anthropologists and language planners appreciate the critical areas of intervention for the preservation of these indigenous languages that are endangered and are not passed on to future generations.},

Analysis of HWK EE revealed one of the largest collections of percussive objects from Olduvai Gorge, while excavations at EF-HR have allowed us to recover a much wider collection of percussive tools than previously recorded. Differences are observed between the two localities. At the Acheulean site of EF-HR, percussive tools were predominantly used in the production of flakes and large cutting tools (LCTs). At the Oldowan site of HWK EE, the tool repertoire probably related to a wider range of activities, including bone breaking and bipolar knapping. Comparison of these two assemblages, potentially produced by different hominin species, helps provide a wider picture of pounding activities during the Oldowan-Acheulean transition at Olduvai Gorge.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Besides active hunting by hominins, there are two methods of scavenging that can provide primary access to intact ungulate carcasses: first‐access scavenging from nonpredator‐related accidents and early‐access aggressive scavenging from carnivore kills. Patterns in mortality profiles of prey animals at archaeological sites provide evidence of prey acquisition strategies, which is an important factor in reconstructing hominin adaptability. The Xujiayao site is an early Late Pleistocene site in the Nihewan Basin, China. Its faunal assemblage is dominated by  Equus przewalskii  and  Equus hemionus  . Evidence from previous taphonomic analysis has implied that Archaic Homo was the dominant taphonomic agent in the accumulation of the animal remains. This research applies mortality profile analysis to determine a follow‐up question: how were the equid carcasses acquired? The results of this study indicate that Archaic Homo at Xujiayao probably used both active hunting and scavenging to acquire equids in the early period (lower cultural layer) but mainly used active hunting in the later period (upper cultural layer) due to the fact that the climate changed to much colder conditions in the later period. This research provides new information on the subsistence adaptations of Archaic Homo in northern latitudinal climates of China in the early Late Pleistocene. },

 abstract = {Almost 90% of humans are right handed, but why is unclear. It has been suggested that right handedness evolved in the context of escalating motor and cognitive demands related to tool use. Literature indicates that homicide may have been common in early hominins. Since, in combat with sharp implements, handedness may influence the relative level of exposure of left and right thorax, the hypothesis presented here is that thoracic anatomic asymmetry resulted in a survival advantage for right handed individuals. While fighting with sharp tools, a left hand unilateral grip will rotate the left hemi-thorax towards an opponent. The aims of this study were to quantify the degree of thoracic/cardiac asymmetry in humans and to estimate any difference in risk of injury from a sharp implement attack to the left and the right human thorax. CT-scans of 37 men showed a mean of 73% (SD 7%) of the heart volume to be situated in the left hemi-thorax. Nineteen physicians unaware of the hypothesis estimated the outcome of weapons penetrating the left and right thorax/abdomen at random points. The difference in estimated mortality for left and right thorax was significant, p < 0.001 (Wilcoxon-signed-ranks-test for two related samples). These results suggest greater vulnerability of the left side of the body in combat, and, accordingly, an adaptive value of right-handedness. Thoracic asymmetry may have contributed to the development of right hand preference in humans.},

 abstract = { Studies of bone surface modifications (BSMs) such as cut marks are crucial to our understanding of human and earlier hominin subsistence behavior. Over the last several decades, however, BSM identification has remained contentious, particularly in terms of identifying the earliest instances of hominin butchery; there has been a lack of consensus over how to identify or differentiate marks made by human and non-human actors and varying effectors. Most investigations have relied on morphology to identify butchery marks and their patterning. This includes cut marks, one of the most significant human marks. Attempts to discriminate cut marks from other types of marks have employed a variety of techniques, ranging from subjectively characterizing cut mark morphology using the naked eye, to using high-powered microscopy such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro-photogrammetry. More recent approaches use 3D datasets to obtain even more detailed information about mark attributes, and apply those to the fossil record. Although 3D datasets open promising new avenues for investigation, analyses of these datasets have not yet taken advantage of the full 3D surface morphology of BSM. Rather, selected cross-sectional slices of 3D scans have been used as proxies for overall shape. Here we demonstrate that 3D geometric morphometrics (GM), under the “Procrustes paradigm” and coupled with a Bayesian approach, probabilistically discriminates between marks caused by different butchery behaviors. At the same time, this approach provides a complete set of 3D morphological measurements and descriptions. Our results strengthen statistical confidence in cut mark identification and offer a novel approach that can be used to discriminate subtle differences between cut mark types in the fossil record. Furthermore, this study provides an incipient digital library with which to make future quantitative comparisons to archaeological examples, including contentious specimens that are key to understanding the earliest hominin butchery.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT  Background After three decades of mtDNA studies on human evolution the only incontrovertible main result is the African origin of all extant modern humans. In addition, a southern coastal route has been relentlessly imposed to explain the Eurasian colonization of these African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, from which all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, that out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya. On the opposite side, we have proposed a northern route through Central Asia across the Levant for that expansion. Consistent with the fossil record, we have dated it around 125 kya. To help bridge differences between the molecular and fossil record ages, in this article we assess the possibility that mtDNA macrohaplogroup L3 matured in Eurasia and returned to Africa as basic L3 lineages around 70 kya.   Results The coalescence ages of all Eurasian (M,N) and African L3 lineages, both around 71 kya, are not significantly different. The oldest M and N Eurasian clades are found in southeastern Asia instead near of Africa as expected by the southern route hypothesis. The split of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very similar to the age of mtDNA L3. A Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa has been proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E. Inside Africa, frequency distributions of maternal L3 and paternal E lineages are positively correlated. This correlation is not fully explained by geographic or ethnic affinities. It seems better to be the result of a joint and global replacement of the old autochthonous male and female African lineages by the new Eurasian incomers.   Conclusions These results are congruent with a model proposing an out-of-Africa of early anatomically modern humans around 125 kya. A return to Africa of Eurasian fully modern humans around 70 kya, and a second Eurasian global expansion by 60 kya. Climatic conditions and the presence of Neanderthals played key roles in these human movements. },

Taphonomic analysis show a low incidence of natural processes on the formation and modification of the remains.Taxonomic and anatomic data and other evidence indicate the main faunal resources exploited were Siluriform and Characiform fishes, rodents (Myocastor coypus and Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and large cervids (Blastocerus dichotomus), and that most of these preys would have been carried complete to the site. Finally, we propose the low completeness and high fragmentation ratios observed in medium and large taxa (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris and Blastocerus dichotomus) could be related to an intensive processing strategy which may have involved bone marrow and probably bone grease rendering. },

 abstract = {ABSTRACT  Objectives We investigated the genetic history of southern African populations with a special focus on their paternal history. We reexamined previous claims that the Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b was brought to southern Africa by pastoralists from eastern Africa, and investigated patterns of sex-biased gene flow in southern Africa.   Material and Methods We analyzed previously published complete mtDNA genome sequences and ~900 kb of NRY sequences from 23 populations from Namibia, Botswana and Zambia, as well as haplogroup frequencies from a large sample of southern African populations and 23 newly genotyped Y-linked STR loci for samples assigned to haplogroup E1b1b.   Results Our results support an eastern African origin for Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b; however, its current distribution in southern Africa is not strongly associated with pastoralism, suggesting a more complex origin for pastoralism in this region. We confirm that the Bantu expansion had a notable genetic impact in southern Africa, and that in this region it was probably a rapid, male-dominated expansion. Furthermore, we find a significant increase in the intensity of sex-biased gene flow from north to south, which may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time.   Conclusions Our study shows that the population history of southern Africa has been very complex, with different immigrating groups mixing to different degrees with the autochthonous populations. The Bantu expansion led to heavily sex-biased admixture as a result of interactions between Khoisan females and Bantu males, with a geographic gradient which may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time. },

 abstract = {Humans have occupied a paradoxical position within the history of evolutionary studies. On one end, humans have been central to both the academic motivation of the field and the public tensions surrounding evolution. Simultaneously, humans have been cast aside as a poor model organism for understanding the processes that underlie evolutionary theory. As a result, anthropologists who work within an evolutionary context, often chided as being two decades behind mainstream biology, have come to occupy a unique position with respect to the understanding of how evolution operates on humans. Incorporating theoretical developments from a diverse set of related evolutionary fields, biological anthropologists have begun to gather empirical data on the unique evolutionary processes that have shaped our own evolutionary path. Some of the important components that have emerged in human evolutionary studies—biocultural feedback systems, culturally mediated niche construction, and technological ratchet effects—have shed new light not only on how human evolution has proceeded but also on the range of capabilities of evolution more broadly. While not rejecting traditional neo-Darwinian theory and the importance of genetic inheritance, these new developments have highlighted the tremendous complexity afforded by the cumulative action of both selective and neutral evolutionary forces across a range of inheritance modes. Rather than a poor evolutionary model, many of these evolutionary processes are best, or perhaps only, observable in humans. The traits which have structured critical transitions in our hominin past—encephalization, expanded childhood development, and generative language—open up new windows into thinking about an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.},

 abstract = {The variation and taxonomic diversity among mammalian gut microbiomes raises several questions about the factors that contribute to the rates and patterns of change in these microbial communities. By comparing the microbiome compositions of 112 species representing 14 mammalian orders, we assessed how host and ecological factors contribute to microbiome diversification. Except in rare cases, the same bacterial phyla predominate in mammalian gut microbiomes, and there has been some convergence of microbiome compositions according to dietary category across all mammalians lineages except Chiropterans (bats), which possess high proportions of Proteobacteria and tend to be most similar to one another regardless of diet. At lower taxonomic ranks (families, genera, 97% OTUs), bacteria are more likely to be associated with a particular mammalian lineage than with a particular dietary category, resulting in a strong phylogenetic signal in the degree to which microbiomes diverge. Despite different physiologies, the gut microbiomes of several mammalian lineages have diverged at roughly the same rate over the past 75 million years; however, the gut microbiomes of Cetartiodactyla (ruminants, whales, hippopotami) have evolved much faster and those of Chiropterans much slower. Contrary to expectations, the number of dietary transitions within a lineage does not influence rates of microbiome divergence, but instead, some of the most dramatic changes are associated with the loss of bacterial taxa, such as those accompanying the transition from terrestrial to marine lifestyles and the evolution of hominids.},

These toponyms reflect the diversity of languages that had an influence on words and common names used by local people speaking different languages. Many of these place names are complex and their origins and meanings can only be explained by tracing onymic (naming) formatives in components from cognate words appearing in other languages, often only by deciphering the phonological, orthographic and morphological adaptations that they underwent, or through translated names elucidating the meanings. The findings of this research provide insights into the inter-connected, multilingual context and show names as being verifiable evidence of onymic, lexemic and toponymic exchange. They indicate language elements that survived in names that are part of the toponymic heritage of the region.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Invertebrate consumption is thought to be an integral part of early hominin diets, and many modern human populations regularly consume insects and other arthropods. This study examines the response of gut microbial community structure and function to changes in diet in wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus), a primate that incorporates a large proportion of invertebrates in its diet. The goal of the study is to better understand the role of both fruit and invertebrate prey consumption on shaping primate gut microbiomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples (n = 169) and dietary data were collected over 12 months. The V3-V5 region of microbial 16S rRNA genes was amplified and sequenced. The IM-TORNADO pipeline was used to analyze sequences.
RESULTS: White-faced capuchin gut bacterial communities were characterized primarily by Firmicutes (41.6%) and Proteobacteria (39.2%). There was a significant relationship between the invertebrate diet composition of individual capuchins and their gut microbiome composition. However, there was no relationship between the fruit diet composition of individual capuchins and their gut microbiome composition, even when examining multiple timescales.
DISCUSSION: The results of our study indicate that there is a stronger relationship between gut microbial community structure and invertebrate diet composition than between gut microbial community structure and fruit consumption. As invertebrates and other animal prey play an important role in the diet of many primates, these results give important insight into the role of faunivory in shaping the evolution of host-microbe interactions in primates.},

 abstract = { Recent analyses of archaeological collections have suggested that the frequency, location and micro-morphometric characteristics of cut marks produced when cleaning partially decayed bodies are significantly different from butchery of fresh bodies. The present study attempts to verify this hypothesis by performing incisions into pig body parts at different stages of decay, using different hand pressures and two different types of tool. Focus variation microscopy was used for metric evaluations of experimentally produced cut marks. The clearest metric correlation observed was that greater cutting strength produces wider and deeper cut marks. We also observed that in general, when using the same strength, wider and deeper cut marks are produced on bone with less meat due to the decay (i.e. reduction) of organic tissues. It was also observed that liquefying tissues affect the precision of incisions, causing tools to slip on decaying remains. Finally, no clear metric or morphological differences were observed between cut marks produced using unretouched flakes and unretouched blades.},

 abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful analytical tools available to archaeologists. It has been used to document site formation processes and understand the preservation of organic remains within sites; to investigate pyrotechnology including control of fire, heat treatment of stone, and plaster manufacture; to assess the preservation of charcoal and bone prior to dating or isotope analyses; and, to identify unknown substances inside containers or on artifact surfaces such as stone tools. Most importantly, IR spectroscopy has become an essential tool in the field of microarchaeology, the analysis of the portion of the archaeological record which cannot be seen with the naked eye, yet which contains a wealth of data to address the research areas listed above. IR spectroscopy, long a workhorse of analytical chemistry, is particularly suited to archaeology because it is applicable to many kinds of materials - organic as well as inorganic - and can therefore be used to address a wide range of questions. Sample preparation is rapid and, since minute quantities of a substance are necessary, the technique is ‘microdestructive’. It can also be performed on-site, yielding results in real time that help guide excavation and sampling strategies. The purpose of this review is to detail the basic principles and instrumentation of IR spectroscopy as it has been applied in microarchaeology and related fields of research. The discussion centers on major archaeological applications to date, methodological issues, and recent trends. A special focus is placed on new reflectance techniques.},

 abstract = {Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates in African and African American men are greatly elevated compared with other ethnicities. This disparity is likely explained by a combination of social, environmental, and genetic factors. A large number of susceptibility loci have been reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the contribution of these loci to prostate cancer disparities is unclear. Here, we investigated the population structure of 68 previously reported GWAS loci and calculated genetic disparity contribution statistics to identify SNPs that contribute the most to differences in prostate cancer risk across populations. By integrating GWAS results with allele frequency data, we generated genetic risk scores for 45 African and 19 non-African populations. Tests of natural selection were used to assess why some SNPs have large allele frequency differences across populations. We report that genetic predictions of prostate cancer risks are highest for West African men and lowest for East Asian men. These differences may be explained by the out-of-Africa bottleneck and natural selection. A small number of loci appear to drive elevated prostate cancer risks in men of African descent, including rs9623117, rs6983267, rs10896449, rs10993994, and rs817826. Although most prostate cancer-associated loci are evolving neutrally, there are multiple instances where alleles have hitchhiked to high frequencies with linked adaptive alleles. For example, a protective allele at 2q37 appears to have risen to high frequency in Europe due to selection acting on pigmentation. Our results suggest that evolutionary history contributes to the high rates of prostate cancer in African and African American men.<b>Significance:</b> A small number of genetic variants cause an elevated risk of prostate cancer in men of West African descent. <i>Cancer Res; 78(9); 2432-43. ©2018 AACR</i>.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses a Megatherium americanum atlas from the Pampas region of Argentina, which is currently housed at the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, Italy. Traces of anthropic cut marks were found on the dorsal and ventral faces of the posterior part, in articulation with the axis. This is the first time that this type of evidence has been documented on this element of this species. The position of these marks suggests that they resulted from the act of separating the head from the postcranial skeleton. They were therefore most likely made in an effort to exploit the contents of the head. Current research focusing on museum collections employing modern methods can provide new and valuable information, despite the general lack of contextualization of these pieces. In the case studied here, these methods have allowed us to delve deeper into the first dispersal of Homo sapiens and their interaction with the native fauna in the South American Southern Cone. },

 abstract = {The ability of Homo sapiens to kill prey at a distance is arguably one of the catalysts for our current ecological dominance. Many researchers have suggested its origins lie in the African Middle Stone Age or the European Middle Palaeolithic (∼300-30 thousand years ago), but the perishable components of armatures rarely preserve. Most research on this subject therefore emphasises analysis of armature tip size, shape, and diagnostic impacts or residues. Other lines of evidence have included human skeletal anatomy or analyses of the species composition of faunal assemblages. Projectile Impact Marks (PIMs) on archaeofaunal remains offer an ideal complement to this work, but their potential has been restricted mainly to the later Eurasian zooarchaeological record. A review of current evidence and approaches shows that systematic PIM research could add much to our understanding of early projectile technology, especially in Africa.},

The argument demonstrates that society is not unique to humans, but whilst human sociality is deeply rooted in the common social features of the great apes, new social factors emerged, in particular as our humanoid ancestors moved into risky ecological niches outside tropical rain forests and needed to develop new communicative and shared productive capabilities. These included the development of language, food sharing, cooperative breeding, strong identity and community, and emotional traits such as empathy and sympathy. The Chapter concludes with an analysis of the consequence now for human sociality to survive the future.},

Some of the mufasir mentioned in this article are Ibnu Jarir al-Thabari (w. 310 H), Abu Bakr Ahmad al-Razi al-Jassas al-Hanafi (w. 370 H), Abu al-Laith Nasr bin Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Ibrahim al-Samarqandi (w. 375 H), Abu Hasan Ali bin Muhammad al-Mawardi (w.450 H), Abu Hasan Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi al-Naisaburi (w. 468 H), Abu Muhammad Abdul Haq bin' Athiyyah al-Andalusiy (w. 541 H), Fakhruddin al-Razi al-Shafi'i (w. 606 H), Abu Abdillah Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Ansari al-Qurthubi (w. 671 H), Nasiruddin Abdul Khair Abdullah bin Umar ibn Muhammad al-Baidawi al-Shafi'i (w. 685 H), Abu al-Barkat Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Nasafi (w. 710 H), Abu Hayyan al-Andalusiy (w. 754 H), and Abdurrahman bin Muhammad bin Makhluf Abu Zaid al-Tha'alabi (w. 875 H). Using the ta'wīl method, it was found that the majority of the mufasir did not understand istawa' literally. They do not believe that the meaning of istawa' is that Allah sits or stays at the 'Arsy. They turn the meaning of istawa' from its literal meaning to another meaning which corresponds to His greatness traits. They interpret istawa' with istawla or qahara which means to dominate or to conquer. The choice of the ta'wil method is a logical consequence to reinforce Asy'ari's ideology which believes that Allah exists without any place.},

This chapter outlines that the evolution of asymmetries can be traced back at least 500 million years to a time called the “Cambrian explosion” when most major animal forms appeared. Today, lateralized behavioral patterns like limb preferences are present in all major animal groups. The more a vertebrate hand or claw is used for fine manipulations, the more likely it is to find laterality with a strong population asymmetry. Right-handedness for tool use is seen throughout the primate order, but only in humans with a preponderance of 90% for the whole population. Vocalization asymmetries are also widespread among vertebrates, but only mammals seem to have a consistent left hemispheric bias. Most importantly, these asymmetries pay: Lateralized individuals show higher precision, speed, and parallel- as well as complementary-neural processing capacities during task execution. These advantages are the reason why asymmetries of brain and behavior emerged early in animal history and are widespread today.},

 abstract = {The occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Upper Palaeolithic is mainly known from archaeological sites located in the Cantabrian and Mediterranean regions. Numerous sites have been excavated in these two regions when few sites are found in the interior of the peninsula. Several authors explain this scarcity of sites, in the inner region during the Upper Palaeolithic, by a decrease of human population resulting from a low capacity of human groups to adapt to the cold conditions of the Marine Isotopic Stage 2 (MIS 2), i.e. the effect of cold climate on human populations might have been stronger in the interior of the peninsula than in coastal areas. Recent studies underline the evidence of prehistoric occupation during this period in that region. It has been suggested that these occupations are isolated events limited to the warmest phases of the end of the MIS 2. The present study focuses on zooarchaeological and taphonomic aspects of the Magdalenian site of La Peña de Estebanvela (Segovia, Spain). Our results show that this site was recurrently occupied during the Magdalenian period, including warm and cold phases, which provide a new evidence of sustainable presence of human populations in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. We further propose hypotheses on the subsistence strategies (e.g. availability of hunting resources) developed at La Peña de Estebanvela and in a larger context including other Magdalenian sites of the inner region of the Peninsula.},

 abstract = {Learned aspects of song affect female mating preferences in a number of species of songbirds, including swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana. One explanation for why female songbirds attend to such song features is that these song attributes convey information on the general cognitive ability of singers. The fact that song attributes and cognitive ability are affected during development by the same stressors makes a connection between the two plausible. Here we test the hypothesis that song is a signal of cognitive ability by relating five measures of song quality to five measures of cognitive performance in 49 captive male swamp sparrows. The five song measures are repertoire size, mean and minimum vocal deviation (measures of vocal performance), and mean and maximum typicality (measures of song learning). Cognitive performance was measured as the speed with which five cognitive tasks were mastered: a novel foraging task, a colour association, a colour reversal, a spatial learning problem and a detour-reaching test. In general linear mixed models controlling for neophobia, none of the song measures were predictive of any of the cognitive performance measures. Thus the results do not support the hypothesis that song attributes signal general cognition in swamp sparrows.},

 abstract = {Carrying capacity, the maximum biomass that an ecosystem can sustain over the long term, strongly influences several ecological processes and it is also one of the main determinants of biodiversity. Here, we estimate the carrying capacity (CC) of the late Early and early Middle Pleistocene ecosystems of Europe, using equations describing the relationship between CC and climatic variables observed in the present, as well as maps of inferred paleotemperature and paleoprecipitation. Maps of paleoclimate values were interpolated from the composite benthic stable oxygen isotope ratios and a transfer function was used to estimate ungulate carrying capacity (CC<sub>U</sub>) from the interpolated mean annual temperature and annual precipitation values. Carnivoran carrying capacity was subsequently estimated from ungulate carrying capacity and the effect of CC on the carnivoran faunas was analyzed in 12 paleocommunities from Southern Europe. Our results show that carnivoran species richness is strongly related to ungulate carrying capacity in recent ecosystems, but the late Early Pleistocene paleocommunities from Southern Europe included much richer carnivore guilds than would be expected for a recent community with a similar ungulate carrying capacity. Thus, those late Early Pleistocene ecosystems supported a high number of carnivoran species, but the carnivoran biomass they could support was relatively low. Consequently, carnivorans occurred at low densities in Southern Europe compared to the recent African savanna ecosystems, but likely also compared to coeval East African ecosystems. Consequently, the first Homo populations that arrived in Europe at the end of the late Early Pleistocene found mammal communities consisting of a low number of prey species, which accounted for a moderate herbivore biomass, as well as a diverse but not very abundant carnivore guild. This relatively low carnivoran density implies that the hominin-carnivore encounter rate was lower in the European ecosystems than in the coeval East African environments, suggesting that an opportunistic omnivorous hominin would have benefited from a reduced interference from the carnivore guild.},

 abstract = { Do acts of kindness improve the well-being of the actor? Recent advances in the behavioural sciences have provided a number of explanations of human social, cooperative and altruistic behaviour. These theories predict that people will be ‘happy to help’ family, friends, community members, spouses, and even strangers under some conditions. Here we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the experimental evidence that kindness interventions (for example, performing ‘random acts of kindness’) boost subjective well-being. Our initial search of the literature identified 489 articles; of which 24 (27 studies) met the inclusion criteria (total N = 4045). These 27 studies, some of which included multiple control conditions and dependent measures, yielded 52 effect sizes. Multi-level modeling revealed that the overall effect of kindness on the well-being of the actor is small-to-medium (δ = 0.28). The effect was not moderated by sex, age, type of participant, intervention, control condition or outcome measure. There was no indication of publication bias. We discuss the limitations of the current literature, and recommend that future research test more specific theories of kindness: taking kindness-specific individual differences into account; distinguishing between the effects of kindness to specific categories of people; and considering a wider range of proximal and distal outcomes.

 abstract = {Cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Extensive research has been conducted on cancer; regardless, the link between cancer and diet remains undetermined. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of miRNAs in cancer-associated pathways from the perspective of dietary modulation. We highlighted the recent data on dietary modulation of gut microbiota and miRNAs related to cancer on the basis of recently published results. The targets of miRNAs are oncogenes or tumor suppressors that mediate the progression and initiation of carcinogenesis. Different miRNAs display complex expression profiles in response to dietary manipulation. Various dietary components, such as fatty acids, resveratrol, isothiocyanate, and curcumin, have been effectively used in cancer prevention and treatment. This potency is attributed to the capability of these components to alter miRNA expression, thereby modulating the vital pathways involved in metastasis, invasion, apoptosis, tumor growth, and cell proliferation.},

 abstract = {During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the hunting versus scavenging debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks- 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores-were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.},

 abstract = { Cut marks left on animal bones are commonly found at archaeological sites, and the analyses based on certain differences within their micromorphological structure might help in the material determination of an artefact used in the butchery process. We present a new method for differentiating cut marks made with stone and metal tools by examining the morphoscopical characteristics using a light microscope at a low magnification. Additional goals are testing the soft tissues and cleaning medium impact on the specific cut mark characteristics. The replicas of six types of stone artefacts, together with a bronze knife replica were produced, and also one modern flat-edged steel knife was included for comparison. The experimental cutting on metapodials and ribs of a domestic pig was inflicted within four types of tissues – fresh bone, fibrous tissues, fleshed and roasted bone. The data show that the characteristics of cut marks display evidence of differences between individual materials used in tool production. The condition of bone and the presence of soft tissues lead to differences in cutting process obtaining to the variable structure of cut mark and needs to be considered in the following experimental studies. Moreover, discussion concerning material preference in butchery tool production dated to the Early Bronze Age in the Czech Republic might be supported with such osteological evidence. This study aims to describe cut marks recorded in archaeozoological material from the Pasohlávky site (South Moravia region, Czech Republic) dated to the Early Bronze Age. The methodology expresses enough efficiency in examination of butchery artefacts and the results could be applied in the following analyses within the context of Early Bronze Age South-Moravian sites.},

 abstract = {Understanding how humans and other animals behave in response to changes in their environments is vital for predicting population dynamics and the trajectory of coupled social-ecological systems. Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our framework provides concrete steps in this direction.},

The societies range from US undergraduates to Amazonian, Arctic, and African hunter-gatherers. Behaviour within the games varies markedly across societies. The paper investigates whether this behavioural diversity can be explained solely by variations in inequality aversion. Combining a single parameter utility function with the notion of subgame perfection generates a number of testable predictions. While most of these are supported, there are some telling divergences between theory and data: uncertainty and preferences relating to acts of vengeance may have influenced play in the Ultimatum and Third- Party Punishment Games; and a few subjects used the games as an opportunity to engage in costly signalling.},

Forming groups as means of risk-sharing is also witnessed in many poor countries, in which communities employ risk-sharing arrangements, such as group loans with joint liability. Despite its significance for explaining group formation, the 'Social Insurance' hypothesis has hardly been subjected to systematic experimental testing. Here we report results of three experiments, in which environmental risks were modeled as probable gains or probable losses. For gains, the results supported the hypothesis that individuals form groups and share resources in order to reduce risk. For losses, the results revealed an intriguing switch from a reluctance to join groups under low-risk, to ubiquitous readiness to join under high-risk. These results are discussed in light of Prospect Theory and risk-sensitive models, and their significance to the research on risk-sharing is highlighted.},

Previous research on social welfare attitudes has emphasized the role of political factors such as economic self-interest and ideology. Here, we demonstrate that attitudes to social welfare are also influenced by short-term fluctuations in hunger. Using theories in evolutionary psychology, we predict that hungry individuals will be greedier and take more resources from others while also attempting to induce others to share by signaling cooperative intentions and expressing support for sharing, including evolutionarily novel forms of sharing such as social welfare. We test these predictions using self-reported hunger data as well as comparisons of subjects who participated in relevant online studies before and after eating lunch. Across four studies collected in two different welfare regimes — the UK and Denmark — we consistently find that hungry individuals act in a greedier manner but describe themselves as more cooperative and express greater support for social welfare.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human aggression is a heterogeneous behavior with biological, psychological, and social backgrounds. As the biological mechanisms that regulate aggression are components of both reward-seeking and adversity-fleeing behavior, these phenomena are difficult to disentangle into separate neurochemical processes. Nevertheless, evidence exists linking some forms of aggression to aberrant serotonergic neurotransmission. We determined possible associations between 6 serotonergic neurotransmission-related gene variants and severe criminal offenses.
METHODS: Male Russian prisoners who were convicted for murder (n = 117) or theft (n = 77) were genotyped for variants of the serotonin transporter (5HTTLPR), tryptophan hydroxylase, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, or type 2C (5-HT2C) receptor genes and compared with general-population male controls (n = 161). Prisoners were psychologically phenotyped using the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory.
RESULTS: No differences were found between murderers and thieves either concerning genotypes or concerning psychological measures. Comparison of polymorphism distribution between groups of prisoners and controls revealed highly significant associations of 5HTTLPR and 5-HTR2C (rs6318) gene polymorphisms with being convicted for criminal behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of biological differences between the 2 groups of prisoners indicates that the studied 5HT-related genes do not differentiate between the types of crimes committed.},

 abstract = { The end of the Pleistocene was characterized by an intense, highly selective extinction event, affecting large-bodied terrestrial mammals worldwide. This period coincides with two major events, the last glacial period, and the dispersal of technologically advanced Homo sapiens outside the Old World. Upper Paleolithic hunters were armed with advanced, projectile weapons, and were able to dispatch prey as large as mammoths. As human population size was rapidly expanding, and hence means meat consumption rate was also growing, Paleolithic hunters are often held responsible for the extinction of mammalian megafauna. Yet, whether human focused on megafauna as prey, and drove them to extinction, remains uncertain. Here we model spatial and temporal patterns in habitat suitability for 24 megafauna species and Homo sapiens in Eurasia. We find that within land patches most suitable for humans, the identity of the most abundant herbivorous mammals switched from warm adapted species (such as the wild boar) to cold adapted species (reindeer) as climate switched from mild to cold conditions. Importantly, extinct herbivorous megafauna species were consistently rare within habitat patches optimal for humans. This suggests that humans may have settled under relatively constant climatic conditions, and possibly behaved as efficient predators, exploiting their prey in a cost-effective manner. These results are in accordance with evidence coming from the archaeological record, where medium sized living herbivore species are overrepresented in comparison of their natural abundance. For Late Pleistocene megafauna in Eurasia, human hunting may have been just an additional, non-decisive extinction factor.},

 abstract = {Shell-matrix sites are one of the most widespread archaeological deposits in the world. They inform archaeologists about human adaptations to coastal environments, the evolution of coastal economies, ritual practices, and prehistoric architecture. In recent years, the micromorphological study of Brazilian shellmounds and a shell midden from Tierra del Fuego revealed unique information about the human behaviors related to the formation of shell-matrix sites. These investigations refined our knowledge concerning the upward sequence of events involved in the growth and post-depositional evolution of the deposits. Micromorphological studies denied the traditional view of shell-matrix sites as simple secondary deposits of food remains, providing evidence of trampling surfaces, midden redeposition, domestic spaces, abandonment episodes, and intra-site differences. Dissimilarities were detected in the pre-depositional history of sediments in the shellmounds and shell middens that also attest to differences in site use and function. This comparative study highlights the role of micromorphology in the study of shell-matrix sites as a unique approach intended to disassemble the sequence of events hidden in the intricate stratigraphies. The technique has the potential to reveal microdepositional events and/or the weathering process of the seemingly thick layers of densely packed shell that characterize shell-matrix sites worldwide.},

 abstract = {Immune function is an energetically costly physiological activity that potentially diverts calories away from less immediately essential life tasks. Among developing organisms, the allocation of energy toward immune function may lead to tradeoffs with physical growth, particularly in high-pathogen, low-resource environments. The present study tests this hypothesis across diverse timeframes, branches of immunity, and conditions of energy availability among humans. Using a prospective mixed-longitudinal design, we collected anthropometric and blood immune biomarker data from 261 Amazonian forager-horticulturalist Shuar children (age 4-11 y old). This strategy provided baseline measures of participant stature, s.c. body fat, and humoral and cell-mediated immune activity as well as subsample longitudinal measures of linear growth (1 wk, 3 mo, 20 mo) and acute inflammation. Multilevel analyses demonstrate consistent negative effects of immune function on growth, with children experiencing up to 49% growth reduction during periods of mildly elevated immune activity. The direct energetic nature of these relationships is indicated by (<i>i</i>) the manifestation of biomarker-specific negative immune effects only when examining growth over timeframes capturing active competition for energetic resources, (<i>ii</i>) the exaggerated impact of particularly costly inflammation on growth, and (<i>iii</i>) the ability of children with greater levels of body fat (i.e., energy reserves) to completely avoid the growth-inhibiting effects of acute inflammation. These findings provide evidence for immunologically and temporally diverse body fat-dependent tradeoffs between immune function and growth during childhood. We discuss the implications of this work for understanding human developmental energetics and the biological mechanisms regulating variation in human ontogeny, life history, and health.},

 abstract = {Abstract Cut marks on fossils from Plio‐Pleistocene faunal assemblages can elucidate the timing and nature of hominin procurement of animal tissues. Although butchery experiments have great potential to enhance our ability to understand hominin butchery behaviours, studies that model variation in the timing of access to carcasses and butcher expertise have either yielded conflicting results or have not yet been undertaken. We conducted butchery experiments on 8 pig limbs with replicated Oldowan flake tools that varied the amount of flesh removed prior to butchery (simulating early or late carcass access) and butcher expertise. These experiments investigated the effects of these variables on resultant cut mark count, length, and number of tool strokes. The relationship between the number of tool strokes as a measure of butchery intensity and the number of cut marks produced was also explored. We also compared the length of experimental cut marks with those on 1.5‐million‐year‐old fossil bones from Koobi Fora, Kenya. Although the bones that were partially defleshed prior to butchery had a higher number and longer cut marks on average than fleshed bones, and the expert butcher created fewer and shorter cut marks than the novice butcher, none of these relationships were statistically significant. We found no relationship between the number of tool strokes and the amount of flesh removed prior to butchery or the number of cut marks produced during butchery, although the expert butcher used fewer tool strokes. Although not statistically significant, the length of cut marks created by the novice butcher is much more variable than those created by the expert butcher and the fossil cut marks, and fossil cut marks are much shorter than those created by both modern butchers. More work needs to be undertaken to identify cut mark attributes that may be influenced by behavioural or ecological variables that can be measured and manipulated during butchery experiments.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Unlike any great apes, humans have expanded into a wide variety of habitats during the course of evolution, beginning with the transition by australopithecines from forest to savanna habitation. Novel environments are likely to have imposed hominids a demographic challenge due to such factors as higher predation risk and scarcer food resources. In fact, recent studies have found a paucity of older relative to younger adults in hominid fossil remains, indicating considerably high adult mortality in australopithecines, early Homo , and Neanderthals. It is not clear to date why only human ancestors among all hominoid species could survive in these harsh environments. In this paper, we explore the possibility that hominids had shorter interbirth intervals to enhance fertility than the extant apes. To infer interbirth intervals in fossil hominids, we introduce the notion of the critical interbirth interval, or the threshold length of birth spacing above which a population is expected to go to extinction. We develop a new method to obtain the critical interbirth intervals of hominids based on the observed ratios of older adults to all adults in fossil samples. Our analysis suggests that the critical interbirth intervals of australopithecines, early Homo , and Neanderthals are significantly shorter than the observed interbirth intervals of extant great apes. We also discuss possible factors that may have caused the evolutionary divergence of hominid life history traits from those of great apes. },

 abstract = {Many social scientists believe humans possess an evolved motivation to punish violations of norms-including norm violations that do not harm them directly. However, most empirical evidence for so-called altruistic punishment comes from experimental economics games that create experimental demand for third-party punishment, raising the possibility that the third-party punishment uncovered in these experiments has been motivated by a desire to appear concerned about social norms rather than by actual concern about upholding them. Here we present the results of five experiments in which we used an aggression paradigm to contrast second-party and third-party punishment with minimal experimental demand. We also summarize the results of these experiments meta-analytically. We found robust evidence that participants who were insulted by a stranger experienced anger and punished the insulter. To a lesser degree, participants who witnessed a friend receive an insult also became angry and punished the insulter. In contrast, we found robust evidence that participants who witnessed a stranger receive an insult did not punish the insulter, although they did experience modest amounts of anger. In only one experiment did we find any punishment on behalf of a stranger, and this result could plausibly be explained by the desire to escape the moral censure of other bystanders. Our results suggest that experimental designs that rely on demand-laden methods to test hypotheses about third-party punishment may have overstated the case for the existence of this trait.

We review new insights based on prehistoric modern human genomes, including greatly increased resolution of the timing and structure of the out-of-Africa expansion, the diversification of present-day non-African populations, and the earliest expansions of those populations into Eurasia and America. Prehistoric genomes now document population transformations on every inhabited continent-in particular the effect of agricultural expansions in Africa, Europe, and Oceania-and record a history of natural selection that shapes present-day phenotypic diversity. Despite these advances, much remains unknown, in particular about the genomic histories of Asia (the most populous continent) and Africa (the continent that contains the most genetic diversity). Ancient genomes from these and other regions, integrated with a growing understanding of the genomic basis of human phenotypic diversity, will be in focus during the next decade of research in the field.},

 abstract = {In the last three decades, genetic studies have played an increasingly important role in exploring human history. They have helped to conclusively establish that anatomically modern humans first appeared in Africa roughly 250,000-350,000 years before present and subsequently migrated to other parts of the world. The history of humans in Africa is complex and includes demographic events that influenced patterns of genetic variation across the continent. Through genetic studies, it has become evident that deep African population history is captured by relationships among African hunter-gatherers, as the world's deepest population divergences occur among these groups, and that the deepest population divergence dates to 300,000 years before present. However, the spread of pastoralism and agriculture in the last few thousand years has shaped the geographic distribution of present-day Africans and their genetic diversity. With today's sequencing technologies, we can obtain full genome sequences from diverse sets of extant and prehistoric Africans. The coming years will contribute exciting new insights toward deciphering human evolutionary history in Africa.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe gelada monkey (Theropithecus gelada), endemic to the Ethiopian highlands, is the only graminivorous primate, i.e., it feeds mainly on grasses and sedges. In spite of known dental, manual, and locomotor adaptations, the intestinal anatomy of geladas is similar to that of other primates. We currently lack a clear understanding of the adaptations in digestive physiology necessary for this species to subsist on a graminoid-based diet, but digestion in other graminivores, such as ruminants, relies heavily on the microbial community residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Furthermore, geladas form complex, multilevel societies, making them a suitable system for investigating links between sociality and the GI microbiota.ResultsHere, we explore the gastrointestinal microbiota of gelada monkeys inhabiting an intact ecosystem and document how factors like multilevel social structure and seasonal changes in diet shape the GI microbiota. We compare the gelada GI microbiota to those of other primate species, reporting a gradient from geladas to herbivorous specialist monkeys to dietary generalist monkeys and lastly humans, the ultimate ecological generalists. We also compare the microbiotas of the gelada GI tract and the sheep rumen, finding that geladas are highly enriched for cellulolytic bacteria associated with ruminant digestion, relative to other primates.ConclusionsThis study represents the first analysis of the gelada GI microbiota, providing insights into the adaptations underlying graminivory in a primate. Our results also highlight the role of social organization in structuring the GI microbiota within a society of wild animals.},

Het betreft een nog jonge discipline die ziekte en gezondheid tracht te verklaren vanuit onze evolutionaire achtergrond. Deze kennis is belangrijk voor de identificatie van factoren die een rol spelen in onze huidige ongezonde leefstijl. De discipline komt niet zelden in conflict met heersende wetenschappelijke paradigma’s. In de paleolithische tijd (2,5 miljoen tot 10.000 jaar geleden) is ons brein gegroeid van ongeveer 400 naar 1.300–1.400 mL. Deze groei kon slechts plaatsvinden in het land-water ecosysteem, waar overvloedige hoeveelheden ‘hersen-selectieve nutriënten’ samenkomen. Ze omvatten jodium, selenium, ijzer, vitamines A, D en B12, en de visolievetzuren EPA en DHA. Wereldwijd behoren hun tekorten momenteel tot de meest voorkomende deficiënties. Onze uniek grote verhouding tussen hersen- en totaal lichaamsgewicht heeft ons gevoelig gemaakt voor glucosetekorten. Deze dreigen vooral bij hongeren, zwangerschap en infectie. Hiertoe passen we ons energiemetabolisme aan, onder andere door het veroorzaken van insulineresistentie. Onze huidige ongezonde leefstijl wordt gekenmerkt door chronische stress, chronisch slaapgebrek, wanvoeding, onvoldoende fysieke activiteit, abnormale microbiële flora en milieuverontreiniging. Ze brengen ons in een chronische toestand van lage-graad inflammatie, hetgeen leidt tot metabole aanpassingen. Op lange termijn veroorzaken deze aanpassingen het metabool syndroom en de typische welvaartsziekten, zoals diabetes mellitus type 2, hart- en vaatziekten en bepaalde vormen van kanker.

 abstract = {Abstract
                Microbial community analysis can be biased by multiple technical factors, such as storage conditions, DNA extraction, or amplification conditions. In a high-throughput laboratory that relies on samples obtained from thousands of different subjects, knowledge of the extent of subject-introduced sampling and storage variation on the outcome of the inferred microbiome, as well as the effect of laboratory-introduced variation caused by reagent batches, equipment, or operator on the consistency of these processes within the laboratory is paramount. Here, we analyzed the effect of sampling from different parts of the same stool specimen or on different consecutive days, as well as short-term storage of samples at different temperatures on microbiome profiles obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplification. Each of these factors had relatively little effect on the microbial composition. In addition, replicate amplification of 44 stool samples showed reproducible results. Finally, 363 independent replicate extractions and amplifications of a single human homogenized stool (HS) specimen showed reproducible results (average Lin’s correlation = 0.95), with little variation introduced by HS batch, operator, extraction equipment, or DNA sequencer. In all cases, variations between replicates were significantly smaller than those between individual samples; subject identity always was the largest determinant. We propose that homogenized stool specimens could be used as quality control to routinely monitor the laboratory process and to validate new methods.},

 abstract = {Evidence for fire use becomes increasingly sparse the further back in time one looks. This is especially true for Palaeolithic assemblages. Primary evidence of fire use in the form of hearth features tends to give way to clusters or sparse scatters of more durable heated stone fragments. In the absence of intact fireplaces, these thermally altered lithic remains have been used as a proxy for discerning relative degrees of fire use between archaeological layers and deposits. While previous experimental studies have demonstrated the physical effects of heat on stony artefacts, the mechanisms influencing the proportion of fire proxy evidence within archaeological layers remain understudied. This fundamental study is the first to apply a computer-based model (fiReproxies) in an attempt to simulate and quantify the complex interplay of factors that ultimately determine when and in what proportions lithic artefacts are heated by (anthropogenic) fires. As an illustrative example, we apply our model to two hypothetical archaeological layers that reflect glacial and interglacial conditions during the late Middle Palaeolithic within a generic simulated cave site to demonstrate how different environmental, behavioural and depositional factors like site surface area, sedimentation rate, occupation frequency, and fire size and intensity can, independently or together, significantly influence the visibility of archaeological fire signals.},

 abstract = { Archaeologists endeavour to reconstruct technological, environmental, social, cultural, and even ideological aspects of past groups and individuals using the fragmented material past. Many, if not all, of these analyses rely on analogy. Archaeologists have used the direct historical approach extensively in the Arctic to develop more nuanced understandings of the prehistoric Inuit. In many cases, the direct historical approach is not truly direct; archaeologists often assume that secondary activities, such as those that occur contemporaneously with initial deposition but that are not described in the ethnographic record such as cleaning and post-depositional processes such as weathering, alter the archaeological patterns and inhibit direct comparison to ethnohistoric sources. In this study, I analyse the relationship between the archaeological record and documentary sources to establish which patterns and activities are visible in the archaeofaunal record. I test expectations based on the documentary record, ethnoarchaeological studies, and taphonomic processes against the faunal assemblage from an early Thule Inuit semi-subterranean dwelling at Cape Espenberg, Alaska. Despite expected disturbances from contemporary activities and post-depositional processes, the faunal assemblage closely resembles expectations of primary household activities described in ethnohistoric accounts relating to consumption, preparation, and storage of subsistence resources. Only a few expectations based on secondary activities are supported. Further work is needed to test these results throughout the Arctic and across time. However, these results suggest that archaeologists can use the direct historical approach, and related ethnographic analogies, directly to interpret archaeofaunal patterning in Thule semi-subterranean houses and middens.},

The hygiene hypothesis suggests that increased hygiene level and reduced contacts with natural biodiversity are related to the increase in immune-mediated diseases. We tested whether short-time contact with microbiologically diverse nature-based materials immediately change bacterial diversity on human skin. We tested direct skin contact, as two volunteers rubbed their hands with sixteen soil and plant based materials, and an exposure via fabric packets filled with moss material. Skin swabs were taken before and after both exposures. Next-generation sequencing showed that exposures increased, at least temporarily, the total diversity of skin microbiota and the diversity of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria suggesting that contact with nature-based materials modify skin microbiome and increase skin microbial diversity. Until now, approaches to cure or prevent immune system disorders using microbe-based treatments have been limited to use of a few microbial species. We propose that nature-based materials with high natural diversity, such as the materials tested here, might be more effective in modifying human skin microbiome, and eventually, in reducing immune system disorders. Future studies should investigate how long-term changes in skin microbiota are achieved and if the exposure induces beneficial changes in the immune system markers.},

 In 2000, when the term “archaeogenetics” ( 1 ) was initially proposed to describe the study of the human past by using the techniques of molecular genetics, ancient DNA studies were in their infancy. At that time, DNA data samples provided by geneticists to archaeologists, anthropologists, and linguists for archaeogenetic studies were almost entirely derived from living populations, with a few ancient DNA samples mainly restricted to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, or mitogenome). However, it was already clear that ancient DNA could play a much greater role once a number of major technical problems were resolved. Two studies in this issue exemplify the rapid progress that has been made since then. On page 1028, Ebenesersdóttir et al. ( 2 ) report the genomes of the first Icelanders, and on page 1024, Scheib et al. ( 3 ) use ancient Native American genomes to reconstruct the first phases of the human spread in the Americas. },

 abstract = {Expertise consists of the features that allow individuals with extensive experience on a given complex task to show superior performance on that task compared to novices. While expertise has been investigated mostly in humans, it is highly relevant for other species as well because it can have strong effects on fitness. Moreover, studying expertise in nonhumans can help us understand human expertise. Several features that distinguish experts within their domain of expertise from novices include (1) greater long-term memory, (2) larger capacity of working memory, (3) better ability to focus attention on the most relevant concurrent tasks, (4) superior ability to anticipate, perceive and comprehend the relevant elements in one's surroundings, (5) quicker and better decisions, and (6) faster and more coordinated motor movements. The development of expertise follows a characteristic pattern of gradual improvement in performance over extended periods devoted to practising a given complex task. Heritable variation in a few traits can affect the rate of expertise acquisition and its peak levels. These traits include motivation to practise, perseverance, basic cognitive abilities such as attention span, working memory capacity, learning rates and memory retention, and various physiological, anatomical and morphological features. Key environmental factors influencing expertise development are parental and social settings, which may encourage investment in the extended practice necessary for achieving superior performance on complex tasks. Future work on the evolutionary biology of expertise should focus on the yet unknown neurobiological mechanisms that underlie it, heritable variation in the traits that enable expertise and their genetic basis, further quantifications of expertise acquisition in natural settings, the fitness consequences of the traits that facilitate top expert performance, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of expertise.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Caune de l'Arago is a Middle Pleistocene site in Southern France, where Acheulean artefacts and hominin fossils were excavated. Rhinoceros ( Stephanorhinus hemitoechus ) remains from Level F (MIS 12) were studied from a zooarchaeological and taphonomic perspective to investigate the potential human exploitation of this large taxon. The well‐represented butchering marks, as well as scarce carnivore marks, indicate primary access to rhinoceros carcasses by hominins. The juvenile‐dominated mortality profile further suggests aggressive scavenging or occasional opportunistic hunting. Furthermore, differential skeletal representation shows that humans selectively transported the nutrient‐rich body sections. In addition, thorough processing of the carcasses for consumption inside the cave is highlighted by the frequent cut marks, intensive fragmentation, and regular spatial distribution. The analyses of the Arago Level F rhinoceros confirm the rhinoceros exploitation by humans during the Lower Palaeolithic; however, the rhinoceros mortality profile differs from that of large mammals such as equids, argali, and all other game species of this archaeological layer. Caune de l'Arago is the earliest hominin site where the systematic exploitation of rhinoceros has been documented. },

 abstract = {The traditional archaeological narrative surrounding the early Holocene in the Balkans tends to focus on changes in human cultural material, technology, and subsistence from the Mesolithic into the Neolithic. Demographic continuity—or lack thereof—has been a central debate, but recent models in the eastern Adriatic have increasingly recognized the spatially and temporally nuanced nature of this shift (e.g., Bass 2008; Forenbaher et al. 2013; Forenbaher & Miracle 2005; Orton et al. 2016; Robb & Miracle 2007; Pilaar Birch & Vander Linden 2017). Human lifeways were embedded in local ecologies, which in turn were structured not least by the climatic and environmental conditions that governed the presence and seasonal abundance of myriad plant and animal species. Local environments were affected by changes in seasonal temperature ranges, vegetation, and freshwater availability during this time. In the Adriatic, the sea level increased rapidly following the end of the last ice age, with a short hiatus at the very end of the Pleistocene corresponding with the Younger Dryas (12,900–11,700 bp) (Lambeck et al. 2002, 2004; Surić et al. 2005). It then steadily increased from the initial Holocene until current sea levels were reached between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago, causing the formation of the northern third of the Adriatic Sea and the inundation of the Great Adriatic Plain (Lambeck et al. 2004; Surić 2005; Colantoni et al. 1979). In response to these dramatic transformations at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, the seasonal mobility and subsistence strategies of red and roe deer, chamois, ibex, wild boar, and humans would have had to adapt in both the short and long term.},

 abstract = {La conservation autorise la consommation différée des aliments et permet aux populations humaines de s’affranchir des aléas du climat et de la disponibilité des ressources. Les populations ne pratiquant pas l’agriculture sont fortement dépendantes de leur milieu et le stockage des ressources alimentaires peut donc s’avérer indispensable à la survie du groupe. Ce constat est particulièrement vrai dans des environnements contrastés où les ressources de base sont présentes en abondance sur des laps de temps très courts comme c’est aujourd’hui le cas dans les zones proches du cercle polaire ; la littérature ethnographique illustre bien l’importance du stockage dans ces contextes. Durant la Préhistoire, l’Europe a connu des climats proches de ceux actuellement enregistrés dans les zones subarctiques. Notre enquête a porté sur le temps long, de -80 000 à -14 000 avant le présent, période marquée par une succession de contextes environnementaux variés et qui a également vu l’apparition de l’homme anatomiquement moderne et la disparition de l’homme de Néandertal. Une revue bibliographique des techniques de stockage traditionnelles utilisées par des sociétés de chasseurs-cueilleurs nomades a permis de déterminer celles potentiellement utilisées au Paléolithique. Sur la base des restes osseux de gibier, cet article dresse un bilan des indices pouvant attester du stockage alimentaire chez les populations nomades du Paléolithique, et interroge l’impact socioéconomique de ce type de pratique sur ces populations de chasseurs-cueilleurs.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe main unequivocal conclusion after three decades of phylogeographic mtDNA studies is the African origin of all extant modern humans. In addition, a southern coastal route has been argued for to explain the Eurasian colonization of these African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, from which all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, the out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya. On the opposite side, we have proposed a northern route through Central Asia across the Levant for that expansion and, consistent with the fossil record, we have dated it around 125 kya. To help bridge differences between the molecular and fossil record ages, in this article we assess the possibility that mtDNA macrohaplogroup L3 matured in Eurasia and returned to Africa as basal L3 lineages around 70 kya.ResultsThe coalescence ages of all Eurasian (M,N) and African (L3 ) lineages, both around 71 kya, are not significantly different. The oldest M and N Eurasian clades are found in southeastern Asia instead near of Africa as expected by the southern route hypothesis. The split of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very similar to the age of mtDNA L3. An Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa has been proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E. Inside Africa, frequency distributions of maternal L3 and paternal E lineages are positively correlated. This correlation is not fully explained by geographic or ethnic affinities. This correlation rather seems to be the result of a joint and global replacement of the old autochthonous male and female African lineages by the new Eurasian incomers.ConclusionsThese results are congruent with a model proposing an out-of-Africa migration into Asia, following a northern route, of early anatomically modern humans carrying pre-L3 mtDNA lineages around 125 kya, subsequent diversification of pre-L3 into the basal lineages of L3, a return to Africa of Eurasian fully modern humans around 70 kya carrying the basal L3 lineages and the subsequent diversification of Eurasian-remaining L3 lineages into the M and N lineages in the outside-of-Africa context, and a second Eurasian global expansion by 60 kya, most probably, out of southeast Asia. Climatic conditions and the presence of Neanderthals and other hominins might have played significant roles in these human movements. Moreover, recent studies based on ancient DNA and whole-genome sequencing are also compatible with this hypothesis.},

 abstract = { The Okote Member (1.39–1.53 million-years-ago) of the Koobi Fora Formation preserves a rich and well-resolved lithic archaeological record, but comparatively little is known about the paleoecology of stone tool use during hominins' carnivorous foraging behavior. Archaeological butchery traces are typically found in fragmentary assemblages with well-preserved cortical surfaces that include multiple butchered individuals and carcass parts, but conclusions about butchery behavior, including skeletal element profiles and element and individual estimates may be impacted by specimen identifiability and differential preservation during palimpsest assemblage formation. Here we present an analysis of a fragmentary surface assemblage of fossil bone, designated FwJj70, that includes butchered and tooth-marked specimens and fragments of additional mammal carcasses to explore the archaeological visibility of carcass consumption at the lower boundaries of data quality – in particular, imprecise specimen identifiability and poor assemblage preservation. FwJj70 includes a similar composition of mammalian families and size classes in comparison with the fauna recorded along 400 m of the same stratigraphic horizon but possesses less weathered specimens with fewer post-fossilization and dry fractures, suggesting that bone specimens were rapidly buried. Excavation in search of an in situ origin of the surface assemblage recovered three specimens, but did not reveal a clear archaeological horizon. FwJj70 includes 40 identifiable specimens from at least 21 elements and six mammalian individuals. Eight specimens from a minimum of four elements and a single individual preserve evidence of hominin butchery and may come from a single size-three mammal carcass. However, poor specimen identifiability and ex situ context lead to a coarse estimate of the true number of butchered animals in the assemblage, blurring the distinction between a single carcass butchery episode and consumption of multiple animals, and masking the activity of carnivores. Despite this equifinality, the anatomical location of butchery marks at FwJj70 provides evidence of discrete aspects of hominins' tool-assisted carnivorous foraging niche, including early access to limb flesh packages, bone marrow consumption, and competition with other carnivorous consumers.},

Both popular books and scientific articles attempt to discern the key moments in evolutionary history that indicate the true appearance of our species (or subspecies, depending on one’s classificatory scheme). While scientists are cognizant of the problematic nature of this work, we often use a specific set of dates and material markers as tipping points for the origins and spread of modern humans. Here, we summarize the available data used to indicate behavioral modernity and suggest (1) that key factors traditionally seen as indicative of ‘behaviorally modern’ humans had their origin across the Middle Pleistocene and (2) were not lumped into one cohesive package (or associated with only one species) until more recently. Fossil, genetic, and archaeological datasets indicate that members of our genus (Homo) have been engaging in complex cognitive thought and semiosis since circa 400–300 ka, and perhaps earlier. These data point to a more complex, but more accurate and realistic, depiction of the braided steam of human evolution.},

                  Bacteriophage (phage) dramatically shape microbial community composition, redistribute nutrients
                  via
                  host lysis, and drive evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phage in the human microbiome. We investigated gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups, and Danish pigs, and report that many contain phage belonging to a clade with genomes >540 kb in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phage. We refer to these as Lak phage. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that the Lak phage infect bacteria of the genus
                  Prevotella
                  . We manually curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed, and up to 35 putative tRNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in relative abundance of phage sub-populations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phage are widespread in gut communities that contain
                  Prevotella
                  species, especially in individuals in the developing world, and conclude that megaphage, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes.

Behavioral interpretations of the fossil record hinge strongly upon correct assessment of BSMs. With the significant impact of microscopic analysis to the study of BSMs, multiple authors have discussed the reliability of these technological improvements for gaining resolution in BSM discrimination. While a certain optimism is present, some important questions are ignored and others overemphasized without appropriate empirical support. This specifically affects the study of cut marks. A diversity of geometric morphometric approaches applied to the study of cut marks have resulted in the coexistence (and competition) of different 2D and 3D methods.

Given the vital function of sleep, sleeping patterns and sleep architecture follow dynamic and adaptive processes reflecting trade-offs to different selective pressures. Here, we review responses in sleep and sleep-related behavior to environmental constraints across primate species, focusing on the role of great ape nest building in hominid evolution. We summarize and synthesize major hypotheses explaining the proximate and ultimate functions of great ape nest building across all species and subspecies; we draw on 46 original studies published between 2000 and 2017. In addition, we integrate the most recent data brought together by researchers from a complementary range of disciplines in the frame of the symposium "Burning the midnight oil" held at the 26th Congress of the International Primatological Society, Chicago, August 2016, as well as some additional contributors, each of which is included as a "stand-alone" article in this "Primate Sleep" symposium set. In doing so, we present crucial factors to be considered in describing scenarios of human sleep evolution: (a) the implications of nest construction for sleep quality and cognition; (b) the tree-to-ground transition in early hominids; (c) the peculiarities of human sleep. We propose bridging disciplines such as neurobiology, endocrinology, medicine, and evolutionary ecology, so that future research may disentangle the major functions of sleep in human and nonhuman primates, namely its role in energy allocation, health, and cognition.},

Selama ini, Syar h A h âdîts Al-A h kâm belum banyak dikaji secara mendalam tentang substansi hadits-hadits hukumnya dan konstruknya pun terlihat belum jelas hingga yang tampak adalah terlalu banyak mengekspos hadits-haditsnya namun minim penjelasan atau interpretasinya ( syarh ). Hal ini berimbas terhadap format pembelajaran Syar h A h âdîts Al-A h kâm yang dirasakan masih belum terstruktur dan terarah tujuannya. Karena itu, konstruk dalam Syar h A h âdîts Al-A h kâm sebaiknya terdiri dari dua ruang lingkup (objektifitas) pembahasannya, yaitu hukum ibadah ( fiqh al-’ibâdah , al-’ibâdât ) dan hukum muamalah interaksional ( fiqh al-mu’âmalah , al-mu’âmalât ) misalnya dengan referensi utama kitab Bulûgh Al-Marâm min Adillah Al-A h kâm karya Ibn H ajar Al-’Asqalânî Al-Syâfi’î atau karya lainnya dengan mengkaji sekitar 3-5 hadits saja yang menjadi subbab dalam tiap babnya. Adapun format pembelajarannya, maka dapat diterapkan langkah ilmiah-aplikatif dalam penyusunan karya ilmiah untuk pembelajaran yang meliputi penentuan tema hadits, penulisan teks hadits dan terjemahannya, takhrîj al- h adîts , kosakata ( mufradât ), biografi perawi, latar historis hadits ( asbâb wurûd al- h adîts ) bila ada, penjelasan atau interpretasi ( syar h ) hadits, dan kesimpulan hukum atau faedah haditsnya. Keywords: hadits, ahkam, syarah hadits ahkam.},

 abstract = {The origin of colour categories and their relationship to colour perception have been the prime example for testing the influence of language on perception and thought (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) and more generally for investigating the biological, ecological and cultural determination of human cognition (nature-nurture debate). These themes are central to a broad range of disciplines, including vision research, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental science, cultural anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy. Unfortunately, though, it has been tacitly taken for granted that the conceptual assumptions and methodological practices from the dawn of empirical research on colour categorisation are the gold standard for current colour category research. Here, we show that these assumptions and practices are obsolete and flawed and have led to four fundamental and widespread misconceptions about colour categorisation: 1.) that colour perception is inherently categorical; 2.) that English Basic Colour Terms correspond to universal categories that are the end point of a fixed evolutionary sequence; 3.) that the prototypes of English basic colour terms are perceptually salient and qualify as focal colours; and 4.) that colour category research essentially revolves around the universalism-realism debate. State-of-the-art research on colour categorisation provides new, more sophisticated approaches and allows for rectifying those four statements. At the same time, some of the questions underlying those statements are not convincingly answered yet and constitute major challenges to future research. The critical considerations on colour categorisation may be transferred to research on other kinds of perceptual categorisation to inspire new, more general research questions.},

 abstract = {Historians of science have identified an ecological turn underway in immunology, driven by the mapping of the human microbiome and wider environmentalist anxieties. A figure is emerging of the human as a holobiont, composed of microbes and threatened by both microbial excess and microbial absence. Antimicrobial approaches to germ warfare are being supplemented by probiotic approaches to restoring microbial life. This article examines the political ecology of this probiotic turn in Western health care. It focuses on Necator americanus-a species of human hookworm-and its relations with immunologists. The analysis moves from a history of human disentanglement from hookworm, to contemporary anxieties about their absence. It examines the reintroduction of worms for helminthic therapy and explores emerging trajectories for probiotic health care involving the synthesis, modification, and/or restoration of worms and their salutary ecologies. The conclusion differentiates these trajectories and identifies an emerging model of "post-paleo" microbiopolitics.},

 abstract = {Stratigraphic Unit 13 of Oscurusciuto Rockshelter (Ginosa, Taranto, Southern Italy) is a short Mousterian palimpsest representing the first stable occupation of the site soon after the deposition of a thick layer of tephra (Mt. Epomeo Green Tuff - Ischia datable around 55 kya BP). Different activities were identified by integrating the study of lithic finds, faunal remains, and the microarchaeology of combustion features. Additionally, geo-statistical analysis of these data has been carried out using a specifically designed geodatabase within a GIS platform. Our results produced an articulated picture of this Neanderthal site as a tripartite location made of spatially segregated and integrated activity areas. A hearths' alignment (parallel to the rockshelter wall) divides the settled area into an inner and outer part. The inner part, between the hearths and the shelter wall, displays an abrupt rarefaction of the anthropic finds and was interpreted as a possible sleeping/resting area. In the outer part, several multipurpose activity areas have been identified, mostly associated with the combustion features. The Northern sector of the settlement appears devoted particularly to lithic production (to a lesser degree, activities related with lithic tools use and faunal processing took place). In the Southern sector the main activities carried out represent more intensive production and use of lithic tools and the butchering and consumption of animal resources. Additionally, in this sector evidence of space maintenance behaviour (cleaning up of working areas and refuse dumping) has been attested.},

 abstract = { Middle Pleistocene unit TD10 of the Gran Dolina site is nearly four metres thick and is divided into four subunits (TD10.1, TD10.2, TD10.3, TD10.4). To date, the upper two subunits (TD10.1 and TD10.2) have been completely excavated and have been studied from zooarchaeological, taphonomic and occupational perspectives. The top of the sequence (Upper TD10.1), however, has not undergone these types of studies until now. In this paper we report the results of our analyses of the anatomical profiles, age, and the anthropogenic and carnivore-induced modifications in this assemblage. Methods employed to evaluate sequential scenarios (carnivore to hominin; hominin to carnivore; carnivore to hominin to carnivore) have led to contradictory results. We conclude that the formation of Upper TD10.1 is the product of the overlap of independent events (hominin only and carnivore only), with limited commensalism between the two agents. The type of accumulation is consistent with the characteristics of an accumulative palimpsest generated by different actors. Unlike those documented in the lower levels of TD10 (TD10.1BB and TD10.2BB), hominin occupations in this part of the sequence were very brief. This scenario completes the picture of the types of occupations that took place during the end of Middle Pleistocene at Gran Dolina. In short, level TD10 was the site of three types of occupation by Middle Pleistocene hominins: a kill/butchering site in TD10.2BB, a long-term residential camp in TD10.1BB, and finally, logistical and short-term occupations in Upper TD10.1.},

 abstract = {Hypothesis-driven research has led to many scientific advances, but hypotheses cannot be tested in isolation: rather, they require a framework of aggregated scientific knowledge to allow questions to be posed meaningfully. This framework is largely still lacking in microbiome studies, and the only way to create it is by discovery-driven, tool-driven, and standards-driven research projects. Here we illustrate these issues using several such non-hypothesis-driven projects from our own laboratories, including spatial mapping, the American Gut Project, the Earth Microbiome Project (which is an umbrella project integrating many smaller hypothesis-driven projects), and the knowledgebase-driven tools GNPS and Qiita. We argue that an investment of community resources in infrastructure tasks, and in the controls and standards that underpin them, will greatly enhance the investment in hypothesis-driven research programs.},

 abstract = {Shell beads are well established in the archaeological record of sub-Saharan Africa and appear as early as 75,000 BP; however, most research has focused on ostrich eggshell (OES) and various marine mollusc species. Beads made from various land snails shells (LSS), frequently described as Achatina, also appear to be widespread. Yet tracking their appearance and distribution is difficult because LSS beads are often intentionally or unintentionally lumped with OES beads, there are no directly dated examples, and bead reporting in general is highly variable in the archaeological literature. Nevertheless, Achatina and other potential cases of LSS beads are present at over 80 archaeological sites in at least eight countries, spanning the early Holocene to recent past. Here, we collate published cases and report on several more. We also present a new case from Magubike Rockshelter in southern Tanzania with the first directly dated LSS beads, which we use to illustrate methods for identifying LSS as a raw material. Despite the long history of OES bead production on the continent and the abundance of land snails available throughout the Pleistocene, LSS beads appear only in the late Holocene and are almost exclusively found in Iron Age contexts. We consider possible explanations for the late adoption of land snails as a raw material for beadmaking within the larger context of environmental, economic, and social processes in Holocene Africa. By highlighting the existence of these artifacts, we hope to facilitate more in-depth research on the timing, production, and distribution of LSS beads in African prehistory.},

 abstract = { Archaeoparasitology is increasingly being used as a tool in archaeological research to investigate relationships between past humans, environments, diets and disease. It can be particularly useful in contexts where parasite eggs preserve, but human and faunal remains do not, including in the identification of disease and/or dietary items otherwise absent from the local archaeological record. We analyzed soil samples from the Late Mesolithic layers of the lake island site of Derragh in County Longford, Ireland. All samples were positive for the presence of Diphyllobothrium sp., an intestinal fish tapeworm that infects humans, causing diphyllobothriasis. Though fish are thought to be a staple food in Mesolithic Ireland, evidence for fishing and subsistence from this period is extremely fragmentary. Similarly, there is little available evidence for disease, primarily due to the lack of human remains. This finding represents the earliest known presence of human-derived parasites in Ireland, the earliest known finding of Diphyllobothrium sp. in Europe and the only finding of the tapeworm from hunter-gatherer contexts. It suggests parasitic infections, particularly those resulting from undercooked food, may be more common in ancient hunter-gatherer populations than previously suspected. The presence of these zoonotic parasites at hunter-gatherer sites can provide important insight into local environments, health and disease, and culinary practices. In locations like Mesolithic Ireland, the presence of parasites may assist in the identification of subsistence activities, such as fishing, and specific prey.},

 abstract = {Becoming valuable to fellow group members so that one would attract assistance in times of need is a major adaptive problem. To solve it, the individual needs a predictive map of the degree to which others value different acts so that, in choosing how to act, the payoff arising from others' valuation of a potential action (e.g., showing bandmates that one is a skilled forager by pursuing a hard-to-acquire prey item) can be added to the direct payoff of the action (e.g., gaining the nutrients of the prey captured). The pride system seems to incorporate all of the elements necessary to solve this adaptive problem. Importantly, data from western(-ized), educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies indicate close quantitative correspondences between pride and the valuations of audiences. Do those results generalize beyond industrial mass societies? To find out, we conducted an experiment among 567 participants in 10 small-scale societies scattered across Central and South America, Africa, and Asia: (<i>i</i>) Bosawás Reserve, Nicaragua; (<i>ii</i>) Cotopaxi, Ecuador; (<i>iii</i>) Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco; (<i>iv</i>) Enugu, Nigeria; (<i>v</i>) Le Morne, Mauritius; (<i>vi</i>) La Gaulette, Mauritius; (<i>vii</i>) Tuva, Russia; (<i>viii</i>) Shaanxi and Henan, China; (<i>ix</i>) farming communities in Japan; and (<i>x</i>) fishing communities in Japan. Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, pride in each community closely tracked the valuation of audiences locally (mean <i>r</i> = +0.66) and even across communities (mean <i>r</i> = +0.29). This suggests that the pride system not only develops the same functional architecture everywhere but also operates with a substantial degree of universality in its content.},

 abstract = { The aim of the present study was to characterize selected by-products from Brazilian food industry and their in vitro digestibility. These by-products (cassava and orange bagasses and passion fruit peels) are potentially rich sources of dietary fibres, but currently they are mostly disposed. Their analysis revealed differences in composition for the same by-product type from different suppliers. Cassava bagasses were mainly composed of starch, with high variability among tested by-products (45–77.5% starch). In vitro experiments indicated that cassava bagasses had ~ 12% of resistant starch. The orange bagasses had free glucose and highly methyl esterified pectin as the main constituents (~23.5% of total pectin). Seventy-seven % of digestible glucose present in the orange bagasse were absorbed within 3 h experimental run. Passion fruit peels were a good source of fibres, especially pectin (~19%) and (hemi)cellulose (~16%). These in vitro experiments indicated that passion fruit peel had slower absorption of glucose than the other by-products, with 80% of digestible glucose absorbed within 5 h. In conclusion, the tested by-products are good sources of diverse types of fibres and have a great potential to be incorporated into different food products, decreasing food waste and contributing to a sustainable food system.},

 abstract = {Despite much theorizing, the evolutionary reasons why humans cooperate extensively with unrelated individuals are still largely unknown. While reciprocity explains many instances of non-kin cooperation, much remains to be understood. A recent suite of models based upon ‘cooperative assortativity’ suggest that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals preferentially assort with certain cooperative phenotypes, such as helping those who help others. Here, we test these assortative hypotheses among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using an experimental resource allocation game in which individuals divide resources between themselves and camp-mates. Individuals preferentially shared with less cooperative individuals, arguing against cooperative assortativity as a mechanism sustaining resource transfers in this population. Rather, sharing was often based on the recipient's level of need, in addition to kin-based transfers and reciprocal sharing. Contrary to several recent theoretical accounts, in this real-world setting we find no evidence for cooperative assortativity influencing patterns of cooperation. These results may reflect the demands of living in a foraging ecology characterized by high resource stochasticity, necessitating need-based sharing as a system of long-term reciprocity to mitigate repeated subsistence shortfalls.},

 abstract = {Did artificial light reshape human sleep/wake cycle? Most likely the answer is "yes". Did artificial light misalign the sleep/wake cycle in industrialized societies relative to the natural cycle of light and dark? For the average person ---that is, obviating the tail of the distributions--- the answer is probably not. Sleep timing in extratropical, industrial (data from eight national time use surveys) societies and Subtropical, pre-industrial societies (data from nine locations coming from seven previous reports) with and without access to artificial light  finds in winter a remarkable accommodation with sunrise time along a wide range of angular distance to the Equator (0° to 55°). Within the two process model of sleep, results show sleep onset and sleep offset keep bound to each other by the homeostatic process, while the photoreceptive process aligns the phase of the sleep/wake cycle to winter sunrise. This results in a phase increasingly lagging with increasing latitude up to a delay of 2h at 55° latitude. In the summer season, the homeostatic process persists binding sleep onset to speep offset but Daylight Saving Time regulations in industrialized societies reduce the lag to 40min at 55° latitude. Sleep timing is then stationary with latitude.},

 abstract = {Nearly all Indigenous populations today suffer from worse health than their non-Indigenous counterparts, and despite interventions against known factors, this health "gap" has not improved. The human microbiome-the beneficial, diverse microbial communities that live on and within the human body-is a crucial component in developing and maintaining normal physiological health. Disrupting this ecosystem has repercussions for microbial functionality, and thus, human health. In this article, we propose that modern-day Indigenous population health may suffer from disrupted microbial ecosystems as a consequence of historical colonialism. Colonialism may have interrupted the established relationships between the environment, traditional lifeways, and microbiomes, altering the Indigenous microbiome with detrimental health consequences.},

 abstract = {The formation of dental caries is mainly caused by dietary habits and therefore, may contain information for dietary reconstructions of fossil hominids. This study investigates the caries lesion in the 12.5 Ma old type specimen of Dryopithecus carinthiacus Mottl 1957 (Primates, Hominidae) from St. Stefan (Austria). Potential food sources are identified on associated palynological data, which allow conclusions about food quality, sugar availability and the hominid metabolism during the Middle Miocene. Using micro computed tomography (μCT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) we provide a detailed analysis and characterization of the individuals' caries type. Its lesion is compared with a dataset of 311 wild chimpanzees, indicating morphological and etiological differences in caries formation between both species. The affected molar of D. carinthiacus reveals features known from severe dental caries in humans: (1) Cavitation with steep walls and smooth surface; (2) Reparative dentine at the roof of the pulp chamber; (3) Sclerotic dentine below the cavitation; (4) Association with dental calculus and (5) Unilateral usage of the healthy right tooth row. Its advanced primary caries, initiating on the intact enamel surface, indicates a frequent intake of highly cariogenic sugar-rich fruits, which likely exceeds the frugivory of extant chimpanzees. This finding corresponds with the associated palynological record, which infers a habitat with nearly year-round supply (9-10 months/year) of high quality foods (>carbohydrates; < fibers). Our conclusions challenge the model of a step-wise increase in dietary quality during hominid evolution and support the uricase hypothesis, which discusses the hominid autapomorphy of a fructose-based fat accumulation for periods of starvation. This model receives further validation by the identification of soft-tissue preservation, interpreted as fossilized white adipose cells, in the articulated hominid skeleton of Oreopithecus bamboli from Italy.},

 abstract = { Umbeli Belli is a quartzite rock shelter located in the Mpambanyoni river valley in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Building on earlier work by Cable in 1979 we excavated the site in three seasons between 2016 and 2018 and recovered important archaeological data on the later part of the Middle Stone Age [MSA] and the Later Stone Age [LSA]. New OSL dates of the sequence demonstrate that the site was used intensively during the final MSA and the Pleistocene LSA. We identified 12 geological units covering a sequence of nearly 2 m thickness. Excavations have not yet reached bedrock. Here we focus on the assemblage from layer 7 which marks the latest expression of the MSA at Umbeli Belli. The layer provided an OSL age of 29 ± 2 ka and was found to contain some of the most distinct formal tools of the MSA, the so-called hollow-based points. Taking aside two isolated finds from Kleinmonde and Border Cave, this tool type was elsewhere found exclusively within the terminal MSA occupations of Sibudu and Umhlatuzana. Notwithstanding the fact that hollow-based points are likely to represent one of the most reliable fossil directeurs of the MSA, neither the tools themselves nor the corresponding assemblages in which they are found have so far received adequate attention compared to other periods. Based on current results from Umbeli Belli we provide new techno-typological evidence about the final MSA in the eastern part of South Africa together with new radiometric dates. We observe first that hollow-based points are not the only defining feature of the final MSA and should be rather seen as embedded within a diagnostic technocomplex. We question existing typological differentiations of traditional tool types, such as unifacial and bifacial points, and provide alternative assessments based on the morphological and physical properties of retouched tools. Finally we discuss the final MSA period in and surrounding KwaZulu-Natal in the light of new dating results and address future perspectives.},

A language family is a set of languages for which there is sufficient evidence to show that they descend from a single common ancestral language and are therefore phylogenetically related to one another. Some languages which were once thought to be isolates have proven to be members of small families of related languages. This illustrates a second way in which language isolates and language families are not so different from one another. An unclassified language is one for which there is not enough data to determine whether it has relatives - for these languages, there is insufficient data to compare them meaningfully with other languages, and therefore any possible kinship they may have remains unknown.},

However, there are few undisputed isolates, as well as a number of languages which have been considered isolates but which turn out either to be affiliated to a larger phylum or to be undecidable for lack of adequate data. The paper presents an overview of the main methodological issues which have divided African scholars, in particular discussing the view there may be many more isolates, as some phyla are insecure. The paper focuses on four languages, Laal, Hadza, Bangi Me and Jalaa which are relatively uncontroversial. The longer list, which includes Ongota, Shabo, Meroitic, Mpra and others is discussed in less detail. Finally it considers whether substrates can be detected in the language of foragers who now speak the languages of their settled neighbours.

However, there are few undisputed isolates, as well as a number of languages which have been considered isolates but which turn out either to be affiliated to a larger phylum or to be undecidable for lack of adequate data. One of the notable differences between Africa and most other linguistic areas is its relative uniformity. The perceived diversity of a linguistic region is not entirely the result of a rigorous scientific process; it also reflects strongly the patterns established in the early period of scholarship. Greenberg is largely responsible for the concept of Nilo-Saharan as a construct, and there was neither a body of existing scholarship binding together its putative subgroups nor was the case self-evident. The identification of isolates depends on the tools used to classify languages.},

The social practice of sharing as described in the ethnographic record has a distinctive profile whereby others are allowed access to something of value without specific obligations of return transfers. As such, sharing can be clearly distinguished from other forms of social transactions such as gift exchange, reciprocity, pooling, and redistribution. Most ethnographic examples of sharing are from hunter‐gatherer societies, where sharing is the dominant way of acquiring and allocating goods. Sharing is also prominent in many evolutionary debates because it challenges selection models premised on human action as maximizing fitness and optimizing individual benefits. At the same time, the ethnographic record of sharing practices underlines that generosity is not a necessary condition for sharing, while demand sharing is its prototypical form.},

 abstract = {Individuals vary in their propensity to use social learning, the engine of cultural evolution, to acquire information about their environment. The causes of those differences, however, remain largely unclear. Individuals that experience high reproductive skew are expected to favour high-risk strategies, whereas those that experience low reproductive skew are expected to favour risk-averse strategies. Using an agent-based model, we tested the hypothesis that differences in energetic requirements for reproduction affect the value of social information. We found that social learning is associated with lower variance in yield and is more likely to evolve in risk-averse low-skew populations than in high-skew populations. Reproductive skew may also result in sex differences in social information use, as females tend to be more risk averse than males. To explore how risk may affect sex differences in learning strategies, we simulated learning in sexually reproducing populations. Where both sexes share the same environment they adopt more extreme learning strategies, approaching pure individual or social learning. These results provide insight into the conditions that promote individual and species level variation in social learning and so may affect cultural evolution.},

 abstract = {The Abrigo de la Quebrada (Chelva, Valencia) stratigraphic succession comprises nine Middle Palaeolithic levels. Human selection of this rock shelter for occupation owes to its favourable location—at the gates of a blind valley where the trapping of large herbivores would have been practicable. The immediate environment is varied, with both abrupt and flat terrain, and would have supported a wide range of prey animals. Radiocarbon-dated charcoal samples from level IV, which is characterised by a high density of lithic (> 18,000) and bone (> 100,000) remains, yielded results of 43,930 ± 750 BP (Beta-244002) and > 51,6 ka BP (OxA-24855). There is no evidence of modification by carnivores or birds of prey, so this level’s faunal remains must be anthropogenic in the main. Relative to the inhabited space, the location of level IV’s many combustion features shows little variation. The level’s typical palimpsest structure results from frequent, repeated occupations with intense on-site processing in a context of low sedimentation rates. The study of seasonality, carcass exploitation, taphonomy, stone tool refitting and raw material provenience patterns supports the notion that the different occupations subsumed in the level IV deposit were all short term. The comparison of our results with coeval contexts from the central area of Mediterranean Iberia sheds additional light on the adaptations of western Europe’s Neanderthal groups.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated the genetic history of southern African populations with a special focus on their paternal history. We reexamined previous claims that the Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b (E-M293) was brought to southern Africa by pastoralists from eastern Africa, and investigated patterns of sex-biased gene flow in southern Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed previously published complete mtDNA genome sequences and ∼900 kb of NRY sequences from 23 populations from Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia, as well as haplogroup frequencies from a large sample of southern African populations and 23 newly genotyped Y-linked STR loci for samples assigned to haplogroup E1b1b.
RESULTS: Our results support an eastern African origin for Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b (E-M293); however, its current distribution in southern Africa is not strongly associated with pastoralism, suggesting more complex demographic events and/or changes in subsistence practices in this region. The Bantu expansion in southern Africa had a notable genetic impact and was probably a rapid, male-dominated expansion. Our finding of a significant increase in the intensity of the sex-biased gene flow from north to south may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the population history of southern Africa has been complex, with different immigrating groups mixing to different degrees with the autochthonous populations. The Bantu expansion led to heavily sex-biased admixture as a result of interactions between Khoisan females and Bantu males, with a geographic gradient which may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time.},

 abstract = {A key feature of human prosociality is <i>direct transfers</i>, the most active form of sharing in which donors voluntarily hand over resources <i>in their possession</i> Direct transfers buffer hunter-gatherers against foraging shortfalls. The emergence and elaboration of this behaviour thus likely played a key role in human evolution by promoting cooperative interdependence and ensuring that humans' growing energetic needs (e.g. for increasing brain size) were more reliably met. According to the <i>strong prosociality hypothesis</i>, among great apes only humans exhibit sufficiently strong prosocial motivations to directly transfer food. The <i>versatile prosociality hypothesis</i> suggests instead that while other apes may make transfers in constrained settings, only humans share flexibly across food and non-food contexts. In controlled experiments, chimpanzees typically transfer objects but not food, supporting both hypotheses. In this paper, we show in two experiments that bonobos directly transfer food but not non-food items. These findings show that, in some contexts, bonobos exhibit a human-like motivation for direct food transfer. However, humans share across a far wider range of contexts, lending support to the versatile prosociality hypothesis. Our species' unusual prosocial flexibility is likely built on a prosocial foundation we share through common descent with the other apes.},

These practices result in a wide range of anthropogenic features, which may be observed in soil and regolith thin sections, potentially enabling interpretation of both the type and nature of the practice itself. Variation in the intensity of such practices, especially contrasts between one single event and annual repetition, may lead to pronounced contrasts in the features observed between sample sites. This potentially confounds analyses and limits interpretation. By considering examples from a range of agricultural and other managed landscapes and through discussion of examples from research literature, this chapter aims to the further understanding of anthropogenic features observed for soils, allowing interpretation of a range of processes.},

 abstract = {This article presents an analysis of faunal remains from Laonainaimiao, a late Middle Palaeolithic site in Henan Province. The site deposit is subdivided into five layers, among which Layer 3 yielded the most abundant archaeological remains including lithics, animal bones, and fireplaces. There are a series of repeated human occupations dating to about 40,000 b.p. Taphonomic observations demonstrate that the animal bones accumulated in Layer 3 are the result of human activities. The assemblage is dominated by horse and aurochs, followed by gazelle, deer, wild boar, and rhinoceros. The equids and bovids show a prime-age dominated profile indicating the capability for hunting large game during the Middle Palaeolithic. According to detailed analysis of skeletal parts, bone fracture patterns, and bone modifications, the carcasses were probably transported to the site whole for butchery. Marrow and grease were fully extracted. The intensive utilization of the carcasses reflects a very high food demand. Such a behavioral pattern may result from lower availability of food due to the palaeoenvironment, seasonality, or group size or from the poor quality of the food, which pushed people to maximize the carcasses.},

 abstract = {Property is a key feature of modern human society; however, identifying the origin of this multifaceted behavior poses a formidable challenge. Here, we explore the methodologies for researching the origin of property. We discuss how an interdisciplinary approach can shed light on how our human ancestors shifted behaviorally from possessing an object to having exclusive property control over it. Possession occurs when social group members only respect an individual's claim to have exclusive access to an object when the individual has physical control over the object. Property occurs when an individual can claim exclusive access to an object, without challenge, regardless of whether the object is in their physical control or not. Researchers across different disciplines have asked what, if anything, distinguishes human property behavior from the behavior of other animals? Further, when and how did this behavior evolve in our lineage? Due to the considerable methodological challenges posed by researching this topic, few studies have been able to directly address these questions. In this review, we explore the challenges involved in defining property and possession and suggest a two-step approach to interdisciplinary definitions. Next, we evaluate four core approaches to the study of property behavior: evolutionary game theory, ethology, comparative cognition, and developmental psychology. Finally, we propose an empirical study, using an ethological approach to test the presence of property and possessive behavior in a natural setting, using our closest living relative, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Overall, we argue that this field of research is at a turning point, where the novel integration of various methods may provide an explanation to the origin of property.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mucosal immune cells in the intestinal tract are continuously exposed to a barrage of both foreign and endogenously generated metabolites, termed xenobiotics, and endobiotics, respectively. This review summarizes recent insights into the mechanisms by which xenobiotics and endobiotics regulate intestinal immunity and inflammation.
RECENT FINDINGS: The community of enteric microbes (i.e., microbiota) has profound impacts on the development and function of the mucosal immune system. The composition and function of gut microbiota is dynamically regulated by diet, and this interplay dictates which and how many immunomodulatory xenobiotics are present in the intestine. Microbiota also regulate the concentration and composition of circulating bile acids, an abundant class of liver-derived endobiotics with pleotropic immunoregulatory activities. A growing body of literature is emerging that sheds new light on the mechanisms by which xenobiotics and endobiotics interact with germline-encoded receptors and transporters to shape mucosal immune function.
SUMMARY: The complex and dynamic interplay among xenobiotics, endobiotics, and the mucosal immune system is a new frontier in mucosal immunology that is proving fruitful for the discovery of novel and pharmacologically accessible mechanisms with relevance to human inflammatory diseases.},

 abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is two- to three-fold more common in African Americans (AAs) compared to European Americans (EAs). This striking disparity, one of the highest of any cancer, may be due to underlying genetic predisposition between these groups. There are multiple unique cytogenetic subtypes of MM, and it is likely that the disparity is associated with only certain subtypes. Previous efforts to understand this disparity have relied on self-reported race rather than genetic ancestry, which may result in bias. To mitigate these difficulties, we studied 881 patients with monoclonal gammopathies who had undergone uniform testing to identify primary cytogenetic abnormalities. DNA from bone marrow samples was genotyped on the Precision Medicine Research Array and biogeographical ancestry was quantitatively assessed using the Geographic Population Structure Origins tool. The probability of having one of three specific subtypes, namely t(11;14), t(14;16), or t(14;20) was significantly higher in the 120 individuals with highest African ancestry (≥80%) compared with the 235 individuals with lowest African ancestry (<0.1%) (51% vs. 33%, respectively, p value = 0.008). Using quantitatively measured African ancestry, we demonstrate a major proportion of the racial disparity in MM is driven by disparity in the occurrence of the t(11;14), t(14;16), and t(14;20) types of MM.},

While a large number of well-maintained repositories of variation data exist, a systematic method to obtain information from different sources and collate them coherently toward prioritization of functional variants is the dire need of the hour. We begin this chapter with a brief classification of genomic variations and discuss the factors that govern such widespread variability, methods which are in practice to study genomic variations, and the potential uses of studying them. Moreover, we provide a short description of the different resources that have cataloged variation data and discuss the studies that have meaningfully annotated variations in specific contexts. We conclude the chapter by proposing strategies for variant prioritization, including how one should go about ascertaining the functionality of non-coding variants.},

 abstract = {This article discusses salafiyah in both history and conception. This is important to be studied further, because lately, especially in Indonesia there is an interesting phenomenon in which there is one group to identify themselves as salafi, slightly different from the mainstream of Muslims and claiming to be more strictly committed following the manhaj salaf al-sālih and the scholars which is in line with their understanding. One characteristic of this class is that it tends to be too strict in understanding religion so that it does not correspond to the wasatiyyah (mid) character of Islam. The consequence is that the exclusiveness shown by this group towards other Muslims, does not acknowledge the scholarly orbit of scholars outside the scholars who are inconsistent with their manhāj and consider their group alone who present the teachings of Islam in line with the understanding of the salaf. Another consequence is to easily mislead other Muslims when there is a difference between their understanding and the group. For this purpose, this paper attempts to retrace what is meant by the term salaf, the history of salafiyah development and some of the issues relating to first refer to its meaning on al-Qur’an, hadith, language and term.},

A cutting-edge synthesis of over two decades of scientific research, Urban Raptors is the first book to offer a complete overview of urban ecosystems in the context of bird-of-prey ecology and conservation. This comprehensive volume examines urban environments, explains why some species adapt to urban areas but others do not, and introduces modern research tools to help in the study of urban raptors. It also delves into climate change adaptation, human-wildlife conflict, and the unique risks birds of prey face in urban areas before concluding with real-world wildlife management case studies and suggestions for future research and conservation efforts. Boal and Dykstra have compiled the go-to single source of information on urban birds of prey. Among researchers, urban green space planners, wildlife management agencies, birders, and informed citizens alike, Urban Raptors will foster a greater understanding of birds of prey and an increased willingness to accommodate them as important members, not intruders, of our cities.},

 abstract = {This edited volume presents current archaeological research and data from the major early Acheulean sites in East Africa, and addresses three main areas of focus; 1) the tempo and mode of technological changes that led to the emergence of the Acheulean in East Africa; 2) new approaches to lithic collections, including lithic technology analyses; and 3) the debated coexistence of the Developed Oldowan and the early Acheulean. The chapters are the proceedings from the workshop titled “The Emergence of the Acheulean in East Africa”, held at University of Rome “La Sapienza” on September 12–13, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers currently working in this field in East Africa, in order to define the characteristics and the evolution of the early Acheulean. The volume was expanded with some chapters on the preceding Oldowan, on the African fauna and on paleovegetation, on the Acheulean in Asia and, eventually, on the Acheulean in Europe. The book is addressed to the scientific community, and will be of interest to researchers, graduate students, archaeologists, paleontologists, and paleoanthropologists. This volume is dedicated to the memory of Jean Chavaillon (March 25, 1925 - December 21, 2013), the leading archaeologist and Quaternary geologist who researched with unfailing enthusiasm the earliest human cultures and directed from 1965 to 1995 the French Archaeological Mission at Melka Kunture.},

 abstract = {Die ungeklärten Mysterien der Biologie Woher kommt das Leben? Warum schlafen wir? Wie können wir länger leben? Drei von sechs grundlegenden Fragen, die immer noch weitgehend offen sind und mit denen sich die moderne Biologie beschäftigt. Zu den ungelösten Mysterien zählen außerdem Evolution, Vererbung und Bewusstsein. Wie namhafte Wissenschaftler aus aller Welt versuchen, der Natur diese Geheimnisse Stück für Stück zu entlocken, beschreibt dieses Buch anhand ausgewählter Artikel aus den Zeitschriften "Spektrum der Wissenschaft" und "Gehirn&Geist". Meist sind es die Forscher selbst, die aus erster Hand ihre Beobachtungen und Entdeckungen schildern und somit Gelegenheit geben, ihnen über die Schulter zu schauen. Dabei sind sie sich längst nicht in allen Punkten einig. Der vorliegende Sammelband spiegelt den aktuellen Wissensstand, aber auch die zum Teil kontroversen Ansichten über die Wunder des Lebens wider. Andreas Jahn studierte Biologie an der Rheinisch Westfälischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen und forschte während seiner Promotion in Bremerhaven und Kiel über die Ökophysiologie von Meeresorganismen. In Hamburg ließ er sich zum Fachzeitschriftenredakteur ausbilden und arbeitete anschließend als Redakteur eines technischen Verlags bei Augsburg. Seit 2000 ist er Redakteur bei der Spektrum der Wissenschaft Verlagsgesellschaft in Heidelberg, zunächst in der Onlineredaktion, dann beim Magazin "Gehirn&Geist". 2018 wechselte er in die Heftredaktion von "Spektrum der Wissenschaft", wo er vor allem Themen aus Biologie und Medizin betreut.},

 abstract = {Microscopic analysis of butchering marks on bones from Neolithic to Hellenistic deposits at Çatalhöyük, Turkey, are employed as a proxy measure for identifying the rate and nature of adoption of metallurgy for quotidian activities. During the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, only stone tools were being used for butchering. In the post-Neolithic strata, however, chipped stone tools continue to dominate the assemblage. This stands in contrast to the larger regional pattern where metal butchering marks dominate after the end of the Early Bronze Age. The authors propose that the continued use of stone tools for processing animal carcasses long after the advent of hard metal alloys is because of the nearby and abundant source of obsidian. Obsidian flake and blade tools remain the raw material of choice for animal-carcass processing over time. The analysis demonstrates that the replacement of stone and adoption of metal butchering tools was not a straightforward affair.},

In this sympatric lifestyle, competition is hard and the synthesis of antibiotic molecules and/or antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is one solution that was developed by the organisms to survive. This environment becomes a large source of ARGs for pathogenic bacteria, leading to the risk of infection due to multidrug resistant bacteria. Culture and metagenomics are two complementary methods developed to study these microbiomes in order to better understand the type of bacteria and ARGs present in the human body, as well as the factors that modulate the abundance and variety of these ARGs. The objective of this review was to identify factors that influence the colonization and propagation of multidrug resistant bacteria and/or ARGs, and to define resistance genes and multidrug resistant bacteria that have already been isolated from the human microbiota using culturomics and metagenomics techniques.},

Recently, ancient DNA has brought new insights into European migration events linked to the advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of Indo-European languages. However, little is known about the ancient population history of north-eastern Europe, in particular about populations speaking Uralic languages, such as Finns and Saami. Here we analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals from Finland and north-western Russia. We show that the genetic makeup of northern Europe was shaped by migrations from Siberia that began at least 3500 years ago. This Siberian ancestry was subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region, particularly into populations speaking Uralic languages today. Additionally, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a larger territory during the Iron Age, which adds to the historical and linguistic information about the population history of Finland.},

Cet article présente une revue critique des différents critères considérés pour distinguer la chasse du charognage chez les hommes et les carnivores. Le gisement moustérien des Pradelles est analysé sur la base de cette synthèse. De cette étude, il ressort que l’impact anthropique sur les ossements décroît de la base au sommet de la séquence, les niveaux inférieurs correspondant à des sites d’habitat (au sens large) et les niveaux supérieurs à des tanières de carnivores. Dans l’ensemble inférieur, la capacité des Néandertaliens à chasser toutes les tailles d’ongulés est clairement établie. Cette étude souligne également la nécessité de diversifier les approches actualistes afin de documenter la complexité des gisements archéologiques. Enfin, elle permet de démontrer que la méthode des remontages préconisée par C.W. Marean (Bartram, Marean, 1999 ; Marean, 1998 ; Marean, Kim, 1998) pour la détermination des fragments diaphysaires n’est pas toujours nécessaire pour la distinction de la chasse et du charognage sur des ensembles osseux fortement ravagés par les carnivores, la détermination des restes de diaphyses au moyen de critères morphologiques étant, dans la plupart des cas, largement suffisante.},

 abstract = {In many archaeological assemblages, the presence of traces made by humans and made by carnivores on faunal assemblages raises the question of the respective roles played by these two agents in the accumulation and mo- dification of the bones. This article presents a critical review of the different criteria taken into consideration in distinguishing between hunting and scavenging by men and by carnivores. The Mousterian site of Les Pradelles is analysed on the basis of this synthesis. From this study, it emerges that the anthropic impact on bones decreases from the base to the summit of the stratigraphical sequence, lower levels corresponding to sites of habitat (in a very broad sense) and upper levels corresponding to carnivore dens. In the lower sequence, the capacity of Nean- dertals to hunt all sizes of ungulates is clearly demonstrated. This study also shows the necessity of diversifying actualistic approaches in order to document the complexity of archaeological deposits. Finally, it indicates that the refitting method recommended by C. W. Marean (Bartram & Marean, 1999; Marean, 1998; Marean & Kim, 1998) for the determination of shaft fragments is not always necessary for the distinction between hunting and scavenging in assemblages of bones extensively ravaged by carnivores, the determination of shaft fragments using morphological criteria being, in most cases, largely sufficient.},

The Yora are a small group of Panoan-speaking people inhabiting the upper Manu and Mishagua rivers in southeastern Peru, first contacted in 1984. The Yora provide a venue for such study: although they practice horticulture, they depend on subsistence foraging and continue to live in small kin-based groups with little access to Western medicine, contraception, or mechanized technology. The Yora household is assumed to be a primary venue for investment. Although Yora children had ample leisure time and relatively few household responsibilities, they nevertheless spent significant time foraging.},

 abstract = {Cases of racism have occurred in the early days of the emergence of Islam, which later became the political legitimacy in which in the leadership space in the Arabian Peninsula the tribe of Quraish is a tribe that dominates. This is reinforced by the argument of hadith which became the basis of that legitimacy. Nonetheless, in fact, there are many other propositions that seem quite contrary to the proposition, such as the Qur’an and other hadith. Therefore, the hadith about political racism which in this case about the domination of tribal leadership of Quraish becomes important to be reinterpreted by using hermeneutic point of view and contextualization of hadith. With this view, the election of a leader is not based on a particular tribe, although assessing of the leadership qualities of the future leader as well as his responsibility in carrying out the mandate of the leader. In the context of Indonesian, the dominance of a tribe in political space is controlled by the political interest of various circles, such as political elites and radical groups. The view that political domination held by a particular group is only used as a “scapegoat” to overthrow the political opponents.},

 abstract = {The need to apply sinkhole remediation and monitoring programs is increasing, concurrently with the rising engineering impacts of sinkholes in many regions. However, there is a significant gap in the scientific literature regarding the assessment of the performance of remedial works through subsidence monitoring. Monitoring techniques have experienced significant advances in the last few years thanks to the advent of new technologies. This work presents a review of sinkhole monitoring methods and discusses some practical considerations about their capabilities and limitations. It also documents a monitoring program (high-precision leveling and terrestrial laser scanner) and the concurrent remedial works (cement-based and polyurethane grouting) carried out in a highly active sinkhole that affects a flood-control dike and the adjacent village of Alcalá (NE Spain). The subsidence activity in the sinkhole is characterised by progressive sagging and the development of catastrophic nested collapses. Monitoring data reveal subsidence expansion and acceleration in the sector of the dike treated by polyurethane grouting above the main cavities. In contrast, subsequent cement-based grouting of the large cavities significantly reduced subsidence rates. Displacement data also indicate substantial subsidence enhancement following flood recession and the associated water table drop (buoyancy loss). This case study illustrates that high-precision leveling and terrestrial laser scanning are adequate complementary methods for monitoring specific sinkholes, characterised by very high accuracy and detailed spatial resolution, respectively.},

The parent generation seeks to cultivate pro‐social values in their children as this would improve their material well‐being when they grow up as cooperative adults. I show that communities endowed with more productive resources have a stronger incentive to teach their children social cooperation. Thus, there is a correlation between a village's level of material well‐being and villagers’ steady‐state level of pro‐socialness. When the cost of moral education is directly dependent on the parent generation's level of pro‐socialness, the multiplicity of steady states may emerge. If a community's initial level of pro‐socialness is high, the system will reach an interior steady state; in contrast, if this initial level is low, eventually the level of pro‐socialness will approach zero in the long run. Thus communities that start with similar initial levels of pro‐socialness may end up at drastically different steady states.},

 abstract = {Humans are the only primates that maintain regular inter-group relationships and meta-group social networks that enable the inter-group flow of individuals. This is the basis of the band/tribe concept in the anthropology of modern foragers. The present work is a theoretical approach to the development of analytical tools to understand group size and the temporal scale of site occupation in the archaeological record. We selected FLK Zinj as one of the oldest examples of a taphonomically-supported anthropogenic site in which both variables (group size and time) could be modelled using a combination of modern forager regression estimates from their camp sizes and estimates derived from the combined use of modern African foragers' meat consumption rates per day per capita during the dry season and minimum estimates of flesh yields provided by the carcass parts preserved at FLK Zinj. This approach provides the basis for a testable hypothesis which should be further tested in other Oldowan sites. An estimate of 18-28 individuals occupying FLK Zinj was made, which is similar to the estimated 16 individuals of one of the 1.5 Ma Ileret Homo erectus footprint trails. It also shows a similar proportional distribution to Dunbar's equations (group size to neocortex ratio) as documented in modern foragers, which suggest that most of the social network of H. erectus was in the meta-group level as is the case of modern foragers. Irrespective of the range of variation discussed for both variables (group size and length of time represented), it is argued that neither small estimates of time nor small group sizes can account for the formation of FLK Zinj.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of age and sex on physical activity and time budgets of Hadza children and juveniles, 5-14 years old, including both in-camp and out-of-camp activities.
METHODS: Behavioral data were derived from ~15 000 hourly in-camp scan observations of 76 individuals and 13 out-of-camp focal follows on nine individuals. The data were used to estimate energy expended and percentage of time engaged in a variety of routine activities, including food collection, childcare, making and repairing tools, and household maintenance.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that (1) older children spend more time in economic activities; (2) females spend more time engaged in work-related and economic activities in camp, whereas males spend more time engaged in economic activities out of camp; and (3) foraging by both sexes tends to net caloric gains despite being energetically costly.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, among the Hadza, a sexual division of labor begins to emerge in middle childhood and is well in place by adolescence. Furthermore, foraging tends to provide net caloric gains, suggesting that children are capable of reducing at least some of the energetic burden they place upon their parents or alloparents. The findings are relevant to our understanding of the ways in which young foragers allocate their time, the development of sex-specific behavior patterns, and the capacity of children's work efforts to offset the cost of their own care in a cooperative breeding environment.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                  With sharing economy and access-based consumption, consumers increasingly access goods through social access modes other than private ownership—such as co-ownership, leasing, or borrowing. Prior research focuses on consumers’ attitudinal motivations and consumption-cultural use experiences pertaining to such social exchange–based access modes. In so doing, prior research has overlooked the influence that consumers’ fundamental, even biologically shaped, cognitive traits may have on their choice of access modes. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes a data set of more than 30,000 new car registrations by male consumers in Finland, including cognitive test data from the Finnish Defense Forces and covariates from other governmental sources. The field data suggests that consumers’ intelligence scores and their choice to co-own and lease their cars are positively associated. Econometric evidence further suggests that the association between intelligence and choice of social exchange–based access modes can be explained by intelligent consumers’ higher social trust in people and institutions, as well as two circumstantial mechanisms: their financial standing and tendency to seek savings. The findings from the field data are supported by an additional survey study (n = 460). Implications for the evolution of markets and consumption, as well as human intelligence and cooperation, are discussed.},

The concept of the Qur’an regarding the best nafs is to refer to the human side in a potentially good way, resulting in good behavior. In the sense of a positive nafs who can always control himself from his desires to goodness. Not a few verses in the Qur’an that encourage humans to maintain the sanctity of lust and not dirty it. And it can be concluded that humans are endowed with nafs by Allah, with the nafs that humans can live to function as they should. With nafs, man works. And with the nafs is human worship},

 abstract = {The domestication of plants and animals initiated major changes in human ecology. The creation of novel micro-environments by human interference led in some cases to closer contact with disease vectors, such as mosquitoes carrying malaria or rats carrying plague-infected fleas. Turning to the fossils the most interesting in relation to human evolution are the Australopithecinae recovered from early Pleistocene deposits in South and East Africa. Apart from the direct effects on nutrition, the change from food collecting to food production obviously involved a host of secondary changes in human ecology and these may have greatly altered the nature and magnitudes of evolutionary selective pressures to which human populations were exposed. J. Yudkin has raised the interesting question of the factors determining food choice and the possibility that man retains an innate predilection for certain kinds of food. Obviously human diets are immensely varied and the things which are regarded as fit to eat differ greatly from one culture to another.},

 abstract = {Although the concept of culture was severely criticized in the second half of the twentieth century, its explanatory use has not been abandoned. Evolutionary psychologists and cognitive scientists have more recently used the concept in models and theories of culture. This use renews the hope that the concept of culture can be explanatorily useful within the social sciences, especially since the new definition of culture connects with both the idea of evolution and with the other natural sciences. In this paper, I analyze the models of cultural evolution developed by Cultural Evolutionary Science (CES), more specifically gene-culture coevolution theoretical models and dual-inheritance theories. I argue that even if CES scholars mostly claim that for them, culture is equal to information, some of these models have aspirations to bring back cultures as discrete units that resemble the social anthropological models of culture that have been already abandoned. I discuss evolutionists’ and social anthropologists’ objections to these models. I claim that despite the popularity of cultural evolutionist theories, social scientists (cultural anthropologists and historians, for example) should remain skeptical about the possibility that this approach can assume an explanatory role for a concept of culture.},

 abstract = {The dominance of red deer in Magdalenian records in Cantabrian Spain is a well-studied issue. Given the great accumulations of this species in those deposits, researchers have offered diverse interpretations of the phenomenon, related to ecology, orography or ethology. However, fewer papers carry out comparative intra-site analysis, which is able to document the existence of changes or continuities in the subsistence strategies at an archaeological site. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the archaeozoological analysis of Levels F and G in El Cierro cave (Asturias, Spain), both of them dated during Greenland Stadial 2, in the Lower Magdalenian (15,460 ± 75 and 15,580 ± 75 BP, respectively). Similar percentages of mammals have been documented in the two levels, as well as the same meat and fat consumption and processing strategies. Thus, this paper intends to determine how much energy red deer supplied to the diet of the humans that inhabited El Cierro, in comparison with other hunted and consumed fauna during the Lower Magdalenian. This study highlights the continuity of exploitation patterns of faunal resources in El Cierro cave during the Lower Magdalenian. This continuity is specifically seen in red deer, since the geographic characteristics of the Sella Valley, the abundance of the biotype, and the economic profitability of this species made it the main resource of animal origin for the hunter-gatherers at that site.},

 abstract = {Pastoralists rely on networks of cooperating households containing relatives and others to help with production and various other daily activities. To understand how socioecological differences and commonalities affect different social networks, we compared cooperative decision-making using gift games for 755 people working in herding groups across six sites in two countries (Saami areas in Norway and Tibetan areas in China). We found that members of the same herding group received more gifts from each other. Most variance in gift-giving between study sites was due to differences in the effects of relatedness. Tibetan herders were more likely than Saami herders to give gifts to closer relatives belonging to geographically distant herding groups. Also, stated reasons of giving gifts were different in the two societies: kin and wealth (measured by herd size) were more important among Tibetan pastoralists, while reciprocity was more important among Saami. Social ties within and beyond the family as well as the centrality of herding groups within social networks are general patterns of social organization favoring cooperation among pastoralists.Significance statementPastoralists around the world have independently developed social institutions built around cooperative herding units, known as siidas in Norway and ru skor in China. Our study investigates how kin and non-kin, in the same herding group or belonging to other groups, are associated with cooperation. Our results show that communities in both countries exhibit similar social pattern in terms of who they chose to give gifts to, despite differences in socioeconomic status and culture. Most of the variance in cooperation occurred between sites, primarily due to the effect of kinship. Members of the same herding group were preferred recipients of gifts, regardless of kinship, although closer kin were more likely to receive gifts. The stated reasons for giving were different in the two sites: siidas prioritized reciprocity whereas ru skor preferred kin and less wealthy herders. We discuss that ecology should be taken into consideration in understanding social behaviors, even if under similar subsistence system.},

For many years, differences in bone density according to element and variations in animal size have been considered conditioning factors for many taphonomic processes. While several studies highlight how animal size and density affect fracture patterns and bone preservation rates, variations in cut mark morphology are yet to be confronted against these variables. Here, we assess the effect of these variables and their potential effect on cut mark morphology by comparing a considerable amount of cut marks on different anatomical elements of both suids and bovids. Experimentally produced cut mark samples were then digitally reconstructed using a David Laser scanner that allowed the statistical analysis of each cut mark's shape and form. Geometric morphometric analysis using 2D and 3D landmark models were unable to find substantial differences in cut mark morphologies caused by either element type of carcass size.},

 abstract = {Domestication of dogs from wolves is the oldest known example of ongoing animal selection, responsible for generating more than 300 dog breeds worldwide. In order to investigate the taxonomic and functional evolution of the canine gut microbiota, a multi-omics approach was applied to six wild wolves and 169 dog faecal samples, the latter encompassing 51 breeds, which fully covers currently known canine genetic biodiversity. Specifically, 16S rRNA gene and bifidobacterial Internally Transcribed Spacer (ITS) profiling were employed to reconstruct and then compare the canine core gut microbiota to those of wolves and humans, revealing that artificial selection and subsequent cohabitation of dogs with their owners influenced the microbial population of canine gut through loss and acquisition of specific bacterial taxa. Moreover, comparative analysis of the intestinal bacterial population of dogs fed on Bones and Raw Food (BARF) or commercial food (CF) diet, coupled with shotgun metagenomics, highlighted that both bacterial composition and metabolic repertoire of the canine gut microbiota have evolved to adapt to high-protein or high-carbohydrates intake. Altogether, these data indicate that artificial selection and domestication not only affected the canine genome, but also shaped extensively the bacterial population harboured by the canine gut.},

 abstract = {The nutritional developmental origins of inflammatory bowel disease[s] (IBDs: Crohn's disease or Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) and their diet-based treatments continue to receive increasing attention. There is growing evidence for the success of nutrition-based treatments, such as exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] and the specific carbohydrate diet [SCD], in both paediatric and adult patients. Beyond these two dietary interventions, symptomatic benefit in IBD has also been shown from a gluten-free diet [GFD] and paleolithic diet [PALEO], among others. These nutritional therapies may point to critical factors in not only the pathology, but also the pathogenesis of the disease group. It is difficult, however, to discern a common element within the large number of diet-based causation theories [e.g. emulsifiers, processed foods, refrigeration, increased total fat intake, low fibre intake, carbohydrate dominant food, etc.] and the varied dietary treatments of IBD. This Viewpoint article highlights that carbohydrate variation links diet-based causation theories, and that carbohydrate monotony or persistence is the commonly shared characteristic of diet-based IBD therapy. Further research directed towards carbohydrate monotony may critically advance the prevention and treatment of these highly morbid conditions.},

 abstract = {Protozoa have long been considered undesirable residents of the human gut, but recent findings suggest that some of them may positively affect the gut ecosystem. To better understand the role and ecological dynamics of these commensal and potentially beneficial protozoan symbionts, we need efficient methods to detect them, as well as accurate estimates of their prevalence across human populations. Metagenomics provides such an opportunity, allowing simultaneous detection of multiple symbionts in a single analytical procedure. In this study, we collected fecal samples of 68 individuals from three Cameroonian populations with different subsistence modes and compared metagenomics-based and targeted methods of detection for two common protozoan genera: Blastocystis and Entamoeba. In addition, we analyzed our data along with publicly available fecal metagenomes from various worldwide populations to explore the prevalence and association patterns of ten protozoan genera. Regarding the detection method, microscopy was much less sensitive than metagenomics for Entamoeba, whereas qPCR was at least as sensitive as metagenomics for Blastocystis sp. However, metagenomics was more likely to detect co-colonizations by multiple subtypes. Out of the ten examined genera in 127 individuals from Cameroon, Tanzania, Peru, Italy or USA, only three (Blastocystis, Entamoeba and Enteromonas) had an overall prevalence exceeding 10%. All three genera were more common in less industrialized populations and their prevalence differed between continents and subsistence modes, albeit not in a straightforward manner. The majority (72.5%) of colonized individuals carried at least two protozoan species, indicating that mixed-species colonizations are common. In addition, we detected only positive and no negative association patterns between different protozoa. Despite the pitfalls of the metagenomic approach, ranging from the availability of good-quality sequencing data to the lack of standard analytical procedures, we demonstrated its utility in simultaneous detection of multiple protozoan genera, and especially its ability to efficiently detect mixed-species colonizations. Our study corroborates and expands prevalence results previously obtained for Blastocystis sp. and provides novel data for Entamoeba spp. and several other protozoan genera. Furthermore, it indicates that multiple protozoa are common residents of the healthy human gut worldwide.},

A complex history of migration follows Samoa’s initial peopling; first with populations sharing ancestry with Papuan-speaking groups and more recently with Europeans, Africans, and East Asians due to European colonialism. Using 1,197 Samoan high coverage whole genomes, we identify population splits between the major Samoan islands, and detect asymmetrical gene flow to the capital city. Approximately, 25% of Samoan genomes come from Papuan related ancestry, which we find as the likely source of the archaic Denisovan haplotypes in Samoans. We also find that Samoans had an extreme bottleneck until about 1,000 years ago, followed by distinct expansions between the islands, and subsequent bottlenecks consistent with European colonization. These results give insights to an ongoing archaeological debate about the peopling of Samoa.},

 abstract = {“Collapse” is an engaging buzzword that captivates public interest; as such, the notion of demise remains a dominant theme in studies of ancient civilizations. Our textbooks teach that the Roman Empire and Han dynasty (to name a few oft-cited examples) crumbled, and some, like the Maya and the Harappan suddenly – if not mysteriously – disappeared. In this manner, studying archaeology is promoted as a basis of prognostication for our modern Anthropocene, the timeframe when human agency became ascendant and affected global change. Well established models of collapse suggested that cultural downfall was predicated by hydroclimate-driven ecological and environmental crises that were both unavoidable and insurmountable, and resulted in finite end-points like abandonments and disappearances. Such deterministic or apocalyptic notions of societal collapses are appealing and tidy, but incomplete narratives. Emerging research has moved beyond simplistic and linear interpretations of antiquity, invoking anthropological paradigms of continuity, social resilience and transformation, as well as new methodological approaches for resolving how cultures may have assimilated, or coped by strategic adaptation, migration, socio-political reorganization or technological innovation. Interpretations of geoarchaeological records in context of environmental reconstructions underscore themes raised by post-processual anthropologists, such as the need to view cultural change as a continuum through environmental changes. With these themes in mind, we link selected examples of modern studies of many regions with a special focus on North African drylands with archaeological records that provide contexts for reconstructing how cultures coped. Formal resilience theory, built on concepts that were originally borrowed from ecology, offers more realistic frameworks for reconstructions of the past that enable us to ask nuanced questions about sustainability strategies during political transitions, socio-political crisis events like warfare and disease, crop collapse, soil loss, extreme weather (including hurricanes, floods, droughts), and resource availability. Resilience and persistence of cultures is a given, and is inherent in the progressive study of ancient cultures and modern societies living in marginal environments, and facing hydroclimate change, overpopulation, and scarcity of resources.

The answer arrived at here is 406 independent language families (including language isolates); however, this number is relative, and factors that prevent us from arriving at a definitive number for the world’s language families are discussed. A full list of the generally accepted language families is presented, which eliminates from consideration unclassified (unclassifiable) languages, pidgin and creole languages, sign languages, languages of undeciphered writing systems, among other things. A number of theoretical and methodological issues fundamental to historical linguistics are discussed that have impacted interpretations both of how language families are established and of particular languages families, both of which have implications for the ultimate number of language families.},

 abstract = {Earth's climate experienced a major warming during the last interglacial period (Eemian, MIS 5e, LIG 128 to 114 ky). The rapid climate change altered ecosystems causing a geographical redistribution of flora and fauna. Due to the scarcity of archaeological sites representing this period, the effect of these events on the behavior of Neanderthal hunter-gatherers in Western Europe has been poorly understood. New evidence from a wellpreserved archaeological layer (XV) at Baume (cave) Moula-Guercy in Southeastern France, attributed to the optimum Eemian Interglacial, unparalleled on the European continent, allows us to consider the challenges Neanderthals faced as these new ecosystems and ecological communities formed. We argue that, on the European continent, the human population collapsed, maintaining itself only in a few regions. We further suggest that these environmental upheavals, including depletion of prey biomass at the beginning of the Upper Pleistocene, contributed to the rise of cannibalistic behavior in Neanderthals, as exhibited among remains found at the Baume Moula-Guercy.},

One could argue that the main problem lies in the difficulties of demonstrating meat storage archaeologically due to the lack of direct evidence. This paper represents an attempt to refine zooarchaeological methods for the recognition of meat preservation and storage at prehistoric sites. Drawing on the faunal assemblage from Kharaneh IV, an Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic aggregation site in eastern Jordan, this study demonstrates that a combination of taphonomic and contextual analyses alongside ethnographic information may indeed lead archaeologists to insights not directly available from the archaeological record. The empirical evidence presented here contributes to the archaeological visibility of meat preservation and storage, providing a clearer concept of the nature of these practices in pre-agricultural societies.},

 abstract = {Cut marks, scrape marks, knapping marks, percussion damage and engravings are examples of humanly produced modifications made on the surface of bones, antlers and/or teeth during defleshing, disarticulation, filleting, surface cleaning or when modifying these organic materials into objects and tools. These traces are direct indications of human activity and by studying how and why they were made, we can begin to understand a variety of past human behaviours. Consequently, over the last ten years we have observed an increase in the development of new analytical techniques to better understand the production, function, macro-, and micro-morphometric characteristics of bone modifications. In this study we present the application of multiple techniques to visualise and analyse the internal and external features of modified bone, teeth and antler. A Focus Variation Microscope (FVM), the Alicona InfiniteFocus optical surface measurement system, was used to examine the topography of surface modifications. This system produces 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, allowing evaluations of metric parameters (depth, width, area and volume) associated with different type of modifications. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), operated in variable pressure mode, was used to capture higher resolution images for better characterisation and identification of the modifications and finer details, which are not always visible using a FVM. The extension of an SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy allowed for elemental analyses of the modified surfaces, including the recognition of exogenous elements imbedded within the modifications. Finally, micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) was performed to record how extensively a modification can affect and alter the internal structure of organic specimens. Analyses of μCT data also help to visualise gross surface morphology when obscured by other material. Together these approaches provide in-depth assessments of bone taphonomy on both the inside and the outside, furthering our understandings of ancient human behaviours.},

In this light we present excavation results for Charcoal and Burnt Stone Feature #1 (CBS1) located within coastal dune sediments at Moyjil (Point Ritchie), Warrnambool, that independent geomorphic and OSL dating indicates is of Last Interglacial age (~120,000 years ago). While on plausibility grounds the cultural status of a feature of such great antiquity in Australia is unlikely, a cultural origin for CBS1 is less easily dismissed if assessed with an age-independent methodology. A broad range of macroscale discrimination criteria has been used to assess whether CBS1 is either a cultural hearth or a natural feature such as a burnt tree stump. On balance, evidence marginally supports a cultural origin over a natural origin. However, the absence of associated stone artefacts and faunal remains and the presence of burnt root wood precludes definitive statements on the cultural status of the feature. Our case study is methodologically instructivein terms of the potential complexities and issues of equifinality involved in the archaeological identification of ancient hearths.},

 abstract = {Hunting preferences reveal a great deal about the life of Paleolithic humans, and may reflect changes in human demography, technology, and adaptations to changing environments. However, the effects of hunting preferences and environmental availability are often conflated, stressing the need for comparisons to other predators that exploited the same environment. Manot Cave (Israel), preserved rich Early Upper Paleolithic (46-33 ka) human occupations, along with repeated spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) occupations, allowing us to compare anthropogenic and biogenic bone assemblages within the same space and time frame. We focused on the faunal remains retrieved in the middle of the cave (Area D), and conducted detailed taphonomic and zooarchaeological analyses. The Area D archaeofauna was dominated by Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), which showed high abundance of carnivore damage. This and the carnivore-to-ungulate ratio, the presence of juvenile hyena and numerous coprolites match the criteria of a hyena den, confirming that the bone assemblage was created mainly by hyenas. Manot Area D thus reveals hyena prey choice in the Upper Paleolithic Galilee, which we then compared with human prey choice. Our results showed that hyena prey assemblages in Manot and elsewhere in the Levant were Dama-dominated while human assemblages were dominated by Gazella, demonstrating that hyenas and humans hunted different animal size groups, possibly in different habitats. We interpret this phenomenon as resulting from two possible scenarios: the emergence of projectile technology which may favor hunting in open environments, and niche partitioning derived by human-hyena competition. Hyenas were abundant and hunted unselectively while the anthropogenic record presents population turnovers and some dietary diversification. Whereas both scenarios are difficult to test directly with the available evidence, we argue that either one explains quite well the late Pleistocene archaeofaunal patterns in the Levantine record.},

Analysts, thus, lose the opportunity to resolve an important part of the equifinality related to activities that hominins and different types of carnivores may produce. Recent studies have shown that the use of powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms allow the accurate classification of bone surface modifications (BSM). Here, we present an experimental study, applying these algorithms to the analysis of bone breakage patterns. This statistical methodology allows the correct classification of three different assemblages which have been generated anthropogenically and by the activity of carnivores (i.e., hyenas and wolves). ML algorithms applied to a multivariate set of properties of broken bone specimens yielded an accuracy of 95% and were higher in classifying agency without the need to include information from BSM. This paper proposes a methodological approach that opens the door to improve our understanding of referential frameworks regarding bone breakage and to determine agency in prehistoric bone breakage processes.},

 abstract = {Human activities typically lead to simplified urban diversity, which in turn reduces microbial exposure and increases the risk to urban dwellers from non-communicable diseases. To overcome this, we developed a microbial inoculant from forest and agricultural materials that resembles microbiota in organic soils. Three different sand materials (sieved, safety, and sandbox) commonly used in playgrounds and other public spaces were enriched with 5% of the inoculant. Skin microbiota on fingers (identified from bacterial 16S rDNA determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing) was compared after touching non-enriched and microbial inoculant-enriched sands. Exposure to the non-enriched materials changed the skin bacterial community composition in distinct ways. When the inoculant was added to the materials, the overall shift in community composition was larger and the differences between different sand materials almost disappeared. Inoculant-enriched sand materials increased bacterial diversity and richness but did not affect evenness at the OTU level on skin. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher after touching inoculant-enriched compared to non-enriched sand materials. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens on skin was 40-50% before touching sand materials, but dropped to 14 and 4% after touching standard and inoculant-enriched sand materials, respectively. When individual genera were analyzed, <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. and <i>Sphingomonas</i> sp. were more abundant after touching standard, non-enriched sand materials, while only the relative abundance of <i>Chryseobacterium</i> sp. increased after touching the inoculant-enriched materials. As <i>Chryseobacterium</i> is harmless for healthy persons, and as standard landscaping materials and normal skin contain genera that include severe pathogens, the inoculant-enriched materials can be considered safe. Microbial inoculants could be specifically created to increase the proportion of non-pathogenic bacterial taxa and minimize the transfer of pathogenic taxa. We recommend further study into the usability of inoculant-enriched materials and their effects on the bacterial community composition of human skin and on the immune response.},

The utility of this approach is demonstrated by exploring the example of anthropogenic space as a key context of human-bird figurations. Each contributing paper of the special issue, which will be introduced in more detail below, foregrounds different aspects and emphasises varying dimensions of the triangle, thus contributing in different ways to archaeo-ornithological research. As highlighted throughout the introduction, however, archaeo-ornithological approaches are not only capable of shedding new light on old questions about the past, they also have the potential of addressing some pressing contemporary quandaries, including continuing debates on the Anthropocene.},

Yet, it is one of the most debated and controversial issues in the field of Palaeolithic archaeology. The scientific community generally proposes that the regular and controlled use of fire occurred from 400 to 300 ka onward, and that the archaeological signal became well established in sites younger than 100 ka. Thus, the chronological range between 400 and 300 ka is crucial to exploring how this phenomenon and the associated behavioural changes occurred. Here, we examine the zooarchaeological signature this process left on the faunal record, including procurement techniques and animal processing (e.g., roasting). The data are compared to information from sites without fire that are framed within the same chronological period. Our objective is to collect zooarchaeological data on the process of dependence on fire as a central element in the new human mode of adaptation.},

 abstract = {Estimating Acheulian group sizes based on a fragmentary archaeological record is fraught with difficulties, more so in regions like India, where lithics form the primary source of information. Here, we review current approaches towards modeling group size in Indian archaeology. We then examine to what extent one may address issues related to seasonality, fission-fusion strategies and group size in the context of Acheulian sites, drawing on our research along the southeastern coast of India. We move between multiple scales of analysis: from the regional Acheulian archaeological record to specific studies at the site of Attirampakkam (ATM). We consider aspects of site distribution, sizes, artefact densities and Acheulian lithic reduction strategies, factoring in issues related to geomorphology, taphonomy and chronology. Acheulian hominins occupied the study region over the early to middle Pleistocene, and the fragmented lithic reduction sequence noted on landscape scales suggests diverse site functions structured by ease of access to quartzite raw material for large flake production in addition to other resources. In contrast to most sites, the absence of raw material at ATM necessitated groups to anticipate this, and organize their behavior on landscape scales, and on-site, to resolve this issue. We show how successive groups were attracted to the site over the early Pleistocene, potentially aiming at exploiting seasonally predictable biological resources in a riparian environment, knowledge of which was transmitted across generations. Considerations of the spatial and temporal variability in artefact densities across a vast site area, along with aspects of the lithic reduction sequences suggests a short-duration occupation by a potentially large group, possibly resulting from aggregation of several small groups as noted in some ethnographic examples of hunter-gatherer fission-fusion strategies. We show drastic changes in behavioral organization in the succeeding Middle Palaeolithic phases at the site and in the region.},

Bone modifications are assessed to inform selection and processing, and skeletal part frequencies are analyzed with utility indices developed for this species among the Nunamiut at Anaktuvuk Pass. Results confirm the accumulation of faunal remains resulted primarily from human subsistence activities in the middle to late Holocene that included nutritional uses for meat, marrow and grease as well as technology manufacturing. Statistical utility analyses point to a deposit of marrow and grease processing debris at an activity area and support these as enduring subsistence practices in this region. A previous study on a larger faunal sample from the site also indicated a range of economic uses of caribou but did not find significant results with utility indices. To explain this difference it is suggested that the faunal aggregates chosen for analysis in this and the previous study have influenced statistical outcomes. The results of this study hold implications for utility analysis as well as for interpretations of caribou use at archaeological sites in arctic, sub-arctic, and alpine tundra areas of the Northern Hemisphere where this species has been abundant.},

 abstract = {REDD+ projects primarily focus on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. These projects are regularly evaluated against their core objective of conserving carbon stocks, but their contribution to biodiversity conservation has rarely been assessed. To assess the conservation value of the area and the relative performance of a REDD+ land use plan in Yaeda Valley, a semi-arid savannah ecosystem in northern Tanzania, we implemented an annual wildlife monitoring scheme. Based on direct sightings and indirect signs of wildlife, obtained from stratified walking transects conducted annually from 2015-2018, we estimated annual trends of mammal species richness and wildlife densities in three REDD+ and three non-REDD+ land-use strata. Our surveys document a near complete mammal community in the area. Species accumulation curves, and subsequent statistical comparisons, indicated highest mammal species richness in the woodland habitats (both REDD+ and non REDD+ strata) as compared to more human and livestock impacted areas, and suggested constant species richness from 2015-2018. To estimate stratum- and year-specific livestock and wildlife densities (cattle, donkey, goat and sheep combined, Thomson's gazelle, Kirk's dik-dik) and wildlife sign densities (aardvark, bushbuck, bushpig, Kirk's dik dik, eland, elephant, Maasai giraffe, greater kudu, hyena, impala, lesser kudu, warthog, wildebeest, Plains zebra), we fitted species-specific detection functions in a distance sampling framework. Species-specific densities varied between 2015 and 2018 and showed substantial increases and occasional declines in other species-stratum combinations. However, population growth rates were not systematically associated with specific land-use strata. Although our results do not explicitly provide evidence that REDD+ land-use plans directly co-benefit wildlife conservation, they show that REDD+ areas have the potential to maintain intact wildlife assemblages. To ensure effective long-term conservation outcomes, we advocate for a more formal integration of wildlife conservation goals in the REDD+ scheme.},

In this study fibular/tibial strength was determined in KNM-WT 15000, a juvenile Homo erectus individual (1.5 Ma), and in OH 35, a Homo habilis (or possibly Paranthropus boisei) individual (1.8 Ma), and compared to that of adult modern humans (n = 79), chimpanzees (n = 16), gorillas (n = 16) and orangutans (n = 11). Ontogenetic changes in fibular/tibial strength were also analyzed due to KNM-WT 15000's juvenile status. Cross-sectional properties at midshaft were derived from multi-plane radiography and external contours, or CT scanning. Comparisons of log-transformed fibular/tibial polar second moment of area and anteroposterior (A-P) and mediolateral (M-L) second moments of area were carried out between extant species. Fossil deviations from each extant taxon's mean proportion were calculated in standard deviation (SD) units for that taxon. Great apes differ significantly from modern humans, with relatively stronger fibulae, particularly in the M-L plane. KNM-WT 15000 is more than 2 SD from all great apes (≥3 SD in the M-L plane) and within 1 SD of modern humans for almost all variables. This is not a result of its age, as fibular/tibial strength slightly decreases with age (i.e., becomes less like that of great apes) in humans. OH 35 falls within 1 SD of chimpanzees and orangutans for the majority of cross-sectional proportions, but more than 1 SD from humans. KNM-WT 15000 is demonstrated to be fully modern, complimenting other indications of complete terrestrial bipedality and possibly showing adaptations for endurance running. OH 35 has some human-like features; however, the relative strength of the two bones aligns the specimen with great apes, consistent with a significant degree of arboreality, in particular, vertical climbing.},

 abstract = {Southern African indigenous groups, traditionally hunter-gatherers (San) and herders (Khoekhoe), are commonly referred to as "Khoe-San" populations and have a long history in southern Africa. Their ancestors were largely isolated up until ∼2,000 years ago before the arrival of pastoralists and farmers in southern Africa. Assessing relationships among regional Khoe-San groups has been challenging due to admixture with immigrant populations that obscure past population affinities and gene flow among these autochthonous communities. We re-evaluate a combined genome-wide data set of previously published southern Africa Khoe-San populations in conjunction with novel data from Khoe-San individuals collected in Xade (Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Botswana) prior to their resettlement outside the reserve. After excluding regions in the genome that trace their ancestry to recent migrant groups, the genetic diversity of 20 Khoe-San groups fitted an isolation-by-distance model. Even though isolation-by-distance explained most genetic affinities between the different autochthonous groups, additional signals of contact between Khoe-San groups could be detected. For instance, we found stronger genetic affinities, than what would be explained by isolation-by-distance gene flow, between the two geographically separated Khoe-San groups, who speak branches of the Kx'a-language family (ǂHoan and Ju). We also scanned the genome-wide data for signals of adaptive gene flow from farmers/herders into Khoe-San groups and identified a number of genomic regions potentially introduced by the arrival of the new groups. This study provides a comprehensive picture of affinities among Khoe-San groups, prior to the arrival of recent migrants, and found that these affinities are primarily determined by the geographic landscape.},

Through the taphonomic study of bone assemblages, we have attempted to reconstruct the strategies, methods, and butchery practices in the exploitation of these game animals adopted by different cultural groups of Middle Palaeolithic hunters. Therefore, Neanderthal hunting behaviour has been examined using different proxies such as the choice of anatomical parts, selective transport of elements, prey selection, and age estimation. Results suggest bovines were an important subsistence resource in some cases, even if they were not the most exploited taxa in others, indicating differences and similarities depending on the context across the Italian peninsula. These results highlight additional aspects of Neanderthal landscape use and hunting strategies.},

 abstract = {During the medieval period, hundreds of thousands of Europeans migrated to the Near East to take part in the Crusades, and many of them settled in the newly established Christian states along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. Here, we present a genetic snapshot of these events and their aftermath by sequencing the whole genomes of 13 individuals who lived in what is today known as Lebanon between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries CE. These include nine individuals from the "Crusaders' pit" in Sidon, a mass burial in South Lebanon identified from the archaeology as the grave of Crusaders killed during a battle in the 13<sup>th</sup> century CE. We show that all of the Crusaders' pit individuals were males; some were Western Europeans from diverse origins, some were locals (genetically indistinguishable from present-day Lebanese), and two individuals were a mixture of European and Near Eastern ancestries, providing direct evidence that the Crusaders admixed with the local population. However, these mixtures appear to have had limited genetic consequences since signals of admixture with Europeans are not significant in any Lebanese group today-in particular, Lebanese Christians are today genetically similar to local people who lived during the Roman period which preceded the Crusades by more than four centuries.},

 abstract = {The intrasite mobility of lithic artifacts is one of the most relevant issues that can be approached from the spatial study of refitting. In many sites, researchers have determined that some artifacts were abandoned at a considerable distance from the place where they were produced. Once natural causes of a post-depositional nature are ruled out, the most likely hypothesis to explain these movements is intentional displacement by humans. However, the interpretation of such intentional movements is particularly difficult, since the intrasite mobility of lithic artifacts can be related to at least four different factors: (a) refuse disposal strategies, (b) functional complementarity between different activity areas, (c) social relations between different domestic units, and (d) recycling. Each of these factors has different implications concerning questions as important as the spatial organization within campsites or contemporaneity between activity areas. To address this issue, it is necessary to have a representative sample of transport episodes and to analyze aspects such as the connection length, the directionality of the movements, the type of artifacts transported, and the activities carried out both in the place of origin and in the place of destination. As an example, in this work, we analyze the long-distance displacements identified in different Middle Paleolithic levels from the Abric Romaní (Capellades, Spain).},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the estimated mutation age and conservation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with physical activity (PA) in humans. All human SNPs found to be significantly associated with PA levels in the literature were cross-referenced with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project to find estimated African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) mutation age. As a secondary measure of mutation age, SNPs were searched for in Hawk's mutation age prediction database which utilizes linkage equilibrium. To determine conservation among hominids, all SNPs were searched in the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser, which contains Neanderthal and chimpanzee reference genomes. Six of the 104 SNPs associated with PA regulation were exon-located missense variants found in IFNAR2, PPARGC1A, PML, CTBP2, IL5RA, and APOE genes. The remaining 98 SNPs were located in non-protein coding regions. Average AA and EA estimated mutation age of the exon-located SNPs were 478.4 ± 327.5 kya and 542.1 ± 369.4 kya, respectively. There were four selective sweeps (suggestive of strong positive selection) of SNPs in humans when compared to Neanderthal or chimpanzee genomes. Exon-located PA candidate SNPs are older than the hypothesized emergence of anatomically modern humans. However, 95% of PA associated SNPs are found in intron and intergenic location. Across all SNPs, there seems to be a high level of conservation of alleles between humans, Neanderthals, and chimpanzees. However, the presence of four selective sweeps suggests there were selection pressures or drift unique to Homo sapiens that influenced the development of mutations associated with PA regulation.},

 abstract = {Artificial light has reshaped human sleep/wake cycle in industrial societies and raised concern on the misalignment of this cycle relative to the light and dark cycle. This manuscript contrasts sleep timing in extratropical, industrial societies (data from eight national time use surveys in countries with Daylight Saving Time —DST— regulations) and Subtropical, pre-industrial societies with and without access to artificial light (data from nine locations coming from seven previous reports) against the cycle of light and dark. Within the two process model of sleep, results show sleep onset and sleep offset keep bound to each other by the homeostatic process. In winter, the photoreceptive process aligns the phase of the sleep/wake cycle to sunrise. As a result the phase increasingly lags with increasing latitude up to a delay of 120 min at 55° latitude. In summer, the homeostatic process still binds sleep onset to speep offset but DST rules in industrialized societies reduce the lag by one third to 40 min at 55° latitude. Sleep timing is then stationary with latitude. The phase of the sleep/wake cycle is then governed by natural trends and no clues of misalignment are revealed.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Kit-based assays, such as Absolute IDQ ™ p150, are widely used in large cohort studies and provide a standardized method to quantify blood concentrations of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). Many disease-relevant associations of PCs were reported using this method. However, their interpretation is hampered by lack of functionally relevant information on the detailed fatty acid side chain compositions as only the total number of carbon atoms and double bonds is identified by the kit. To enable more substantiated interpretations, we characterized these PC sums using the side chain resolving Lipidyzer™ platform, analyzing 223 samples in parallel to the Absolute IDQ ™. Combining these datasets, we estimated the quantitative composition of PC sums and subsequently tested their replication in an independent cohort. We identified major constituents of 28 PC sums, revealing also various unexpected compositions. As an example, PC 16:0_22:5 accounted for more than 50% of the PC sum with in total 38 carbon atoms and 5 double bonds (PC aa 38:5). For 13 PC sums, we found relatively high abundances of odd-chain fatty acids. In conclusion, our study provides insights in PC compositions in human plasma, facilitating interpretation of existing epidemiological datasets and potentially enabling imputation of PC compositions for future meta-analyses of lipidomics data. },

 abstract = {Different agents can lead to similar damage patterns, and different causes can result in the same type of modification. This phenomenon was defined by Lyman (1987) as a problem of equifinality, with which the researcher warned about the risks of making direct systematic correlations. The fact that a specific type of damage cannot be linked to a single actor, behaviour or ecological context is primarily applicable to damage associated with the direct consumption of carcasses. Some carnivores show physical and dental characteristics that could lead to bone modifications potentially like those generated by humans. For example, bears have a bunodont dentition and plantigrade locomotion –the latter allows them to frequently release and use their claws as “hands”. Here, we present the neo-taphonomical study of 17 ungulate carcasses eaten by wild brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos) in the Spanish Pyrenees. Our observations express this equifinal problem due to the similarities between tooth marks and peeling generated by both bears and humans. This fact is especially significant, given that peeling and the combination of this damage with visible tooth marks were primarily associated with the feeding activities of humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and only anecdotally with other taphonomic agents, such as spotted hyenas. With this research, we try to show some equifinal phenomena that could occur in Pleistocene faunal assemblages as well, where the presence of both hominids and bears is documented.},

 abstract = {Humans and other animals appear to defy many principles of economic 'rationality' when making decisions. Here, we use an ecological rationality framework to examine patterns of decision-making across species to illuminate the origins of these strategies. We argue that examples of convergent evolution-the independent emergence of similar traits in species facing similar environments-can provide a crucial test for evolutionary theories of decision-making. We first review theoretical work from evolutionary biology proposing that many economically-puzzling patterns of decision-making may be biologically adaptive when considering the environment in which they are made. We then focus on convergence in ecology, behavior, and cognition of apes and capuchin monkeys as an example of how to apply this ecological framework across species. We review evidence that wild chimpanzees and capuchins, despite being distantly related, both exploit ecological niches characterized by costly extractive foraging and risky hunting behaviors. We then synthesize empirical studies comparing these species' decision preferences. In fact, both capuchins and chimpanzees exhibit high tolerance for delays in inter-temporal choice tasks, as well as a preference for risky outcomes when making decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, these species exhibit convergent psychological mechanisms for choices, including emotional responses to decision outcomes and sensitivity to social context. Finally, we argue that identifying the evolutionary pressures driving the emergence of specific decision strategies can shed light into the adaptive nature of human economic preferences.},

 abstract = { At Elandsfontein, a Middle Pleistocene marsh deposit preserves an abundance of mammalian fossils, along with a partial cranium of Homo heidelbergensis and a significant number of Acheulean stone tools. Most of this material was collected from the surface of eroding deposits in the 20th century, and it seemed to derive from a combination of hominin foraging activities and other, natural processes. Prior archaeological research on the fossil collection has emphasized natural, carnivore-related mortality and accumulation of large ungulates and downplayed the potential role of hominin hunting or scavenging at the marsh and more broadly at this time period in human evolution (Klein et al., 2007). Here, reanalysis of the most abundant large bovid taxa yields new, comprehensive estimates of the minimum number of individual (MNI) bovids and their age at death. The MNI = 125 for six species of size group 3 bovids, and the MNI = 37 for one species of size group 4 bovid. Analysis of these mortality profiles on triangular graphs reveals a consistent living-structure (i.e., catastrophic) profile for the pooled size group 3 taxa but an attritional profile for the size group 4 taxon. These results are contrary to prior reports for the collection, and they may indicate a larger role for hunting by H. heidelbergensis than heretofore reconstructed. The Elandsfontein mortality profiles, when compared to older and younger profiles from Stone Age and modern contexts in Africa and Europe, indicate more broadly that capable ambush hunting of large ungulate prey occurred throughout the past two million years of evolution of the genus Homo.},

                In the brain, increased neural activity is correlated with an increase of cerebral blood flow and increased tissue oxygenation. However, how cerebral oxygen dynamics are controlled in the behaving animals remains unclear. Here, we investigated to what extent the cerebral oxygenation varies during natural behaviors that change the whole-body homeostasis, specifically exercise. We measured oxygen levels in the cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during locomotion using polarography, spectroscopy, and two-photon phosphorescence lifetime measurements of oxygen sensors. We found that locomotion significantly and globally increases cerebral oxygenation, specifically in areas involved in locomotion, as well as in the frontal cortex and the olfactory bulb. The oxygenation increase persisted when neural activity and functional hyperemia were blocked, occurred both in the tissue and in arteries feeding the brain, and was tightly correlated with respiration rate and the phase of respiration cycle. Thus, respiration provides a dynamic pathway for modulating cerebral oxygenation.},

@article{pub.1115086197,
 abstract = {In hunter-gatherer societies such as the Inuit and the San, hunters are frequently observed giving their food to others voluntarily or in response to demands. Such behavior is called "food sharing". Cultural anthropologists regard food sharing practices as a characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies. Studies of food sharing have emphasized 1) its origins, 2) its effects or functions, 3) its features and forms and 4) changes it experiences. In food sharing studies, many anthropologists, such as Service (1966), regard the food sharing practices of hunter-gatherers as a form of exchange based on "generalized reciprocity", following Sahlins' concept of "reciprocity" (Sahlins 1965). In this paper, I first review several anthropological studies on different forms of food sharing to illustrate some serious limitations to the concept of "reciprocity" as applied to food sharing. I then propose a new typology of food sharing for classification, description, and comparison. Finally, I examine the usefulness of the new typology by analyzing food sharing among two Inuit groups of the Canadian Arctic, one the Akulivik Inuit and the other the Clyde River Inuit. Through the review of prior studies, it is evident that until now various food-sharing behaviors have been categorized under one heading only: food sharing. If we focus on the ways sharing is initiated (by rule, voluntary, or on demand) and the flow of food (transfer, exchange, or re-distribution), we can theoretically show the following nine types of sharing forms: transfer by rule, voluntary transfer, transfer on demand, exchange by rule, voluntary exchange, exchange on demand, re-distribution by rule, voluntary re-distribution and re-distribution on demand. I applied this new typology to the Inuit cases of the Canadian Arctic for description and analysis in this paper. As a result, I found that transfer and re-distribution are more prominent characteristics of Inuit food sharing than exchange. Also, that demand sharing is not emphasized among the Inuit in Canada. I argue that with the nine types of food sharing, we can describe, analyze and compare almost all kinds of food sharing practices in hunter-gatherer societies. Furthermore, this typology may be extended to apply to the study of the sharing of food, money, goods or services in small-scale societies and to the study of food sharing in non-hunter-gather human groups in the world.},

 abstract = {Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), one of humankinds’ closest living relatives, are known to hunt and consume the meat of various animal taxa. Although some researchers have presented indirect evidence that chimpanzees may also prey on tortoises, until now, direct observations of this behaviour did not exist. Here, we provide systematic descriptions of the first observations of chimpanzee predation on tortoises (Kinixys erosa). We made these unprecedented observations on newly habituated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) of the Rekambo community, living in the Loango National Park, Gabon. The behaviour qualified as customary, that is occurring in most or all adult males, involved a distinct smashing technique, and resulted frequently in food sharing with other group members. Our observations shed new light on the hitherto little understood percussive technology of chimpanzees, and expand our current knowledge on chimpanzees’ dietary and predatory repertoires with respect to reptiles. We also report a case of food storage and discuss it in the context of future-oriented cognition. Our findings suggest the need for more nuanced interpretations of chimpanzees’ cognitive skills in combination with an in-depth understanding of their unique socio-ecological niches. They further emphasize the importance of nonhuman primate field observations to inform theories of hominin evolution.},

The most classic and popular example may be the classification of societies into such general types as follows (FIRTH, 1953) I Food-gatherers, hunters, and fishers. II Pastoralists. III Agriculturalists. IV Artisans. Another example is the classification of primitive economies into such major types as follows (JACOBS and STERN, 1948) I. Hunting, fishing, food-gathering economies a . that lacked exchangeable surpluses. These will be designated as simple food-gathering economies. b . that produced small exchangeable surpluses. These will be referred to as advanced food-gathering economies. II. Economies based on primitive agriculture, or on pastoralism, or on primitive agriculture and pastoralism a . that lacked pastoralism and produced small surpluses. These will be referred to as simple agricultural economies. b . with or without pastoralism and that produced large surpluses. These will be referred to as advanced agricultural or agricultural-pastoral economies. These classifications all were based on the ways of food-getting or the patterns of food-economies. In short, these were the classifications of food-getting activities from the economic point of view. Traditional anthropological-ethnological studies lacked perspectives on the diversity of human food habit. Animals are classified according to the food habit or dietary habit into such major types as herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Man's food habit also varies greatly. Moreover, it is one of the fundamental problems on hominization and human evolution. From this point of view, a systematic study of man's food habit may be necessary. Ethnographic reports show that there is a wide variation in food habits among hunter-gatherers ; however, there has been no systematic study of it. My point is to discuss a possibility of systematically studying the diversity of hunter-gatherers' food habits on the basis of available ethnographic data. What will be attempted here is the classification on their food habits from an ecological-evolutionary point of view. It means that the criteria for the classfication are selected from among those which are significant from an ecological or evolutionary point of view. The most important and fundamental criterion adopted here is the staple food or principal element of the diet of a given people. The second major criterion is the relative size of animals which are hunted. The reason for this is that a distinction between small animals and larger animals is necessary if we are to discuss hunter-gatherers' food habits from the view point of hominization. The third essential criterion of this classification system is a distinction between land animals and aquatic animals as the principal food of a given people, which is significant from the view point of the dispersal of man and the evolution of human food habit. Through the criteria of food habits, modern hunter-gatherers can be classified into three major types and four subtypes as indicated in Figs. 3 and 4. Among hunter-gatherers, there are two extreme types. One is characterized by a strong vegetarian habit and is designated here as the vegetarians or plant-eaters (Type I) . An important subsidiary criterion of this group is underdeveloped hunting characterized by adult males as part-time hunters.},

 abstract = { Anthropologists often assert that modern hunter-gatherer societies have been relegated to marginal habitats compared to their agricultural neighbors, with the implication that modern social organization and behavior provide little insight into Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. We refer to this idea as the marginal habitat hypothesis (MHH). Despite widespread use of the term ‘marginal,’ there is little consensus as to what comprises a low quality habitat for humans. Here we reassess the MHH by comparing the net primary productivity (NPP) of habitats occupied by, and the population density (PD) of, a sample of 186 pre-industrial societies (foragers, horticulturalists, intensive agriculturalists, and pastoralists). We found that the nature of the NPP-PD relationship varied by subsistence type, and that foragers did not occupy significantly lower net primary productivity habitats compared to other subsistence types. These results do not support the MHH. We conclude by discussing the limitations of using modern ethnographic datasets to address the MHH and suggest alternative ways in which it may still be relevant.},

@article{pub.1115982526,
 abstract = {The expensive brain hypothesis predicts that the lowest stable level of energy input sets the upper limit to a species’ brain size. This prediction receives comparative support from the effects of experienced seasonality (including hibernation) and diet quality on mammalian brain size. Here, we test another prediction, which concerns the temporal stability of energy inputs. Allomaternal care in mammals can be provided by breeding males or other helpers (usually earlier offspring). Male care should be stable and reliable since otherwise no breeding would occur. Care by others, in contrast, should fluctuate, as the availability of helpers often varies. One would therefore predict, other things being equal, that the presence of male care in addition to maternal care should show positive correlated evolution with brain size, whereas care by others would not. However, because females can readily respond through litter size adjustments to variable amounts of energy inputs, helper inputs may be used to increase fertility. A detailed comparative analysis of a large sample of mammals (N = 478 species) showed that male help is correlated with the evolution of larger brains, whereas alloparental help is correlated with higher fertility, but only in species where male care is also present (as in cooperative breeders). Humans evolved an unusual form of multi-family cooperative breeding, which involves stable and reliable care by both fathers and alloparents. This combination helps to explain why humans differ from the other apes in having both an extremely large brain and a relatively high reproductive output.Significance statementAllomaternal care provides breeding females with energy, directly or indirectly, and so would be expected to affect fertility and/or brain size. Which path evolution actually took remains controversial, partly because previous studies did not separate between care provided by the breeding male (paternal care) and care by non-breeding helpers (alloparental care). We distinguish between them because we expect that selection only favours increased brain size if the increase in energy available to the female is predictable and constant. Using a sample of 478 mammals, we show that paternal care, which is both reliable and stable, shows correlated evolution with brain size, whereas alloparental care, which fluctuates with varying availability of helpers, is correlated with higher fertility. Thus, constraints on brain size, imposed by its high-energy costs, may predict brain size better than the fitness benefits of improved cognitive abilities per se.},

 abstract = {"Gymnastic" (keeping infants standing up or jumping on one's lap) and breast-feeding have been the subjects of research with respect to the foraging lifestyle of the San (indigenous people of Southern Africa). To better understand these two phenomena, field research was conducted among the !Xu San, who had close associations with farming herding people. Analyses 1 showed that !Xu caretakers frequently engaged fretful infants in "gymnastic" exercise with emphasizing the function to soothe them, while it was reported previously that the San believe "gymnastic" behavior promote infant motor development. Analyses 2 showed that mothers nursed their babies briefly and frequently at short intervals. It also indicated the following relevant features : (1) there was little restriction of time and space in nursing infants ; (2) during sucking, mothers gazed at infants less than usual ; (3) mothers seldom jiggled infants during pauses in sucking ; and (4) "gymnastic" behavior sometimes interrupted breast-feeding. These findings suggest that there is a cultural diversity in caretaker reactions caused by infant behaviors, and that caretaker-infant interactions gradually become organized. This study also implicates that child rearing should be interpreted in relation to cultural structures, including behavior, folk knowledge and the environment.},

As an overview, the classification of the African languages, the language situation and some linguistic topics are briefly described in this article. In the following articles, some topics on phonetic and phonological phenomena of each language family will be presented and discussed by scholars specializing in the languages. The scholars are all field-workers and use mainly their own data collected in the fields. The following are their main subjects: (1) the sound system in the Afro-Asian family, referring to uvularization, (2) phonetic and phonological topics in the Nilo-Saharan family, (3) the click sounds in the Khoisan family, and (4) the tonological characteristics and velarized consonants of Bantu languages in the Niger-Congo family. Though, there are many other interesting phenomena in African languages that are not dealt with in these feature articles, the authors hope the reader will become interested in African languages.},

 abstract = {The presence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are causing substantial global public concern; however, the dispersal of ARGs in the food chain is poorly understood. Here, we experimented with a soil collembolan ( Folsomia candida)-predatory mite ( Hypoaspis aculeifer) model food chain to study trophic transfer of ARGs in a manure-contaminated soil ecosystem. Our results showed that manure amendment of soil could significantly increase ARGs in the soil collembolan microbiome. With the ARGs in the prey collembolan microbiome increasing, an increase in ARGs in the predatory mite microbiome was also observed, especially for three high abundant ARGs ( blaSHV, fosX and aph6ia). Three unique ARGs were transferred into the microbiome of the predatory mite from manure amended soil via the prey collembolan ( aac(6' )-lb(akaaacA4), yidY_mdtL and tolC). Manure amendment altered the composition and structure and reduced the diversity of the microbiomes of the prey collembolan and the predatory mite. We further reveal that bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements were two important drivers for the trophic transfer of ARGs, not just for ARGs distribution in the samples. These findings suggest that the importance of food chain transmission of ARGs for the dispersal of resistance genes in soil ecosystems may be underestimated.},

While the impact of dietary carbohydrates to the dental microbiome has been well-documented, the effect of fiber as a mechanical influence on the dental microbiome is unexplored. We performed 16S rRNA gene analysis to investigate the response of the dental microbiome to the presence of increased fiber in terms of microbial taxonomic abundance and diversity. Dental microbial community structure was significantly different in mice fed a diet supplemented with increased fiber and/or sugar. Fiber significantly affected measures of beta diversity at the phylum and genus levels, and a strong interactive effect on alpha diversity was observed between sugar and fiber at the phylum level. The addition of fiber also induced significant variation in relative taxonomic abundance. This study demonstrates that fiber can promote significant variations in the mouse dental microbiome.},

 abstract = {Microorganisms resident in our bodies participate in a variety of regulatory and pathogenic processes. Here, we describe how etiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be regulated or disturbed by symbiotic microbial activity. Furthermore, the composition of symbiotic microbes has changed dramatically across human history alongside the rise of agriculturalism, industrialization, and globalization. We postulate that each of these lifestyle transitions engendered progressive depletion of microbial diversity and enhancement of virulence, thereby enhancing AD risk pathways. It is likely that the human life span extended into the eighth decade tens of thousands of years ago, yet little is known about premodern geriatric epidemiology. We propose that microbiota of the gut, oral cavity, nasal cavity, and brain may modulate AD pathogenesis, and that changes in the microbial composition of these body regions across history suggest escalation of AD risk. Dysbiosis may promote immunoregulatory dysfunction due to inadequate education of the immune system, chronic inflammation, and epithelial barrier permeability. Subsequently, proinflammatory agents-and occasionally microbes-may infiltrate the brain and promote AD pathogenic processes. APOE genotypes appear to moderate the effect of dysbiosis on AD risk. Elucidating the effect of symbiotic microbiota on AD pathogenesis could contribute to basic and translational research.},

 abstract = {Kit-based assays, such as Absolute<i>IDQ</i><sup>TM</sup> p150, are widely used in large cohort studies and provide a standardized method to quantify blood concentrations of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). Many disease-relevant associations of PCs were reported using this method. However, their interpretation is hampered by lack of functionally-relevant information on the detailed fatty acid side-chain compositions as only the total number of carbon atoms and double bonds is identified by the kit. To enable more substantiated interpretations, we characterized these PC sums using the side-chain resolving Lipidyzer<sup>TM</sup> platform, analyzing 223 samples in parallel to the Absolute<i>IDQ</i><sup>TM</sup>. Combining these datasets, we estimated the quantitative composition of PC sums and subsequently tested their replication in an independent cohort. We identified major constituents of 28 PC sums, revealing also various unexpected compositions. As an example, PC 16:0_22:5 accounted for more than 50% of the PC sum with in total 38 carbon atoms and 5 double bonds (PC aa 38:5). For 13 PC sums, we found relatively high abundances of odd-chain fatty acids. In conclusion, our study provides insights in PC compositions in human plasma, facilitating interpretation of existing epidemiological data sets and potentially enabling imputation of PC compositions for future meta-analyses of lipidomics data.},

Here, by considering a well mixed population of individuals who produce signals and decide on their strategies in a game they play, based on the signals, we show that costly signals and costly cooperative strategies can co-evolve as a result of internal dynamics of the system. Costly signals evolve, despite their apparent cost, due to a favorable cooperative response they elicit. This favorable strategic response can be quantified in a fitness term which governs the distribution of costly signals better than their apparent cost. In the same way, cooperative strategies evolve as they can reach a high fitness due to the internal dynamics of the systems.},

 abstract = {The Early Upper Paleolithic period in the Levant is essential in the studies of the establishment of modern human communities outside Africa, and corresponding archaeological evidence may be used to shed light on human ecology, economy and demography. Specifically, cultural differences between two Early Upper Paleolithic entities, the Early Ahmarian and the Levantine Aurignacian, raise the question of differing adaptations. In this article we use archaeofaunal remains from the Early Upper Paleolithic sequence at Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel), to track human hunting patterns, carcass transport and processing within the Early Ahmarian (46-42 ka) and Levantine Aurignacian (38-34 ka) phases. We test two hypotheses: 1) the Ahmarian and Aurignacian represent adaptations to different environments; and 2) the two entities differ in mobility patterns and site use. Our multivariate taphonomic analysis showed subtle differences in depositional processes between the two phases and demonstrated a primarily anthropogenic complex. In both phases, human subsistence was based on two ungulate species, mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) and Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica), with some contribution from birds, tortoises and small mammals. Among the gazelles, it appears that female herds were targeted, and that hunting took place close to the cave. The results of the research show great similarity in environmental exploitation between the Ahmarian and Aurignacian phases concerning prey spectrum and choice, carcass transport and processing. These patterns occupy a middle position between the Middle Paleolithic and the late Epipaleolithic of the region. Despite this, there are also several significant differences between the phases such as increased exploitation of small game (especially birds) and faster accumulation and higher densities of material in the Aurignacian. This may indicate greater occupation intensity during the Aurignacian compared to the Ahmarian, and thus could explain the outstanding character of this entity in the Levant.},

 abstract = {Gut microbiota regulates host metabolism and immunity. The phylogenetic composition of gut microbiota is influenced by diverse factors that include host gender. In this study, the effects of gender on gut microbial composition and its subsequent influence on serum metabolites in pigs were evaluated. The bacterial composition of feces samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 293 pure-bred Duroc pigs (108 gilts and 185 entire boars) and 64 validated pigs from an eight-breed mosaic F<sub>6</sub> population. Twenty-eight F<sub>6</sub> boars were castrated at 80 days of age to evaluate the effects of androgen on gut microbial composition. Untargeted serum metabolite features were determined in 45 boars and 26 gilts by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS). The study observed an obvious influence of host gender on the gut microbial composition and identified numerous sex-biased bacterial taxa. These included Veillonellaceae, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Bulleidia</i>, and <i>Escherichia</i> which showed the higher abundance in boars, and <i>Treponema</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> which were over-represented in gilts. Castration significantly shifted the fecal microbiota composition of the boars toward that of gilts. The predicted functional pathways of the gut microbiome related to obesity and energy harvest were enriched in gilts, and positively associated with gilt-enriched bacteria. Functional pathways related to peptidases and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in boars and positively associated with boar-enriched bacteria. Serum metabolites related to androgen and cresol metabolism were identified as sex-biased metabolites. Correlation analysis between serum metabolites and sex-biased bacteria identified that the serum concentration of androgen-related metabolites was positively correlated with <i>Bulleidia</i> and <i>Escherichia</i>, but negatively associated with <i>Treponema</i>, suggesting a significant interaction between gut microbiota and host sex hormone metabolism. These results offer basic knowledge of how host gender and gut microbiota influence host metabolism.},

 abstract = {The reconstruction of everyday diets in villages is important for understanding the diversity of diets and commerce networks of food items in premodern Japan. However, premodern diets in villages have not been well studied compared with those in cities. In this study, stable isotope analyses were performed on 23 adult human skeletons excavated from Sendaiji, a mountainous woodland village of underground Christians in Osaka in premodern Japan. No significant isotopic differences was found between individuals identified as Buddhists and those identified as Christians or between females and males. The total mean carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope ratios were −21.1 ± 0.4‰, 11.6 ± 1.0‰, and 8.9 ± 1.3‰, respectively. The carbon isotope ratios in Sendaiji were the lowest among the studied premodern populations probably because these individuals consumed woodland foods that are affected by the canopy effect. No significant correlation between sulfur and nitrogen isotope ratios was apparent, suggesting that there was little contribution from marine foods or marine fertilizers to the diet of individuals in premodern Sendaiji. The relatively high nitrogen isotope ratios in Sendaiji were possibly because of the denitrification in paddy rice fields, ammonium uptake by paddy rice, use of animal fertilizers, and/or consumption of freshwater fish. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed bioarchaeological study of the premodern diet in a mountainous village in western Japan.},

 abstract = {A paleosurface with a concentration of wooden-, bone-, and stone-tools interspersed among an accumulation of fossil bones, largely belonging to the straight-tusked elephant Palaeoloxodon antiquus, was found at the bottom of a pool, fed by hot springs, that was excavated at Poggetti Vecchi, near Grosseto (Tuscany, Italy). The site is radiometrically dated to the late Middle Pleistocene, around 171,000 years BP. Notable is the association of the artifacts with the elephant bones, and in particular the presence of digging sticks made from boxwood (Buxus sp.). Although stone tools show evidence of use mainly on animal tissues, indicating some form of interaction between hominins and animals, the precise use of the sticks is unclear. Here we discuss about the role played by the hominins at the site: paleobiological and taphonomic evidence indicates that the elephants died by a natural cause and were butchered soon after their death. The associated paleontological and archeological evidence from this site provides fresh insights into the behavior of early Neanderthals in Central Italy. The discovery of Poggetti Vecchi shows how opportunistically flexible Neanderthals were in response to environmental contingencies.},

 abstract = {Diet is considered a key influencing agent affecting the gut microbiome. Dysbiosis of microbial communities contributes to the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity. We aimed to characterize the physiological, microbial and metabolic changes induced by different obesogenic diets to understand the diet-specific modulation of the host-microbiota co-metabolism in rodents. For this purpose, Wistar rats were fed standard, cafeteria (CAF), low-fat (LF), high-fat (HF) and high-fat high-sucrose (HFS) diets for 10 weeks. The CAF diet strongly induced an obese phenotype accompanied by dyslipidemia, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, whereas both HF and HFS diets promoted overweight. Concerning the microbiome, CAF feeding induced a rise of the Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio, while few microbial genera were altered in the HF or HFS group. Changes in microbial activity according to dietary treatment were also reflected in the disruption of short-chain fatty acid production and bile acid metabolism, which were mainly associated with fiber intake. Urinary metabolomics revealed a significant increase in metabolites related to oxidative stress and metabolic inflammation together with an altered excretion of host-microbiota co-metabolites only in the CAF group. Moreover, several associations between metabolic patterns, physiological status and specific microbial communities were described, helping to elucidate the crucial role of the microbiota in host homeostasis. Overall, our study suggests that different hypercaloric dietary models distinctively influence gut microbiota composition and reveals robust and similar clustering patterns concerning both cecal microbiome and urinary metabolome profiles.},

 abstract = {Mortality profiles can be used to investigate modes of accumulation of fossil assemblages, including predation by ancient nonhuman and human (Homo) hunters. Prey age at death reflects hunting decisions and opportunities in terms of calories returned for energy spent and risks taken. Nonhuman carnivores commonly harvest vulnerable individuals (young and old), whereas humans consistently can take prime adults. As an example of how mortality profiles can be used to illuminate predator behavior, this article examines when the ability to select prime-age animals emerged during human behavioral evolution. Although it would be expected that the appearance of this behavior coincided with the appearance of morphologically and archaeologically modern humans, analyses of archaeological assemblages from western Europe and South Africa suggest that this trait was already present in archaic people who preceded modern humans. Studying age distributions in fossil assemblages is not without its limitations, including the difficulty of estimating age at death in fossil specimens, pre- and postdepositional biases, and reconstructing the age structure and behavior of prey herds. Nevertheless, valuable behavioral information can be gained by using controlled comparisons of many assemblages.},

 abstract = { In recent years, the Arabian Peninsula has emerged as a key region for elucidating hominin and faunal evolution and dispersals between Africa and Eurasia. Central to this research is the middle Pleistocene site of Ti's al Ghadah (TAG) which has yielded a diverse and abundant fossil faunal assemblage and the earliest chronometrically dated evidence for hominins in this part of the world. Here, we present the first detailed taphonomic study of the large Unit 5 fossil assemblage from the site. We aim to assess which actor/s were responsible for the accumulation of the assemblage and evaluate evidence that might be consistent with the accumulation of fauna by hominins. We also describe, for the first time, fossils and lithic artefacts from stratigraphic horizons not previously considered, providing taphonomic insights into their accumulation. The taphonomic work shows that the Unit 5 faunal assemblage was accumulated by ambush predators, likely large felids and hominins, in a lake side environment, and that carcasses were subsequently scavenged by more durophagus carnivores such as hyenas and canids. Less can be reliably said regarding the newly described fossil assemblages given their poor preservation and significant wind abrasion, but large carnivores again appear to have played a role, and hominins probably played a role in the accumulation of at least one of these. This study provides the first detail insights into the interplay between hominins, carnivores, and herbivores in Arabia, and suggests that watering holes have been a focus on the Arabian landscape for resources since the middle Pleistocene.},

 abstract = {Individuals vary in their propensity to use social learning, the engine of cultural evolution, to acquire information about their environment. The causes of those differences, however, remain largely unclear. Using an agent-based model, we tested the hypothesis that as a result of reproductive skew differences in energetic requirements for reproduction affect the value of social information. We found that social learning is associated with lower variance in yield and is more likely to evolve in risk-averse low-skew populations than in high-skew populations. Reproductive skew may also result in sex differences in social information use, as empirical data suggest that females are often more risk-averse than males. To explore how risk may affect sex differences in learning strategies, we simulated learning in sexually reproducing populations where one sex experiences more reproductive skew than the other. When both sexes compete for the same resources, they tend to adopt extreme strategies: the sex with greater reproductive skew approaches pure individual learning and the other approaches pure social learning. These results provide insight into the conditions that promote individual and species level variation in social learning and so may affect cultural evolution.},

 abstract = {It has often been assumed that a link exists between climate change and human dispersion during the initial peopling of the Atacama Desert. However, there is little understanding of how hunter-gatherers acquired and processed environmental information. We examine paleoenvironmental and archaeological data to propose that the early peopling of the highlands of the south-central Atacama was a gradual process modulated by landscape learning. Evidence suggests that initial occupations at the end of the Pleistocene were limited to intermediate altitude levels, where the ecological structure was more easily legible and productive. This allowed human groups to make use of general, transferrable landscape knowledge, based mainly on the hunting of wild camelids and the gathering of plant resources in azonal formations. However, the arid event of the Early Holocene led to successive episodes of abandonment and relocation to new areas, consolidating complementary land-use between the desert lowlands and the high puna. Two complementary strategies for the acquisition and transmission of information can be identified: (1) scouting as part of logistical hunting parties; and (2) information-pooling rooted in broad, flexible social networks. We conclude that in the face of uncertain conditions, hunter-gatherers invested more effort in learning the landscape and sharing environmental knowledge.},

 abstract = {The composition and organisational patterns of Pleistocene human groups are a main research when it comes to the evolution of human behaviour. However, these studies are often limited by the restricted characteristics of the archaeological records and do not show enough resolution to make approaches with the necessary precision. The travertinic formations of the Abric Romaní site (Capellades, Barcelona, Spain) provide an ideal scenario to answer some questions about the European Middle Palaeolithic occupational patterns. The hearth-related accumulations from this site show many similarities with those generated by several contemporary forager groups, so each could represent the activity area of a specific social unit. This work contributes to the existing research by examining the faunal refits recovered in six stratigraphic units (H, I, J-Ja, K, L and M) that cover the chronological period between 44 and 55 ka. Faunal refits are analysed using the metric parameters of ethnographic hearth-related accumulations (the hearth itself and its corresponding drop and toss zones); significant relationships are found between many of these elements and the areas of influence of the hearths. In addition, connections between the activity areas from these refits are seen in several stratigraphic units. This phenomenon allows for greater diversity in the occupational patterns of this site to be identified than those recorded only from taphonomic studies. From this perspective, two main occupational models are proposed: (1) the simple model, in which isolated and unconnected hearth-related accumulations are identified (units H, L and—to a lesser extent—K) and (2) the complex model, primarily represented by the identification of several long-distance faunal refits connecting different activity areas (units I, J-Ja and M). Thus, this work provides deeper insights into the behavioural diversity of Middle Palaeolithic human groups, their social organisation and composition and their evolution in the region.},

Field biologists generate invaluable data on survival and reproductive rates, as a function of age and stage, that are used to parameterise structured models. These models often perform well at predicting population growth and mean LRS, but we do not know whether they accurately predict observed distributions of individual LRS. If the models fail to recreate these distributions, their use may be limited because the LRS is central to understanding life history evolution. We present powerful tools to generate distributions of LRS from age and/or stage structured models. Our methods reveal that structured models do perform well at generating distributions that agree with observations. Our approach also reveals why such skewed distributions arise, and helps resolve a debate about detecting signatures of selection in skewed distributions of LRS.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Adult honey bees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over two years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data shows that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift towards high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter , and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease. },

 abstract = {The Ultimatum Game is a famous sequential, two-player game intensely studied
in Game Theory. A proposer can offer a certain fraction of some amount of a
valuable good, for example, money. A responder can either accept, in which case
the money is shared accordingly, or reject the offer, in which case the two
players receive nothing. While most authors suggest that the fairest split of
50 % vs. 50 % would be the equilibrium solution, recently R. Suleiman (An
aspirations-homeostasis theory of interactive decisions (2014)) suggested the
Golden Ratio, 0.618, to be the solution and argued that such a partitioning
would be considered fair by both sides. He provided a justification in terms of
an approach termed aspirations-homeostasis theory. The main idea is that
responders tend to accept the minor fraction of the Golden Ratio because they
feel that this fraction equals, in comparison to the larger fraction obtained
by the proposer, the ratio of the larger fraction and the whole amount. Here we
give an alternative explanation to that suggested solution, which complements
the reasoning by Suleiman (2014) and is based on infinite continued fractions.},

 abstract = {The analysis of eight molecular datasets involving human and teleost examples
along with morphological samples from several groups of Neotropical electric
fish (Order: Gymnotiformes) were used in this thesis to test the dynamics of
both intraspecific variation and interspecific diversity. In terms of
investigating molecular interspecific diversity among humans, two experimental
exercises were performed. A cladistic exchange experiment tested for the extent
of discontinuity and interbreeding between H. sapiens and neanderthal
populations. As part of the same question, another experimental exercise tested
the amount of molecular variance resulting from simulations which treated
neanderthals as being either a local population of modern humans or as a
distinct subspecies. Finally, comparisons of hominid populations over time with
fish species helped to define what constitutes taxonomically relevant
differences between morphological populations as expressed among both trait
size ranges and through growth patterns that begin during ontogeny. Compared to
the subdivision found within selected teleost species, H. sapiens molecular
data exhibited little variation and discontinuity between geographical regions.
Results of the two experimental exercises concluded that neanderthals exhibit
taxonomic distance from modern H. sapiens. However, this distance was not so
great as to exclude the possibility of interbreeding between the two
subspecific groups. Finally, a series of characters were analyzed among species
of Neotropical electric fish. These analyses were compared with hominid
examples to determine what constituted taxonomically relevant differences
between populations as expressed among specific morphometric traits that
develop during the juvenile phase.},

 abstract = {Foraging is constrained by the energy within resources and the mechanics of
acquisition and assimilation. Thick molar enamel, a character trait
differentiating hominins from African apes, is predicted to mitigate the
mechanical costs of chewing obdurate foods. The classic expression of
hyperthick enamel together with relatively massive molars, termed megadontia,
is most evident in {\it Paranthropus}, a lineage of hominins that lived ca. 2.7
to 1.2 million years ago. Among contemporary primates, thicker molar enamel
corresponds with the consumption of stiffer, deformation-resistant foods,
possibly because thicker enamel can better resist cracking under high
compressive loads. Accordingly, plant underground storage organs (USOs) are
thought to be a central food resource for hominins such as {\it Paranthropus}
due to their abundance, isotopic composition, and mechanical properties. Here,
we present a process-based model to investigate foraging constraints as a
function of energetic demands and enamel wear among human ancestors. Our
framework allows us to determine the fitness benefits of megadontia, and to
explore under what conditions stiff foods such as USOs are predicted to be
chosen as fallback, rather than preferred, resources. Our model predictions
bring consilience to the noted disparity between functional interpretations of
megadontia and microwear evidence, particularly with respect to {\it
Paranthropus boisei}.},

 abstract = {Gut residential hundred trillion microbial cells are indispensable for maintaining gut homeostasis and impact on host physiology, development and immune systems. Many of them have displayed excellence in utilising dietary- and host-derived complex glycans and are producing useful postbiotics including short-chain fatty acids to primarily fuel different organs of the host. Therefore, employing individual microbiota is nowadays becoming a propitious target in biomedical for improving gut dysbiosis conditions of the host. Among other gut microbial communities, Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria are coevolved to utilise diverse ranges of diet- and host-derived glycans through harmonising distinct glycan utilisation systems. These gut symbionts frequently share digested oligosaccharides, carbohydrate-active enzymes and fermentable intermediate molecules for sustaining gut microbial symbiosis and improving fitness of own or other communities. Genomics approaches have provided unprecedented insights into these functions, but their precise mechanisms of action have poorly known. Sympathetic glycan-utilising strategy of each gut commensal will provide overview of mechanistic dynamic nature of the gut environment and will then assist in applying aptly personalised nutritional therapy. Thus, the review critically summarises cutting edge understanding of major plant- and host-derived glycan-utilising systems of Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria. Their evolutionary adaptation to gut environment and roles of postbiotics in human health are also highlighted.},

 abstract = {Longevity has been described as the result of a complex combination of variables, hailing from genetics, lifestyle and environment. In this context, the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a possible mediator of healthy aging that preserves host-environment homeostasis by counteracting inflammaging, intestinal permeability, and deterioration of cognitive and bone health. Correlations have been previously found between age-related gut microbiota dysbioses and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hospitalization, poor diet and frailty in the elderly. More recently, the longest human gut microbiota trajectory along aging has been built, by comparing the fecal bacterial taxa from healthy adults and older individuals, also including semi-supercentenarians, i.e. people aged 105 or older. However, the functional changes that occur in the gut microbiome along with age are still largely unexplored. In an attempt to provide some glimpses in this direction and advance our knowledge on whether and how the gut microbiome may support the maintenance of health in extreme aging, here we characterized the fecal microbiome of 62 individuals, with age ranging from 22 to 105 years, by shotgun metagenomics. According to our findings, aging is characterized by an increased number of genes involved in xenobiotics degradation, as well as by rearrangements in metabolic pathways related to carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism. These microbiome features are even more boosted in semi-supercentenarians, probably representing the result of a life-long adaptive response to progressive changes in diet and lifestyle.},

The current study is centered in the Western sector, where the majority of the materials come from layer PB-7 (%NISP = 92.5). Overall, this layer does not show signs of weathering, exhibiting instead trampling marks, and in a lesser quantity, large carnivore tooth marks. The fragmentation level is low, particularly for the fossils of Gomphotheriidae, for which most of the fractures occurred when the fossils were not fresh. No human marks of any kind were identified. The impact of these distinct factors in the formation of the record of PB-7 was evaluated using the available data and concluded in an in situ death of a gomphothere, to which would have been added anatomical elements of other taxa, redeposited coluvially and/or through vertical migration as a result of trampling. Carnivores would have been primarily responsible for the alteration and possibly subtraction of skeletal remains; as of now there is no evidence of human impact in this process. The materials recovered in PB-8 layer could also have been deposited by colluvial processes, although the sample is very small to discuss the taphonomic processes that have occurred in this layer.},

 abstract = {Abstract
                The gut microbiome is structured by social groups in a variety of host taxa. Whether this pattern is driven by relatedness, similar diets, or shared social environments is under debate because few studies have had access to the data necessary to disentangle these factors in wild populations. We investigated whether diet, relatedness, or the 1-meter proximity network best explains differences in the gut microbiome among 45 female colobus monkeys in 8 social groups residing at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We combined demographic and behavioural data collected May-August 2007 and October 2008-April 2009 with 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples collected during the latter part of each observation period. Social group identity explained a large percentage of the variation in gut microbiome beta-diversity. When comparing the predictive power of dietary dissimilarity, relatedness, and connectedness in the 1-meter proximity network, the models with social connectedness received the strongest support, even in our analyses that excluded within-group dyads. This novel finding indicates that microbes may be transmitted during intergroup encounters, which could occur either indirectly via shared environments or directly via social contact. Lastly, some of the gut microbial taxa that appear to be transmitted via 1-meter proximity are associated with digestion of plant material, but further research is needed to investigate whether this type of gut microbe transmission yields health benefits, which could provide an incentive for the formation and maintenance of social bonds within and between social groups.},

 abstract = {Communication involves the actual use of language in real. As we have known that language is the main medium for communication. One of the important thing to develop the effective communication is by packaging the structure of information. There are two basic elements in the information, they are: theme and rheme. Theme had been considered as the known information and the rheme absolutely had been considered as new information. This paradigm based on the Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Halliday considers language as having three main functions: (1) the ideational function; (2) the interpersonal function; and (3) the textual function. This paper will focus in the textual function and “clause as a message”. Arabic language has a unique structure of clauses, we can find two basic notions (mubtada’+khabar) and (fi’l+fa’il), in the other hand, semantically, we can find (musnad+musnad ilaih), so this article tried to find the correlation between the structure of Arabic clauses with (theme+rheme) construction. This article also will find out the kinds of theme in Arabic language (multiple themes, clause as themes, and predicated themes). Theme as an initial element in SFL should be described by looking the rheme in the text. The method in this research was divided into three parts: (1) collecting the data from the book of Modern Written Arabic and also some articles in the Arabic-Javanese translation book Bidayah al-Hidayah, the data is the clauses with nominal and verbal initial; (2) analysis data, using the descriptive analysis and distributional method; and (3) reporting the data (formal and informal). The result of this article had concluded that there is a near connection between (mubtada’+khabar), (fi’l+fa’il), and (musnad+musnad ilaih) with the theme and rheme construction based on the SFL theory.},

 abstract = {Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is produced non-enzymatically when the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol is exposed to UV-B, i.e., evolutionary the first function of the molecule was that of an UV-B radiation scavenging end product. Vitamin D endocrinology started when some 550 million years ago first species developed a vitamin D receptor (VDR) that binds with high affinity the vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. VDR evolved from a subfamily of nuclear receptors sensing the levels of cholesterol derivatives, such as bile acids, and controlling metabolic genes supporting cellular processes, such as innate and adaptive immunity. During vertebrate evolution, the skeletal and adaptive immune system showed in part interesting synchronous development although adaptive immunity is evolutionary older. There are bidirectional osteoimmune interactions between the immune system and bone metabolism, the regulation of both is under control of vitamin D. This diversity of physiological functions explains the pleiotropy of vitamin D signaling and opens the potential for various pharmacological applications of vitamin D as well as of its natural and synthetic derivatives. The overall impact of vitamin D on human health is demonstrated by the fact that the need for its efficient synthesis served in European hunter and gatherers as an evolutionary driver for increased 7-dehydrocholesterol levels, while light skin was established far later via populations from Anatolia and the northern Caucasus entering Europe 9000 and 5000 years ago, respectively. The later population settled preferentially in northern Europe and we hypothesize that that the introduction of high vitamin D responsiveness was an essential trait for surviving dark winters without suffering from the detrimental consequences of vitamin D deficiency.},

 abstract = {The use of space, both at the landscape and the site level, is considered an important aspect of hominin adaptations that changed through time. At the site level, spatial analyses are typically conducted on deposits thought to have a high degree of temporal resolution. Sites with highly time-averaged deposits are viewed as inferior for these analyses because repeated site visits obscure individual behavioral events. To the contrary, here, we take the view that behaviors that repeat themselves in a spatially structured way through time are exactly the kinds of behaviors that are potentially significant at an evolutionary timescale. In this framework, time averaging is seen not as a hindrance but rather as a necessary condition for viewing meaningful behavior. To test whether such patterning is visible in time-averaged deposits, we use spatial statistics to analyze a number of indices designed to measure lithic production, use and discard behaviors in a multi-layer, late Neandertal cave site in southwest France. We find that indeed some such patterning does exist, and thus sites with highly time-averaged deposits have the potential to contribute to our understanding of how hominin use of space varied through time. This is useful because a great many archaeological sites have highly time-average deposits. Interpreting the spatial patterning will likely require modeling to create expectations in time-averaged and likely emergent contexts such as these.},

We investigated the effect of age, sex and kinship on the teaching of subsistence skills. We found that child-to-child teaching was more frequent than adult-child teaching. Additionally, children taught more with age, teaching was more likely to occur within same-sex versus opposite-sex dyads, and close kin were more likely to teach than non-kin. The Hadza and BaYaka also showed distinct learning patterns; teaching was more likely to occur between sibling dyads among the Hadza than among the BaYaka, and a multistage learning model where younger children learn from peers, and older children from adults, was evident for the BaYaka, but not for the Hadza. We attribute these differences to subsistence and settlement patterns. These findings highlight the role of children in the intergenerational transmission of subsistence skills.},

Considering the three aspects of gait, center of gravity and motion, 25 eigenvalues were extracted to evaluate the body balance of the elderly. Then, we constructed a balanced risk assessment system for the elderly. The entropy method is used to calculate the information content of eigenvalues as the basis of weighting. We added the elderly BMI and disease history to the risk assessment system for simulation calculation. Borrowing economic thoughts, constructing a random frontier model based on whether the elderly fall as a dependent variable, comparatively analyzing by gender, and studying the influence of gait and exercise on the balance ability of the elderly. We found that gait and center of gravity have a greater impact on the balance of the elderly, BMI has less influence, and the balance between male and female is quite different. Finally, the model is tested. We analyze the sensitivity of each index of the risk assessment system. The results are in line with expectations and the model has certain applicability.},

Common explanations include kin selection and limited accuracy in parentage assessment. However, these explanations do not cover the breadth of circumstances in which paternal care has been observed, particularly in cases of uncertain paternity. Here we propose that microbes may play a key role in the evolution of paternal care among their hosts. Using computational models, we demonstrate that microbes associated with increased paternal care could be favoured by natural selection. We find that microbe-induced paternal care could evolve under wider conditions than suggested by genetic models. Moreover, we show that microbe-induced paternal care is more likely to evolve when considering paternal care interactions that increase microbial transmission, such as feeding and grooming. Our results imply that factors affecting the composition of host microbiome may also alter paternal behaviour.},

Thus, gut microbiota might be a contributor to the human longevity and a promising target for diagnostics of the health status. Since gut microbiota composition and function can be modulated, it has great promise in promoting healthy ageing. Gut microbiota has already been proved to affect the host longevity in animal models; however, relevant results need to be confirmed in further human studies. Thus, in order to determine the possible causative relationship between gut microbiota and longevity in humans, it is critical to obtain insights into the gut microbiota pattern in centenarians. In this chapter, we focus on the diverse patterns of gut microbiota in centenarians across populations and describe the possible network of longevity associated with gut microbiota regarding host immunity and metabolism.},

 abstract = {Several outcomes have been reported on the role of gut microbiota in health promotion and disease prevention. Kyotango, one of the longevity areas with various centenarians, is a provincial city located in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture in Japan. To understand the relationship between gut microbiota and urbanization, we compared the diversity, abundance, and function of gut microbiota in older healthy subjects between Kyotango and Kyoto cities; Kyoto is an urban city located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture. In total, 51 subjects at Kyotango and 51 subjects at Kyoto matched by age and gender were recruited, and their fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis for β-diversity revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota between two cities. In contrast, the analysis of α-diversity revealed no significant differences between the groups. On comparison at the phylum levels, the abundance of Firmicutes was decreased with the urbanization, whereas that of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased. On comparison at the genus levels, with urbanization, a significant decrease was observed in Lachnospiraceae families including genus <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Coprococcus</i>, and significant increases was observed in <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Oscillospira</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>. The most markedly increased functional pathway with urbanization was lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and decreased pathway was transporters and ABC transporters. In conclusion, the present findings indicate significant differences in the gut microbiota between the provincial city and urban cities at Kyoto Prefecture. These alterations in the microbiota may provide new insights to consider the relationship between longevity and gut microbiota.},

 abstract = {Characterization of microbial communities using high-throughput amplicon sequencing is an emerging approach for microbial source tracking of fecal pollution. This study used SourceTracker software to examine temporal and geographical variability of fecal bacterial community profiles to identify pollutant sources in three freshwater catchments in sub-tropical Australia. Fecal bacterial communities from 10 animal species, humans, and composite wastewater samples from six sewage treatment plants were characterized and compared to freshwater samples using Illumina amplicon sequencing of the V5-V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Source contributions were calculated in SourceTracker using new fecal taxon libraries as well as previously generated libraries to determine the effects of geographic and temporal variability on source assignments. SourceTracker determined 16S rRNA bacterial communites within freshwater samples, shared taxonomic similarities to that of wastewater at low levels (typically <3%). SourceTraker also predicted occasional fecal detection of deer and flying fox sources in the water samples. No significant differences in source contributions were observed within sequences from current and previously characterized fecal samples (P ≥ 0.107). However, significant differences were observed between previously characterized and newly characterized source communities (ANOSIM P ≤ 0.001), which shared <15% community composition. Results suggest temporal instability of fecal taxon libraries among tested sources and highlight continual evaluation of community-based MST using confirmatory qPCR analyses of marker genes.},

 abstract = {The Palaeo-Agulhas Plain formed an important habitat exploited by Pleistocene hunter-gatherer populations during periods of lower sea level. This productive, grassy habitat would have supported numerous large-bodied ungulates accessible to a population of skilled hunters with the right hunting technology. It also provided a potentially rich location for plant food collection, and along its shores a coastline that moved with the rise and fall of sea levels. The rich archaeological and paleontological records of Pleistocene sites along the modern Cape south coast of South Africa, which would have overlooked the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain during Pleistocene times of lower sea level, provides a paleoarchive of this extinct ecosystem. In this paper, we present a first order illustration of the “palaeoscape modeling” approach advocated by Marean et al. (2015). We use a resourcescape model created from modern studies of habitat productivity without the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain. This is equivalent to predominant Holocene conditions before recent landscape modifications for farming. We then run an agent-based model of the human foraging system to investigate several research questions. Our agent-based approach uses the theoretical framework of optimal foraging theory to model human foraging decisions designed to optimize the net caloric gains within a complex landscape of spatially and temporally variable resources. We find that during the high sea-levels of MIS 5e (+5–6 m asl) and the Holocene, the absence of the Plain left a relatively poor food base supporting a much smaller population relying heavily on edible plant resources from the current Cape flora. Despite high species diversity of plants with edible storage organs, and marine invertebrates, encounter rates with highly profitable resources were low. We demonstrate that without the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain, human populations must have been small and low-density, and exploited plant, mammal, and marine resources with relatively low caloric returns. The exposure and contraction of the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain was likely the single biggest driver of behavioural change during periods of climate change through the Pleistocene and into the transition to the Holocene.},

 abstract = {BackgroundDiarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age. Enhanced understanding of causal pathways, pathogenesis, and sequelae of diarrhea is urgently needed. Although the gut microbiota is believed to play a role in susceptibility to diarrheal diseases, our understanding of this association remains incomplete. Infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are susceptible to diarrhea making them an ideal model to address this question.ResultsThe maturation of the infant rhesus macaque gut microbiome throughout the first 8 months of life occurs in a similar pattern as that described for human infants. Moreover, the microbiome of the captive reared infant rhesus macaque more closely resembles that of human infants in the developing world than in the western world. Importantly, prior to disease onset, the gut microbiome of infants that later develop diarrhea is enriched in pathways of immunomodulatory metabolite synthesis, while those of infants that remain asymptomatic are enriched in pathways for short-chain fatty acid production. We identify Prevotella strains that are more abundant at 1 month in infants that later develop diarrhea. At 8 months, the microbiomes of animals that experience diarrhea show increased abundance of Campylobacter and a reduction in Helicobacter macacae.ConclusionThe composition of the microbial community could provide a phenotypic marker of an infant’s susceptibility to diarrheal disease. Given the significant physiological and immunological similarities between human and nonhuman primates, these findings provide potential markers of susceptibility to diarrhea that could be modulated to improve infant health, especially in the developing world.},

Up to 33% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Africa have glomerulonephritis. Other major causes of CKD in Africa are Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium) infection and sickle cell disease. The major causes of CKD in children in Africa are glomerulonephritis and congenital abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract.

 abstract = {BackgroundThe microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn’s disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.ResultsWe show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids, lithocholic and deoxycholic acid. Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile acid producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic acid were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile acid producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn’s disease.ConclusionsThese data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile acid-producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn’s disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.},

In this paper, we present the first case report of an interactive relationship between carnivore species and hunter-gathers in Pleistocene China, based mainly on a detailed taphonomic study of the faunal remains from Shuidonggou Locality 7. It seems highly probable that hominins butchered some individuals of carnivores and roasted bone elements with adhering meat at the site; whereas it’s equally feasible that these animals were exploited by hominins mainly for their pelt or fur.

                  Owing to their close affinity, the African great apes are of interest in the study of human evolution. Although numerous researchers have described the ancestors we share with these species with reference to extant great apes, few have done so with phylogenetic comparative methods. One obstacle to the application of these techniques is the within-species phenotypic variation found in this group. Here, we leverage this variation, modelling common ancestors using ancestral state reconstructions (ASRs) with reference to subspecies-level trait data. A subspecies-level phylogeny of the African great apes and humans was estimated from full-genome mitochondrial DNA sequences and used to implement ASRs for 14 continuous traits known to vary between great ape subspecies. Although the inclusion of within-species phenotypic variation increased the phylogenetic signal for our traits and improved the performance of our ASRs, whether this was done through the inclusion of subspecies phylogeny or through the use of existing methods made little difference. Our ASRs corroborate previous findings that the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and bonobos was a chimp-like animal, but also suggest that the last common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas was an animal unlike any extant African great ape.},

Fossil tracksites provide a direct record of animals whose tracks have been preserved, and with regard to the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain they have direct relevance in considering palaeoecology. While biases may be present in ichnological data, they are different from the biases inherent in traditional body fossil studies. A ground survey along a 350 km portion of the Cape south coast, between Arniston in the west and Robberg in the east, identified well over a hundred-and-thirty ichnofossil sites in Late Pleistocene coastal aeolianites and lithified foreshore deposits. Some of these tracks were made by extinct species or subspecies. In other cases these tracksites demonstrate spatial range extensions of extant species, when compared with data available from body fossils or historical records. These sites include the largest and best preserved archive of Late Pleistocene hominin tracks thus far described. The tracksites occur on the margin of the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain, which may allow for palaeoenvironmental conclusions to be drawn regarding Late Pleistocene conditions on this extinct landscape. We summarize the most important sites, discuss the limitations and challenges of ichnological studies, and provide perspectives on future work.},

The three texture variables, calculated using scale-sensitive fractal analysis software (Sfrax® and Toothfrax®), included complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (epLsar), and textural fill volume (Tfv). Results indicate that anisotropy produced a significant difference between the groups with Mediterranean Neandertals showing significantly higher anisotropy values than their Northern European counterparts. The Mediterranean values are consistent with previously published DMTA anisotropy values for the Krapina Neandertals and suggest that Neandertals in this region were exploiting fibrous, homogenous foods, such as roots, tubers, grasses, and sedges that required consistent jaw movements. Elevated anisotropy signatures observed in Mediterranean Neandertals across both time and space suggest similar subsistence strategies that coincide with the relative climatic stability of the region and increased amounts of edible plant resources.},

 abstract = {Animals have stable dominant gut microbiomes under similar diets. Similar diets can also lead to similar gut microbial communities within host species levels. Giant pandas (<i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i>) and red pandas (<i>Ailurus fulgens</i>) have had long-term and stable bamboo diets, and seem well adapted to this highly fibrous diet. When compared to the gut microbiomes of Père David's deer (<i>Elaphurus davidianus</i>), humans, cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i>), black-backed jackal (<i>Canis-mesomelas</i>), and black bear (<i>Ursus thibetanus</i>), giant panda gut microbiomes have high variation in the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Clostridiaceae, and are somewhat unstable. This high instability and dissimilarity may reflect an unstable gut environment, perturbation or selective pressure because of their carnivorous gastrointestinal system. A short digestive tract, brief digestion time and fast intestinal peristalsis may result in higher oxygen concentrations that select for the growth of aerobes and facultative anaerobes in giant pandas. Potential selection of high proportion of Pseudomonadaceae in giant panda (GP-HP) and red panda gut microbiomes may arise because of their postulated ability to degrade secondary compounds (e.g., cyanide compounds and aromatic compounds). However, high proportion of Clostridiaceae (GP-HF) may focus on cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Thus, GP-HP and GP-HF groups have high dissimilarity on the functional level. These findings show that long-term similarities in diet do not always lead to similar or stable gut microbial system within the same host species and that other factors can drive the selection of gut taxa.},

 abstract = {This paper presents for the first time an experimental protocol for the assessment of use-wear produced when using Precambrian and metamorphic white Naibor Soit quartzite (NQ) flakes. NQ is the most recurrent raw material from the archaeological sites of the Olduvai Gorge during the Early Stone Age (ESA). The objective of this study is to provide a preliminary description of the experimentally produced use-wear traces that can be applied to the analysis of sites like the Acheulean site of Thiongo Korongo (TK, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) or other sites from Olduvai where NQ was used to tool production. This experimental protocol incorporates a broad range to tasks including plant processing (underground storage organs [USOs], wood, herbaceous plants, and canes) and carcass processing (butchery and bone processing). The most novel activity of this experimental protocol is the processing of USOs. For this we have replicated different steps of tuber processing including the cutting, peeling, and scraping of five varieties of USOs (Beta vulgaris, Daucus carota, Ipomoea batatas, Pastinaca sativa and Zingiber, officinale) with differences in hardness, fibrosity, water content, and peel regularity. After analysing micro and macro-wear traces on the experimental flakes, several criteria for distinguishing between different activities (scraping, cutting, peeling, sawing, cutting, butchery) and the different materials being processed were identified. These criteria are based on the presence, continuity, and morphology of macro-scars along with the presence, distribution, nature, and intensity of different micro traces (micro-scars, attrition, striations, pits, rounding, polish). Additionally, we have identified several processes that limit the formation of traces, including the tendency of some activities to weaken NQ edges and shorten the duration of use.},

 abstract = {Hunters often target species that require resource investment disproportionate to associated nutritional rewards. Costly signalling theory provides a potential explanation, proposing that hunters target species that impose high costs (e.g. higher failure and injury risks, lower consumptive returns) because it signals an ability to absorb costly behaviour. If costly signalling is relevant to contemporary 'big game' hunters, we would expect hunters to pay higher prices to hunt taxa with higher perceived costs. Accordingly, we hypothesized that hunt prices would be higher for taxa that are larger-bodied, rarer, carnivorous, or described as dangerous or difficult to hunt. In a dataset on 721 guided hunts for 15 North American large mammals, prices listed online increased with body size in carnivores (from approximately $550 to $1800 USD/day across the observed range). This pattern suggests that elements of costly signals may persist among contemporary non-subsistence hunters. Persistence might simply relate to deception, given that signal honesty and fitness benefits are unlikely in such different conditions compared with ancestral environments in which hunting behaviour evolved. If larger-bodied carnivores are generally more desirable to hunters, then conservation and management strategies should consider not only the ecology of the hunted but also the motivations of hunters.},

 abstract = {The presence of fast-moving small game in the Paleolithic archaeological faunal record has long been considered a key variable to assess fundamental aspects of human behavior and subsistence. Birds occupy a prominent place in this debate not only due to their small size and to the difficulties in capturing them (essentially due to their ability to fly and their elusiveness), but also due to their possible role in the symbolic array in regard to non-nutritional elements (feathers, talons, etc.) and as reflectors of complex human-world relationships. In this study, we attempt to contribute to this topic by presenting taphonomical data of bird specimens from Qesem Cave (Israel), dated between 420 and 200 ka. Human-induced damage, including cut marks, peeling and human gnawing, has been identified on wing bones of Cygnus sp., Columba sp., Corvus ruficollis and Sturnus sp. Our evidence suggests that avian exploitation was not limited to food only-either to complement the human diet or as occasional food item-but also presumably for the use of feathers. While the consumption of birds as a dietary source seems to be evident as early as the Early Pleistocene, the non-alimentary use of inedible elements, such as feathers and talons, appears to be a practice from the Middle Paleolithic onwards. We argue that the combined nutritional and symbolic use of birds is one characteristic of the new mode of adaptation practiced already by the late Lower Paleolithic Acheulo-Yabrudian hominins in the Levant starting 400 ka. The Qesem findings point to the possible emergence of new cognitive and behavioral skills, which are followed in later periods in the Old World. Finally, we discuss the possible ontological and cosmological significance of human-bird interactions to illuminate our hypothesis regarding the emergence of a new perception of human relationships with the world as an integral part of the new Acheulo-Yabrudian mode of adaptation.},

 abstract = {Abstract Dietary composition and antibiotic use are known to have major impacts on the structure and function of the gut microbiome, often resulting in dysbiosis. Despite this, little research has been done to explore the role of host diet as a determinant of antibiotic-induced microbiome disruption.  Here, we utilize a multi-omic approach to characterize the impact of Western-style diet consumption on ciprofloxacin-induced changes to gut microbiome community structure and transcriptional activity. We found that mice consuming a Western-style diet experienced a greater expansion of Firmicutes following ciprofloxacin treatment than those eating a control diet. At the transcriptional level, we found that ciprofloxacin induced a reduction in the abundance of TCA cycle transcripts on both diets, suggesting that carbon metabolism plays a key role in the response of the gut microbiome to this antibiotic. Despite this shared response, we observed extensive differences in the response of the microbiota to ciprofloxacin on each diet. In particular, at the whole-community level we detected an increase in starch degradation, glycolysis, and pyruvate fermentation following antibiotic treatment in mice on the Western diet, which we did not observe in mice on the control diet. Similarly, we observed diet-specific changes in the transcriptional activity of two important commensal bacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , involving diverse cellular processes such as nutrient acquisition, stress responses, and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. These findings demonstrate that host diet plays a key role in determining the extent of disruption of microbiome composition and function induced by antibiotic treatment.   Importance While both diet and antibiotics are individually known to have profound impacts on gut microbiome composition, little work has been done to examine the effect of these two factors combined. A number of negative health outcomes, including diabetes and obesity, are associated with diets high in simple sugars in fats but low in host-indigestible fiber, and some of these outcomes may be mediated by the gut microbiome. Likewise, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and the resulting dysbiosis is associated with many of the same detrimental side effects. Previous work has shown that nutrient availability, as influenced by host diet, plays an important role in determining the extent of antibiotic-induced disruption to the gut microbiome. Due to the growing incidence of disorders related to antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, it is essential to determine how the prevalence of high fat and sugar “Western”-style diets impacts the response of the microbiome to antibiotics. },

Here, in an effort to improve our understanding of the human microbiome, we compare gut microbiome composition and functional potential in 14 populations of humans from ten nations and 18 species of wild, non-human primates.ResultsContrary to expectations from host phylogenetics, we find that human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes. Additionally, our data reveal more inter-individual variation in gut microbiome functional potential within the human species than across other primate species, suggesting that the human gut microbiome may exhibit more plasticity in response to environmental variation compared to that of other primates.ConclusionsGiven similarities of ancestral human habitats and dietary strategies to those of baboons, these findings suggest that convergent ecologies shaped the gut microbiomes of both humans and cercopithecines, perhaps through environmental exposure to microbes, diet, and/or associated physiological adaptations. Increased inter-individual variation in the human microbiome may be associated with human dietary diversity or the ability of humans to inhabit novel environments. Overall, these findings show that diet, ecology, and physiological adaptations are more important than host-microbe co-diversification in shaping the human microbiome, providing a key foundation for comparative analyses of the role of the microbiome in human biology and health.},

 abstract = {Some aspects of human cognition and behavior appear unusual or exaggerated relative to those of other intelligent, warm-blooded, long-lived social species––including certain mammals (cetaceans, elephants, and great apes) and birds (corvids and passerines). One collection of such related features is our remarkable ability for ignoring or denying reality in the face of clear facts, a high capacity for self-deception and false beliefs, overarching optimism bias, and irrational risk-taking behavior (herein collectively called “reality denial”). Such traits should be maladaptive for reproductive success when they first appear as consistent features in individuals of any species. Meanwhile, available data suggest that self-awareness (knowledge of one’s own personhood) and basic theory of mind (ToM, also termed mind-reading, intentionality etc.) have evolved independently several times, particularly in the same kinds of species mentioned above. Despite a long-standing opportunity spanning tens of millions of years, only humans appear to have gone on to evolve an extended ToM (multilevel intentionality), a trait required for optimal expression of many other unusual cognitive attributes of our species, such as advanced linguistic communication and cumulative cooperative culture. The conventional view is that extended ToM emerged gradually in human ancestors, via stepwise positive selection of multiple traits that were each beneficial. A counterintuitive alternate possibility is that establishment of extended ToM has been repeatedly obstructed in all other species with the potential to achieve it, due to a “psychological evolutionary barrier,” that would arise in isolated individuals of a given species that develop the genetic ability for extended ToM. Such individuals would observe deaths of conspecifics whose minds they fully understood, become aware of mortality, and translate that knowledge into mortality salience (understanding of personal mortality). The resulting conscious realization and exaggeration of an already existing intrinsic fear of death risk would have then reduced the reproductive fitness of such isolated individuals (by favoring personal survival over reproduction). This “psychological evolutionary barrier” would have thus persisted until hominin ancestors broke through, via a rare and unlikely combination of cognitive changes, in which two intrinsically maladaptive traits (reality denial and extended ToM) evolved in the minds of the same individuals, allowing a “mind over reality transition” (MORT) over the proposed barrier. Once some individuals broke through in this manner, conventional natural selection could take over, with further evolution of beneficial aspects of the initial changes. This theory also provides a unifying evolutionary explanation for other unusual features of humans, including our recent emergence as the dominant species on the planet, and replacement of all other closely related evolutionary cousins, with limited interbreeding and no remaining hybrid species. While not directly falsifiable by experiment, the MORT theory fits with numerous facts about humans and human origins, and no known fact appears to strongly militate against it. It is also consistent with most other currently viable theories on related subjects, including terror management theory. Importantly, it has major implications for the human condition, as well as for many serious current issues, ranging all the way from lack of personal health responsibility to ignoring anthropogenic global climate disruption, which now threatens the very existence of our species.},

Although some of the oldest skeletal remains suggest an eastern African origin2, southern Africa is home to contemporary populations that represent the earliest branch of human genetic phylogeny5,6. Here we generate, to our knowledge, the largest resource for the poorly represented and deepest-rooting maternal L0 mitochondrial DNA branch (198 new mitogenomes for a total of 1,217 mitogenomes) from contemporary southern Africans and show the geographical isolation of L0d1’2, L0k and L0g KhoeSan descendants south of the Zambezi river in Africa. By establishing mitogenomic timelines, frequencies and dispersals, we show that the L0 lineage emerged within the residual Makgadikgadi–Okavango palaeo-wetland of southern Africa7, approximately 200 ka (95% confidence interval, 240–165 ka). Genetic divergence points to a sustained 70,000-year-long existence of the L0 lineage before an out-of-homeland northeast–southwest dispersal between 130 and 110 ka. Palaeo-climate proxy and model data suggest that increased humidity opened green corridors, first to the northeast then to the southwest. Subsequent drying of the homeland corresponds to a sustained effective population size (L0k), whereas wet–dry cycles and probable adaptation to marine foraging allowed the southwestern migrants to achieve population growth (L0d1’2), as supported by extensive south-coastal archaeological evidence8–10. Taken together, we propose a southern African origin of anatomically modern humans with sustained homeland occupation before the first migrations of people that appear to have been driven by regional climate changes.},

Like other complex organisms, abundant microbes live inside <i>C. sinica</i>; however, to date, microbiome composition and diversity of the whole life cycle in <i>C. sinica</i> has not yet been well characterized. In the current study, we analyze the composition and biodiversity of microbiota across the whole life cycle of <i>C. sinica</i> by using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Collectively, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes dominated the microenvironment at all stages, but their relative abundances fluctuated by host developmental stage. Interestingly, eggs, neonates, and adults shared similar microbes, including an abundance of <i>Rickettsia</i> and <i>Wolbachia</i>. After larva feeding, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, Enterobacteriaceae, and <i>Serratia</i> were enriched in larvae and pupa, suggesting that food may serve as a major factor contributing to altered microbial community divergence at different developmental stages. Our findings demonstrated that <i>C. sinica</i> harbor a variety of bacteria, and that dynamic changes in community composition and relative abundances of members of its microbiome occur during different life cycle stages. Evaluating the role of these bacterial symbionts in this natural enemy may assist in developing environmental risk assessments and novel biological control strategies.},

Here, we present the analysis of one eagle pedal phalange recovered from the Châtelperronian layer of Foradada Cave (Spain). Our research broadens the known geographical and temporal range of this symbolic behavior, providing the first documentation of its use among the Iberian populations, as well as of its oldest use in the peninsula. The recurrent appearance of large raptor talons throughout the Middle Paleolithic time frame, including their presence among the last Neanderthal populations, raises the question of the survival of some cultural elements of the Middle Paleolithic into the transitional Middle to Upper Paleolithic assemblages and beyond.},

 abstract = {Vast communities of microorganisms inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals. Understanding their initial development, fluctuations in composition, stability over long times, and responses to transient perturbations - in other words their dynamics - is important both for gaining basic insights into these ecosystems and for rationally manipulating them for therapeutic ends. Gut microbiome dynamics, however, remain poorly understood. We review here studies of gut microbiome dynamics in the presence and absence of external perturbations, noting especially the long timescales associated with overall stability and the short timescales associated with various underlying biological processes. Integrating these disparate timescales, we suggest, is an important goal for future work and is necessary for developing a predictive understanding of microbiome dynamics.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The microbiota-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.
METHODS: We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD.
RESULTS: The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD. Alterations of the gut microbiota may have the potential as biomarkers for distinguishing MDD patients form HCs.},

Evidence of Neanderthal occupations are observed throughout the sequence; with numerous lithic industries, burnt faunal remains, marine shells, and few human bones. In unit II, the richest one, lithic exploitation strategies are linked to the availability of major areas of flint supply implying a defined mobility pattern. Several archaeostratigraphic levels have been individualised, with ungulate remains affected by human and carnivore predation, involving alternated occupations of the cave during different periods. By confronting studies on origin and management of lithic raw material with taphonomical and zooarchaeological data of large mammals, we attempt to gain a better understanding of the site function, occupation duration, and regional mobility pattern in unit II of Ramandils Cave.},

In view of this; the chapter is designed to throw light on the significances of pursuing such an endeavour on the indigenous tribal populations; particularly of Manipur and their counterparts of other northeastern India in general; as one of the immediate agenda of prehistoric archaeologists well before the life ways of these people are totally corrupted owing to the extraneous influence; such as globalization and the like.},

 abstract = {Languages vary in their number of color terms. A widely accepted theory proposes that languages evolve, acquiring color terms in a stereotyped sequence. This theory, by Berlin and Kay (BK), is supported by analyzing best exemplars ("focal colors") of basic color terms in the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages. But the instructions of the WCS were complex and the color chips confounded hue and saturation, which likely impacted focal-color selection. In addition, it is now known that even so-called early-stage languages nonetheless have a complete representation of color distributed across the population. These facts undermine the BK theory. Here we revisit the evolution of color terms using original color-naming data obtained with simple instructions in Tsimane', an Amazonian culture that has limited contact with industrialized society. We also collected data in Bolivian-Spanish speakers and English speakers. We discovered that information theory analysis of color-naming data was not influenced by color-chip saturation, which motivated a new analysis of the WCS data. Embedded within a universal pattern in which warm colors (reds, oranges) are always communicated more efficiently than cool colors (blues, greens), as languages increase in overall communicative efficiency about color, some colors undergo greater increases in communication efficiency compared to others. Communication efficiency increases first for yellow, then brown, then purple. The present analyses and results provide a new framework for understanding the evolution of color terms: what varies among cultures is not whether colors are seen differently, but the extent to which color is useful.},

 abstract = {Abstract Paleontological data from Palaeolithic sites in the Transbaikal region are frequently interpreted from the viewpoint of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. This research describes faunal material from one of the largest Initial Upper Palaeolithic settlements in Transbaikalia Podzvonkaya and the general characteristics of ancient human hunting activity there. The archaeological context of the faunal remains (located near hearths and in the kitchen midden) indicates the bones at the site are kitchen waste. The species composition indicates which species Podzvonkaya's inhabitants preferred to hunt. The largest number of remains belongs to horse, argali, bison, and Mongolian gazelle—animals that prefer open steppe and dry‐steppe landscapes. The results of a spore‐and‐pollen analysis of Podzvonkaya deposits reveal the domination of grass flora. The Tamir River valley could have been the habitat of the main target species, and ancient people probably hunted in the territory within the valley and in the valley's vicinity. Intraregional correlation with data on the species composition of the large mammals within other Palaeolithic remains of the Western Transbaikal region supports a conclusion regarding the identity of fauna at the final stage of the late Neopleistocene. Data from sites belonging to the same culture and period reveal identical prey lists, with certain preferences explained by site type (ie, long‐term base settlement or short‐term hunting camp).},

 abstract = {Early modern humans (EMH) are often touted as behaviorally advanced to Neandertals, with more sophisticated technologies, expanded resource exploitation, and more complex clothing production. However, recent analyses have indicated that Neandertals were more nuanced in their behavioral adaptations, with the production of the Châtelperronian technocomplex, the processing and cooking of plant foods, and differences in behavioral adaptations according to habitat. This study adds to this debate by addressing the behavioral strategies of EMH (n = 30) within the context of non-dietary anterior tooth-use behaviors to glean possible differences between them and their Neandertal (n = 45) counterparts. High-resolution casts of permanent anterior teeth were used to collect microwear textures of fossil and comparative bioarchaeological samples using a Sensofar white-light confocal profiler with a 100x objective lens. Labial surfaces were scanned, totaling a work envelope of 204 x 276 μm for each individual. The microwear textures were examined for post-mortem damage and uploaded to SSFA software packages for surface characterization. Statistical analyses were performed to examine differences in central tendencies and distributions of anisotropy and textural fill volume variables among the EMH sample itself by habitat, location, and time interval, and between the EMH and Neandertal samples by habitat and location. Descriptive statistics for the EMH sample were compared to seven bioarchaeological samples (n = 156) that utilized different tooth-use behaviors to better elucidate specific activities that may have been performed by EMH. Results show no significant differences between the means within the EMH sample by habitat, location, or time interval. Furthermore, there are no significant differences found here between EMH and Neandertals. Comparisons to the bioarchaeological samples suggest both fossil groups participated in clamping and grasping activities. These results indicate that EMH and Neandertals were similar in their non-dietary anterior tooth-use behaviors and provide additional evidence for overlapping behavioral strategies employed by these two hominins.},

 abstract = {Comorbidity is common, affecting one-third or more of the global population; and recent co-prevalence estimates suggest that its presence is increasing. It is associated with substantial chronic illness burden, disability, high mortality, and high ongoing costs to the individual and the community, reflecting its substantial impact within and beyond the health care system. Thus, unravelling the causes of comorbidity currently ranks among the top priorities in clinical practice. However, there are currently few protocols and clinical practice guidelines that can be used to assist clinicians in treating comorbid conditions in a coordinated way. Instead, the guidelines and protocols have tended to focus on single disorders and they generally fail to take comorbidities into account. This has resulted in the comorbid disorders being treated as if they are isolated clinical entities, with each condition managed separately, often by different clinicians. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop new clinical practice guidelines and therapeutic approaches that do take comorbidity into account; especially in patients with highly prevalent and highly comorbid disorders.},

 abstract = {Analyses devoted to palimpsest dissection and archaeological assemblage formation are currently topics of growing interest in Palaeolithic research. For many researchers, it is becoming increasingly clear that the temporal dimension of archaeo-sedimentary deposits should not be overlooked, because approaches based on the analysis of diachronically deposited assemblages impede accurate behavioural interpretations. In this work, we present the results of the zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of faunal remains from several high-resolution analytical contexts defined by archaeostratigraphic techniques in Stratigraphic Unit Xa from the Middle Palaeolithic site of El Salt. Our main goal is to identify behavioural tendencies related to the treatment of animal resources at a temporal scale of analysis as close as possible to ‘ethnographic time’. The behavioural, spatial and temporal information resulting from this study and from previous works based on the lithic record is discussed in order to investigate the settlement dynamics of Neanderthal groups in the highlands of Alicante (southeastern Iberian Peninsula) during the MIS 3.},

 abstract = {<p>In the world of education methodologies play a major role in developing education. One is the methodology that explored guidance directly from the Qur�an. Reality on the ground shows that the implementation of education at every institution of Islamic education is less build philosophy and the foundation of Islamic education which scientifically refers to the Qur'an, so that akhlak education has not been implicated in both the concepts of Islamic education. As a result, the implementation of education at every educational institution does not make faith as the core of all educational activities that result in graduates do not have strong faith. This study uses literature review sourced from literature, both primary and secondary. In practice, researchers collected qualitative data that figured that described for later analysis. This research was around issues of moral education that takes the Koran as the ground, where the terms not be separated from interpretation. In this case the interpretation method used was thematic approach to interpretation, that interpretation <em>mau<span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span>�'i</em>, supported also by the interpretation and commentary <em>ijmali</em> and <em>ta<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span>lili</em>. This method is very adequate to assist researchers in finding the concept. As for analyzing the problem, the author uses inductive thinking, namely the synthesis of thinking which departs from the facts, data, cases and knowledge of a special nature, leading to general conclusions. This mindset is used to analyze the meaning of a text thoroughly and critically. The results of this study concluded that the methodology used in the Qur'an stresses character education through research on the verses that were <em>lafadz</em> '<em>Ya </em><em>ayyuh� al</em><em>-</em><em>ladz�na </em><em>�manu</em>' is the method of the command, method restrictions, method <em>targh�b</em>, and <em>tarh�b</em>, with all its meaning. The methodology used commands and prohibitions of the Qur'an is at once set contemplates the good and true, and these methods also determine a benchmark of evils and abuses, these distinctive according to researchers. While the methodology is a method <em>tarh�b</em> and <em>targh�b</em> and supporters of the two previous methods. Methods <em>targh�b</em> and <em>tarh�b</em> in the process is more evocative work heart and soul of man as an essential component in human moral education. Methods <em>tarh�b</em> or <em>targh�b</em> in akhlak education is an educational method that can provide a sense of serving in the role of the appearance of <em>al</em><em>-</em><em>Raja</em> 'and <em>al</em><em>-</em><em>Khauf</em>, namely fear and hope to God that which both feel is important in the effort to build a good akhlak character. While the implementation of character education methodology derived from the Qur�an are in the world of education today, especially akhlak education, could be absorbed into the educational curriculum based on understanding of curriculum development at this time. Curriculum to accommodate the methodology in akhlak education, therefore, must first define and sort out the content set forth goodness and truth then inserted to these methods.</p><p class="keywords">Keywords: Ayat-ayat al-Qur�an, Pendidikan akhlak, orang-orang yang beriman</p>},

                  As economic games have spread from experimental economics to other social sciences, so too have critiques of their usefulness for drawing inferences about the “real world.” What these criticisms often miss is that games can be used to reveal individuals’ private preferences in ways that observational and interview data cannot; further, economic games can be designed such that they
                  do
                  provide insights into real-world behavior. Here, we draw on our collective experience using economic games in field contexts to illustrate how researchers can strategically alter the framing or design of economic games to draw inferences about private-world or real-world preferences. A detailed case study from coastal Colombia provides an example of the subtleties of game design and how games can be combined fruitfully with self-report data. We close with a list of concrete recommendations for how to modify economic games to better match particular research questions and research contexts.

The struggle of Sayyidana Husain as the everlasting history of humanity gives another view to the human concept and advance civilization.

 abstract = {Most people are aware of the health benefits of being physically active. The question arises then why people so easily fall into sedentary habits. The idea developed here is that sedentary behavior is part of a suite of behaviors to reduce levels of physical activity that were strongly selected in the evolutionary past, likely because high levels of physical activity had direct negative consequences for survival. However, hunter-gatherer populations could not reduce activity indefinitely because of the need to be active to hunt for, and gather food. Hence they never experienced low levels of activity that are damaging to health, and no corresponding mechanism avoiding low activity evolved. Consequently, gene variants promoting efficiency of activity and increased sedentariness were never selected against. Modern society facilitates reduced activity by providing many options to become less active and divorcing food intake from the need to be active. Choosing the less active option is hard wired in the genes; this explains why being sedentary is so common, and why reversing it is so difficult. Incentivizing activity may be enabled using modern technology, but ultimately may only end up replacing one set of health issues with others.

 abstract = {Adult honeybees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over 2 years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data show that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift toward high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease.},

Punishment by unaffected third parties has received extensive scientific scrutiny because third parties punish transgressors in laboratory experiments on behalf of strangers that they will never interact with again. Often overlooked in this research are interactions involving people who are not strangers, which constitute many interactions beyond the laboratory. Across three samples in two countries (United States and Japan; N = 1,294), we found that third parties’ anger at transgressors, and their intervention and punishment on behalf of victims, varied in real-life conflicts as a function of how much third parties valued the welfare of the disputants. Punishment was rare (1–2%) when third parties did not value the welfare of the victim, suggesting that previous economic game results have overestimated third parties’ willingness to punish transgressors on behalf of strangers.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A key feature of human life history evolution is that modern humans wean their infants 2-4 years earlier on average than African apes. However, our understanding of weaning variation in apes remains limited. Here we provide the first such report in chimpanzees by examining weaned age variation using long-term data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 41 years of observational behavioral data from 65 offspring of 29 mothers to examine the relationships between weaned age (defined as cessation of suckling) in wild chimpanzees and maternal age, dominance rank and parity, and offspring sex. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with mixed effects to model time to weaning and to examine potential sources of variation in offspring weaned age.
RESULTS: We found that male offspring were less likely than female offspring to wean by a given age and that weaned age of males varied more than weaned age of females. In addition, maternal dominance rank interacted with offspring age, such that low-ranking mothers were less likely to wean offspring early, but this effect decreased with offspring age.
DISCUSSION: We found that male offspring and offspring of low-ranking females were less likely to wean early, but did not find evidence for variable weaning according to maternal age or parity. As more data accumulate, we will be better able to disentangle the effects of maternal dominance rank, age and parity. Such studies will not only provide a richer understanding of living ape life history characteristics, but will also provide an important framework for understanding the evolution of early weaning in humans.},

There are numerous risk factors associated with the development of CRC, and the disease is more common in industrialized countries than it is in the developing world (1). Poor diet (in particular, a diet that is low in fiber and high in fat) appears to be a major influencing factor for disease development and progression, and recently it has been recognized that gut microbes may act as the interface between dietary factors and tumor development (reviewed in reference 3).

 abstract = {Each year in the United States, billions of dollars are spent combating almost half a million Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) and trying to reduce the ~29,000 patient deaths in which C. difficile has an attributed role (1). In Europe, disease prevalence varies by country and level of surveillance, though yearly costs are estimated at €3 billion (2). One factor contributing to the significant health care burden of C. difficile is the relatively high frequency of recurrent CDIs (3). Recurrent CDI, i.e., a second episode of symptomatic CDI occurring within 8 weeks of successful initial CDI treatment, occurs in ~25% of patients, with 35 to 65% of these patients experiencing multiple episodes of recurrent disease (4 , 5). Using microbial communities to treat recurrent CDI, either as whole fecal transplants or as defined consortia of bacterial isolates, has shown great success (in the case of fecal transplants) or potential promise (in the case of defined consortia of isolates). This review will briefly summarize the epidemiology and physiology of C. difficile infection, describe our current understanding of how fecal microbiota transplants treat recurrent CDI, and outline potential ways that knowledge can be used to rationally design and test alternative microbe‐based therapeutics.},

Bifidobacteriaceae represent critical early colonizers of the human gut, and the depletion of this microbial group in infants is correlated with allergy development. LAB+B are considered as one of the first human gut colonizers and recent studies have shown that humans might be exposed to them even in the womb.

While obesity was once thought to stem from a sedentary lifestyle and diets high in fat, recent evidence supports the idea that there is more complexity pertinent to the issue. The human gut microbiome has recently been the focus in terms of influencing disease onset. Evidence has shown that the microbiome may be more closely related to T2DM than what was originally thought. High fat diets typically result in poor microbiome heath, which then shifts the gut into a state of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis can then lead to metabolic deregulation, including increased insulin resistance and inflammation, two key factors in the development of T2DM. The purpose of this review is to discuss how microbiome relates to T2DM onset, especially considering obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation.},

 abstract = {Gut microbes play an essential role in the development and functioning of the human immune system. A disturbed gut microbiota composition is often associated with a number of health disorders including immune-mediated diseases. Differences in host characteristics such as ethnicity, living habit and diet have been used to explain differences in the gut microbiota composition in inter-continental comparison studies. As our previous studies imply that daily skin contact with organic gardening materials modify gut microflora, here we investigated the association between living environment and gut microbiota in a homogenous western population along an urban-rural gradient. We obtained stool samples from 48 native elderly Finns in province Häme in August and November 2015 and identified the bacterial phylotypes using 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We assumed that yard vegetation and land cover classes surrounding homes explain the stool bacterial community in generalized linear mixed models. Diverse yard vegetation was associated with a reduced abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto and an increased abundance of Faecalibacterium and Prevotellaceae. The abundance of Bacteroides was positively and strongly associated with the built environment. Exclusion of animal owners did not alter the main associations. These results suggest that diverse vegetation around homes is associated with health-related changes in gut microbiota composition. Manipulation of the garden diversity, possibly jointly with urban planning, is a promising candidate for future intervention studies that aim to maintain gut homeostasis.},

 abstract = {Nahdlatul Ulama, established on January 31, 1926, has affirmed his attitude of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah (Aswaja) by following al-Ash'ari and al-Maturidi. However, until now there has not been a comprehensive study of the arguments that form the backdrop of the theological decisions, but this issue is very urgent to find the answer. Everyone acknowledged the character, keulamaan, and heroism of KH Muhammad Hasyim Asy'ari. This paper describes the gait of the founder of Pesantren Tebu Ireng and also the Founding Fathers of Nahdlatul Ulama in defending Aswaja and analyzing the motivation behind it by using the theory of action motif according to Weber's perspective. By reviewing his works collected in Irshad al-Sary fi Jam 'Mushannafat al-Shaykh Hashim Ash'ari, it can be stated that KH Hasyim Asy'ari's argument for choosing Aswaja is his belief in the truth of Aswaja as the most surviving Islamic school of madhhab -the other theological ideology, Aswaja's position as al-sawad al-a'zham (the majority school of Muslims), and his understanding that maintaining Aswaja is a duty of the Muslims. Thus, the motivation tends to be based on religious values ​​in order to achieve goals according to normative idealism. The success of KH Hasyim Asy'ari in strengthening Aswaja with its moderating characteristics in Indonesia should be continued by Indonesian Muslims to be role models in promoting moderate and tolerant Islam.},

 abstract = {Percussion marks have been studied in the field of archaeology for more than a century. Researchers have identified, characterized and analysed them in order to distinguish them from traces of environment modification to bone and reconstruct hominin subsistence strategies. The multiplicity of studies based on percussion marks in different languages has led to a proliferation of different terminologies used for the same marks, especially in English. In addition, as a result of numerous experimental studies or ethnological observations, it is possible to accurately identify the different steps of the butchery process and each of the related marks. We know from experimental studies that the morphology of percussion traces inflicted by the same tools can differ as their morphology depends on many factors (i.e. location and intensity of blows, intrinsic bone variables). In addition to this, carnivore and hominin traces can be superimposed, which sometimes renders their interpretation difficult. Renewed interest in these percussion marks owing to the emergence of new technical means highlighted the need to review their classification and clarify the nomenclature. With this in mind, we reviewed the abundant scientific literature to propose a refined and descriptive nomenclature. The aim is to provide a coherent terminology for the description and analysis of impact fractures in different European languages. We also propose classifying percussion marks into three categories: (1) percussion marks sensu stricto, (2) traces consecutive to bone breakage and (3) striation marks related to marrow extraction.},

 abstract = {The possibility of cooperation and the stability of political order are long-standing problems. Polybius, well known for his Histories analysing the expansion of Rome and his description of the Roman constitution, also offers an intriguing social and political theory that covers ground from psycho-anthropological micro-foundations to institution-based political order, providing a genealogy of morals and political order that is best understood in game-theoretical terms. In this paper I try to give such an interpretation. Polybius’ naturalistic, proto-game theoretical views show similarities with Hume, Smith and especially Hobbes’ doctrine of sovereignty by acquisition. However, Polybius is original in crucial regards, giving a motivationally plausible account of institutional and especially constitutional solutions to moral and political problems. Constitutional order, for Polybius, embodies and makes possible in the first place a kind of political reason that cannot be had individually. Polybian political theory thus offers interesting solutions to problems concerning moral motivation, collective action, and the conditions for political order, as well as the explanation and character of institutions.},

 abstract = {New results from detailed zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of faunal remains from Loiyangalani are presented. The assemblage is well preserved but highly fragmented mainly as a result of anthropogenic processing. Results show that hominins exploited high-quality nutritional resources from small and large-sized ungulates. Overall, the assemblage is dominated by large-sized ungulates, which suggest were preferentially targeted. The fact that the site was strategically positioned along a wildlife migration corridor made their encounters always high and predictable. Feeding traces of both hominins and carnivores are also recorded. The abundance of butchery marks on high-meat and marrow-bearing bones suggests systematic butchery of the carcasses. The proportions of specimens bearing cut marks and percussion marks on long limb bones and the axial skeleton denote primary access to fully fleshed carcasses. Results also suggest carnivore mostly scavenged defleshed and demarrowed bone fragments discarded at the site.},

                  Horizontal Gene Transfer, the process by which bacteria acquire new genes and functions from non-parental sources, is common in the human microbiome
                  1,2
                  . If the timescale of HGT is rapid compared to the timescale of human colonization, then it could have the effect of ‘personalizing’ bacterial genomes by providing incoming strains with the genes necessary to adapt to the diet or lifestyle of a new host. The extent to which HGT occurs on the timescale of human colonization, however, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed 6,188 newly isolated and sequenced gut bacteria from 34 individuals in 9 human populations, and show that HGT is more common among bacteria isolated from the same human host, indicating that the timescale of transfer is short compared to the timescale of human colonization. Comparing across 9 human populations reveals that high rates of transfer may be a recent development in human history linked to industrialization and urbanization. In addition, we find that the genes involved in transfer reflect the lifestyle of the human hosts, with elevated transfer of carbohydrate metabolism genes in hunter gatherer populations, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among pastoralists who live in close contact with livestock. These results suggest that host-associated bacterial genomes are not static within individuals, but continuously acquire new functionality based on host diet and lifestyle.

 abstract = { Sri Lanka has produced the earliest clear evidence for Homo sapiens fossils in South Asia and research in the region has provided important insights into modern human adaptations and cultural practices during the last ca. 45,000 years. However, in-depth multidisciplinary analyses of Late Pleistocene and Holocene sequences remain limited to just two sites, Fa Hien-lena and Batadomba-lena. Here, we present our findings from the reinvestigation of a third site, Kitulgala Beli-lena. New chronometric dating from the site confirms the presence of humans as early as ca. 45,000 cal. BP. in the island’s Wet Zone rainforest region. Our analyses of macrobotanical, molluscan, and vertebrate remains from the rockshelter show that this early human presence is associated with rainforest foraging. The Late Pleistocene deposits yielded evidence of wild breadfruit and kekuna nut extraction while the Holocene layers reveal a heavy reliance on semi-arboreal and arboreal small mammals as well as freshwater snails as a protein source. The lithic and osseous artefacts demonstrate that populations developed a sophisticated tool kit for the exploitation of their immediate landscapes. We place the rich Kitulgala Beli-lena dataset in its wider Sri Lankan context of Late Pleistocene foraging, as well as in wider discussions of our species’ adaptation to ‘extreme’ environments as it moved throughout Asia.},

 abstract = {The stone artifact record has been one of the major grounds for investigating our evolution. With the predominant focus on their morphological attributes and technological aspects of manufacture, stone artifacts and their assemblages have been analyzed as explicit measures of past behaviors, adaptations, and population histories. This analytical focus on technological and morphological appearance is one of the characteristics of the conventional approach for constructing inferences from this record. An equally persistent routine involves ascribing the emerged patterns and variability within the archaeological deposits directly to long-term central tendencies in human actions and cultural transmission. Here we re-evaluate this conventional approach. By invoking some of the known concerns and concepts about the formation of archaeological record, we introduce notions of aggregates and formational emergence to expand on the understanding of how artifacts accumulate, what these accumulations represent, and how the patterns and variability among them emerge. To infer behavior that could inform on past lifeways, we further promote a shift in the focus of analysis from the technological and morphological appearance of artifacts and assemblages to the practice of stone use. We argue for a more rigorous and multi-level inferential procedure in modeling behavioral adaptation and evolution.},

Many field studies find that distributions of LRS among individuals are non-normal, zero-inflated and highly skewed. These results beg the question, what is the distribution of LRS predicted by demographic models when the only source of randomness is demographic stochasticity? Here we present the first exact analysis of the probability distribution of LRS for species described by age + stage models; our analysis starts with estimated vital rates. We illustrate with three examples: the Hadza, human hunter-foragers (age-only), the evergreen tree Tsuga canadensis (stage-only) and Roe deer, Capreolus capreolus (age + stage). For each we obtain the exact distribution of LRS, but also calculate and discuss the first three moments. Our results point to important questions about how such LRS distributions affect natural selection, and life history evolution.},

Alternatively, and most commonly, when there are no changes, we review the CH applications, features and pre/post-processing which make the algorithm suitable for its use. We analyse the dominant divides within ML, Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised, and reflect on a variety of algorithms that have been extensively used. From such an analysis, we give a critical look at the use of ML in CH and consider why CH has only limited adoption of ML.},

Such research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to medicine and from forensics to exobiology.

The dispositions would result from the internal architecture of the mind. In this article, I will argue that this disposition can be explained by various forms of (cultural) learning and not by the internal architecture of the mind. For my argument, I draw on new developments in predictive processing. I argue that CSR theories argue for the naturalness of religious belief in at least three ways; religious beliefs are adaptive; religious beliefs are the product of cognitive biases; and religious beliefs are the product of content biases. I argue that all three ideas can be integrated in a predictive coding framework where religious belief is learned and hence not caused by the internal architecture of the mind. I argue that the framework makes it doubtful that there are modular cognitive mechanisms for religious beliefs and that the human mind has a fixed proneness for religious belief. I also argue that a predictive coding framework can incorporate a larger role for cultural processes and allows for more flexibility.},

 abstract = { Plants have been a fundamental component of human diets over evolutionary time. However, plants pose dangers to humans due to the variety of toxic chemical and mechanical defenses they manufacture. Accordingly, recent developmental work has shown that infants exhibit a reluctance to touch plants—a behavioral strategy that is an effective way of mitigating plant dangers. A similar protective avoidance strategy occurs in the food domain, food neophobia, which can be reduced by social facilitation. In the current study we investigated whether infants modify their behavior toward plants when social information is present. We presented 8- to 18-month-olds with plants and control objects after an adult conveyed information about each object and measured infants’ touch behavior. The results provide the first evidence that social information reduces infants’ reluctance to touch plants and converge with previous findings that social facilitation reduces food neophobia. This provides a broader evolutionary framework for understanding food learning and food rejection early in life.},

According to some of these models, sheep would have diffused with Khoe-speaking people through southern Africa from around 2000 years ago. In the literature, ‘Khoe people’ and ‘herders’ or ‘pastoralists’ are often used as synonyms. Many implications follow from this and cast a shadow on the history of Khoe speakers in southern Africa. This paper critiques the correlation made between language groups, gene signatures and economies of subsistence before turning to a revaluation of the archaeological context of the early herding phase. The recent debates concerning the identification and dates of early sheep bones are discussed and integrated with the archaeological data relative to the appearance of herding practices.

 abstract = {The gut microbiome of long-lived people display an increasing abundance of subdominant species, as well as a rearrangement in health-associated bacteria, but less is known about microbiome functions. In order to disentangle the contribution of the gut microbiome to the complex trait of human longevity, we here describe the metagenomic change of the human gut microbiome along with aging in subjects with up to extreme longevity, including centenarians (aged 99 to 104 years) and semisupercentenarians (aged 105 to 109 years), i.e., demographically very uncommon subjects who reach the extreme limit of the human life span. According to our findings, the gut microbiome of centenarians and semisupercentenarians is more suited for xenobiotic degradation and shows a rearrangement in metabolic pathways related to carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Collectively, our data go beyond the relationship between intestinal bacteria and physiological changes that occur with aging by detailing the shifts in the potential metagenomic functions of the gut microbiome of centenarians and semisupercentenarians as a response to progressive dietary and lifestyle modifications.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The study of longevity may help us understand how human beings can delay or survive the most frequent age-related diseases and morbidities. In this scenario, the gut microbiome has been proposed as one of the variables to monitor and possibly support healthy aging. Indeed, the disruption of host-gut microbiome homeostasis has been associated with inflammation and intestinal permeability as well as a general decline in bone and cognitive health. Here, we performed a metagenomic assessment of fecal samples from semisupercentenarians, i.e., 105 to 109 years old, in comparison to young adults, the elderly, and centenarians, shedding light on the longest compositional and functional trajectory of the human gut microbiome with aging. In addition to providing a fine taxonomic resolution down to the species level, our study emphasizes the progressive age-related increase in degradation pathways of pervasive xenobiotics in Western societies, possibly as a result of a supportive process within the molecular continuum characterizing aging.},

 abstract = {The host-associated core microbiome was originally coined to refer to common groups of microbes or genes that were likely to be particularly important for host biological function. However, the term has evolved to encompass variable definitions across studies, often identifying key microbes with respect to their spatial distribution, temporal stability or ecological influence, as well as their contribution to host function and fitness. A major barrier to reaching a consensus over how to define the core microbiome and its relevance to biological, ecological and evolutionary theory is a lack of precise terminology and associated definitions, as well the persistent association of the core microbiome with host function. Common, temporal and ecological core microbiomes can together generate insights into ecological processes that act independently of host function, while functional and host-adapted cores distinguish between facultative and near-obligate symbionts that differ in their effects on host fitness. This commentary summarizes five broad definitions of the core microbiome that have been applied across the literature, highlighting their strengths and limitations for advancing our understanding of host-microbe systems, noting where they are likely to overlap, and discussing their potential relevance to host function and fitness. No one definition of the core microbiome is likely to capture the range of key microbes across a host population. Applied together, they have the potential to reveal different layers of microbial organization from which we can begin to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that govern host-microbe interactions.},

 abstract = {Background Dietary imbalance and harmful food substances are well established risk factors that can adversely impact human health. The gut microbiome is emerging as a new metabolic organ that can be serendipitously linked to these poor dietary outcomes. Modern manufactured foods and process ingredients can significantly alter gut microbiome composition and function, leading investigators to conclude that disruption of host-microbiome commensalism is a key mechanism in human disease linked to imbalanced diets or processed foods. Scope and approach In this review, we highlight disease-associated perturbations and precision manipulation of the human gut microbiome in the context of food and nutrition. We detail technical recommendations for evaluating food ingredient effects on gut microbiome composition and function, following Koch's principles of commensal postulates to evaluate whether reported findings can be implicated in disease causation. Strategies for minimizing and/or reversing diet/food ingredient-induced gut dysbiosis linked with human disease are also considered. Key Findings and Conclusions Current findings should encourage us to reevaluate the potential health hazards of modern food ingredients and processed foods by considering the involvement of the gut microbiome through well-established pipelines for deciphering the causality of a perturbated gut microbiome in disease induction.},

Resulting patterns might originate from different taphonomic problems, such as hominin-carnivore activities in alternate visits, and lead to interpretation issues. In this paper, we present a study of predepositional scattering activities caused by small-sized carnivores on simulated short-term hominin campsites. Their disrupting actions affect skeletal element survival considerably and, to a lesser extent, the spatial distribution of hearth-related assemblages. The results of this study demonstrate that small-sized carnivores might cause as much disruption as large-sized ones. Thus, being able to recognize these taphonomic processes and their consequences is critical when discerning between human and non-human behaviour.},

 abstract = {Intense exercise causes to organisms to have oxidative stress and inflammation at the gastrointestinal (GI) level. The reduction in intestinal blood flow and the exercise-linked thermal damage to the intestinal mucosa can cause intestinal barrier disruption, followed by an inflammatory response. Furthermore, the adaptation to exercise may affect the gut microbiota and the metabolome of the biofluids. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the presence of a GI derangement in hunting dogs through a non-invasive sampling as a consequence of a period of intense exercise in comparison with samples collected at rest. The study included nine dogs that underwent the same training regime for hunting wild boar. In order to counterbalance physiological variations, multiple-day replicates were collected and pooled at each experimental point for each dog. The samples were collected immediately at rest before the training (T0), after 60 days of training (T1), after 60 days of hunting wild boar (T2), and finally, at 60 days of rest after hunting (T3). A number of potential stress markers were evaluated: fecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) as a major indicator of altered physiological states, immunoglobulin A (IgA) as an indicator of intestinal immune protection, and total antioxidant activity [total antioxidant capacity (TAC)]. Since stool samples contain exfoliated cells, we investigated also the presence of some transcripts involved in GI permeability [occludin (OCLN), protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2)] and in the inflammatory mechanism [interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), calprotectin (CALP), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)]. Finally, the metabolome and the microbiota profiles were analyzed. No variation in FCM and IgA content and no differences in OCLN and CALP gene expression between rest and training were observed. On the contrary, an increase in PAR-2 and HO-1 transcripts, a reduction in total antioxidant activity, and a different profile of microbiota and metabolomics data were observed. Collectively, the data in the present study indicated that physical exercise in our model could be considered a mild stressor stimulus.},

 abstract = {BackgroundGut microbiota composition is known to depend on environmental (diet, day length, infections, xenobiotic exposure) and lifestyle (alcohol/drug intake, physical activity) factors. All these factors fluctuate seasonally, especially in areas with highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. Seasonal microbiota changes were reported in several previous studies. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether there is a seasonal variability in the gut microbiota composition in Ukrainian population. In contrast to previous studies performed on small-size samples using a longitudinal design, we used cross-sectional design with a large sample size (n = 769). Determination of microbial composition at the level of major microbial phyla was performed by qRT-PCR.ResultsThe relative abundance of major taxonomic groups of gut microbiota was found to be affected by month of sampling. Actinobacteria were more abundant and Bacteroidetes were less abundant in summer-derived samples compared to those obtained during other seasons, whereas Firmicutes content was seasonally independent. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in summer-derived samples than in winter-derived ones. Odds to have F/B > 1 were 3.3 times higher in summer samples and 1.9 times higher in autumn samples than in winter ones; neither age, nor sex were significant confounding factors.ConclusionsSeasonality of sampling could influence results of human microbiome research, thereby potentially biasing estimates. This factor must be taken into consideration in further microbiome research.},

 abstract = {<p>Aspects of human life history and cognition, such as our long childhoods and extensive use of teaching, theoretically evolved to facilitate the acquisition of complex tasks. The present paper empirically examined the relationship between subsistence task difficulty and age of acquisition, rates of teaching, and rates of oblique transmission among Hadza and BaYaka foragers from Tanzania and the Republic of Congo. We further examined cross-cultural variation in how and from whom learning occurred. Learning patterns and community perceptions of task difficulty were assessed through interviews. We found no relationship between task difficulty, age of acquisition, and oblique transmission, and a weak but positive relationship between task difficulty and rates of teaching. While same-sex transmission was normative in both societies, tasks ranked as more difficult were more likely to be transmitted by men among the BaYaka, but not among the Hadza, potentially reflecting cross-cultural differences in the sexual division of subsistence and teaching labor. Further, the BaYaka were more likely to report learning via teaching, and less likely to report learning via observation, than the Hadza, possibly due to differences in socialization practices. These findings suggest that patterns of transmission are highly variable across cultures.</p>},

 abstract = {In cooperative syntagmatic games, humans perform complex, intersubjective, ‘utterance’ chains that—when grammatically correct—output normatively valued meanings. The requisite performative behaviors maintain and reproduce social structures. To study this we must marry anthropological functionalism to syntagmatic semiotics, an approach envisioned by Ardener (1971b) that has several times almost emerged. To illustrate its power for political analysis, it is here first theoretically developed and then applied to describe a semiotic grammar likely shaped by selective pressures in the political sphere: the hospitality of Torguud nomadic herders (Mongolia). As shown, this grammar is responsible for reproducing that society’s economic/ecological adaptation. The mold of this analysis is then applied to examine a grammar in the proper (rather than extended) domain of politics: the egalitarianism of historically documented simple foragers, an imperfect yet useful model for the likely political grammar of ancestral human communities. In the hypothesis defended here (amending Woodburn 1982, Isaac 1987, and Gintis, van Shaik, & Boehm 2015), this egalitarian grammar emerged in a counterdominant social ecology brought about by the first projectile weapons, likely employed first against conspecifics rather than prey: stones. A similar material basis—modern, cheap, and accurate small firearms—is responsible, I claim, for the historical rise of a curiously similar egalitarian grammar that, since the late 19th c., has come to dominate politics in what are now (after Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan 2010) called WEIRD societies. Its consequences since 1848 have been so important that its recent evolutions deserve close study with syntagmatic-functional tools.},

Here we present the results of a 16-month behavioral study conducted on 22 wild infant olive baboons (Papio anubis) at the Uaso Ngiro Baboon Project, Kenya. This is the first study to examine the effects of maternal responsiveness and secondary attachments on the development of infant social behavior in a wild primate species that does not breed cooperatively. The data track maternal responsiveness and the rates of two behavioral indicators of infant social competence-orienting toward interactions and social play-over the course of the first year of life. Maternal responsiveness decreased as infants grew older, while infant orientation toward interactions and play behavior increased. Infants with poorly responsive mothers were more likely to have secondary attachments, and infants with secondary attachments to siblings oriented more frequently to social interactions than those with secondary attachments to adult/subadult males or with no secondary attachments. These findings indicate that variation in maternal responsiveness and presence of secondary attachments can influence the development of social competence in olive baboon infants.},

 abstract = {Although critical in understanding human societies relying on natural game stocks, little attention has been paid to how socioeconomic traits can influence hunter behaviour. Our research focuses on whether village size, household size and age, and hunter age and monetary income affect hunting efficiency (catch-per-unit-effort) and catchment areas of traditional Amazonians. In collaboration with 13 volunteer hunters from six villages, we assessed social traits, and identified hunting areas with GPS and animal kills over six months. Contrary to expectations from central-place foraging, hunters in larger villages used smaller catchment areas, potentially because cassava-associated game species are more common near larger villages. Older hunters were more efficient, emphasizing the role of experience gained through time. Catchment areas increased with hunters’ income, but apparently the hunting efficiency did not. Overall results support the notion that a spatial arrangement of fewer large villages, rather than many small ones, maximizes hunting efficiency and minimizes catchment areas.},

@article{pub.1127507824,
 abstract = { At least 37 genera of mostly large mammals went extinct toward the end of the Pleistocene in North America near the time of human arrival, and this general synchrony has long been argued to suggest human hunting (i.e., “overkill”) caused those losses. However, there exist only a few sites that securely document the human utilization of extinct megafauna, and this apparent scarcity—often referred to as the Associational Critique—remains the single most widely-cited, empirically-based objection to overkill. Some explain this scarcity as a function of taphonomic issues and sampling, suggesting few kill sites exist because the period of overlap between people and megafauna was so short. For some time, this argument we call the ‘Taphonomic Rebuttal’ has been challenged by observations that many extinct megafauna have rich late Pleistocene fossil records but are nonetheless poorly represented in archaeological contexts. Such analyses also suggest that surviving (extant) megafauna (e.g., deer [Odocoileus], bison [Bison], moose [Alces]) are overrepresented in archaeological faunas of the period relative to those that would ultimately go extinct. We build on these observations using a foraging theory framework that dictates such comparisons between paleontological and archaeological abundance records must be conducted with samples derived from similar chronological and geographical windows. Approached this way, we find that the number of secure archaeological associations known for any given megafauna taxon scales positively with their paleontological abundance. There is thus no systematic difference in the abundances of extant and extinct taxa in archaeological versus paleontological contexts as previous analyses have suggested, and thus no support for the Associational Critique from these data.},

Here, we report on our excavations and analyses of more than 400 Late Pleistocene human footprints from Engare Sero, Tanzania. The site represents the largest assemblage of footprints currently known from the human fossil record in Africa. Speed estimates show that the trackways reflect both walking and running behaviors. Estimates of group composition suggest that these footprints were made by a mixed-sex and mixed-age group, but one that consisted of mostly adult females. One group of similarly-oriented trackways was attributed to 14 adult females who walked together at the same pace, with only two adult males and one juvenile accompanying them. In the context of modern ethnographic data, we suggest that these trackways may capture a unique snapshot of cooperative and sexually divided foraging behavior in Late Pleistocene humans.},

 abstract = {Scale and tempo of brain expansion in the course of human evolution implies that this process was driven by a positive feedback. The "cultural drive" hypothesis suggests a possible mechanism for the runaway brain-culture coevolution wherein high-fidelity social learning results in accumulation of cultural traditions which, in turn, promote selection for still more efficient social learning. Here we explore this evolutionary mechanism by means of computer modeling. Simulations confirm its plausibility in a social species in a socio-ecological situation that makes the sporadic invention of new beneficial and cognitively demanding behaviors possible. The chances for the runaway brain-culture coevolution increase when some of the culturally transmitted behaviors are individually beneficial while the others are group-beneficial. In this case, "cultural drive" is possible under varying levels of between-group competition and migration. Modeling implies that brain expansion can receive additional boost if the evolving mechanisms of social learning are costly in terms of brain expansion (e.g., rely on complex neuronal circuits) and tolerant to the complexity of information transferred, that is, make it possible to transfer complex skills and concepts easily. Human language presumably fits this description. Modeling also confirms that the runaway brain-culture coevolution can be accelerated by additional positive feedback loops via population growth and life span extension, and that between-group competition and cultural group selection can facilitate the propagation of group-beneficial behaviors and remove maladaptive cultural traditions from the population's culture, which individual selection is unable to do.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota plays a role in gut-brain communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of gut microbiota composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the microbiota is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm.
METHODS: Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured.
RESULTS: Relative abundance of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut-brain module approach.
CONCLUSIONS: While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, in the human gut. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes.},

Recent years have seen a proliferation of empirical and theoretical work exploring the interplay between demography and CCE. This has generated intense discussion about whether demographic models can help explain historical patterns of cultural changes. Here, we synthesize empirical and theoretical studies from multiple fields to highlight how both population size and structure can shape the pool of cultural information that individuals can build upon to innovate, present the potential pathways through which humans' unique social structure might promote CCE, and discuss whether humans' social networks might partly result from selection pressures linked to our extensive reliance on culturally accumulated knowledge.},

 abstract = { The extraction of grease from deliberately comminuted cancellous bone is a low-return activity that has important evolutionary ramifications because it potentially constitutes an early form of resource intensification. From an archaeological standpoint, bone grease extraction is also of significance because it can substantially modify anatomical profiles. Whether this practice is a relatively recent phenomenon or has deep roots reaching back into the Paleolithic, however, remains controversial. The goal of this paper is to cast broader light on the emergence of bone grease procurement by briefly revisiting three French Middle Paleolithic sites (Roc de Marsal, les Pradelles and Grotte du Noisetier) that have been interpreted as potentially early evidence for human processing of cancellous bone for food. To determine whether the published patterns are consistent with this practice, faunal trends at these sites are compared here with recently acquired experimental and ethnographic data on bone comminution activities. The results presented in this paper emphasize the importance of considering human consumption of bone meal as a viable alternative when evaluating competing hypotheses to account for the frequent lack of articular ends in European Paleolithic sites, including many assemblages that show little evidence of carnivore intervention and density-mediated attrition. The analysis also highlights the significance of other activities such as soup making, the use of bone as fuel, ritual disposal of fragments, site cleaning and feeding dogs with pounded bones, which are possible sources of variation when interpreting highly fragmented faunal assemblages. These observations are integrated into a general model focused on the interpretation of bone processing in the archaeological record.},

 abstract = {BackgroundHuman-animal interactions with mutual benefits in the wild are rare. Such positive interactions seem to require an intricate knowledge from the human side on the animals’ behavior and their habitat. In southern Brazil, dolphins and human net-casting fishers have specialized in a cooperative foraging, in which fishers report being able to identify and name dolphins. Here, we evaluate the consensus in their ability to recognize the individual dolphins they interact with. By investigating the reliability of this recognition process, we assess the pros and cons of relying on the fishers’ traditional knowledge to further understand the behavior and ecology of dolphins at the individual level. We also assess the potential role of traditional knowledge for the maintenance of this unusual interaction.MethodsWe interviewed 38 fishers using a semi-structured questionnaire. During each interview, we evaluate their recognition ability of dolphins by showing high-quality photos of dorsal fins of different dolphins, asking questions about the dolphins’ behavior and traits, and about how fishers recognize each dolphin. We also evaluated information about the fishers. Different indices were used to measure the fishers’ ability to recognize dolphins via photos, and their consensus on individual identification. These indices were modeled as functions of traits of both dolphins and fishers to investigate which ones influence the recognition process.ResultsWe found that fishers can primarily recognize dolphins by natural marks in the dorsal fin but there was little consensus in recognition. Fishers also tend to repeat the name of the most “popular” dolphins for different photos, indicating low reliability in individual recognition. We also found that fishers who learned from relatives (vertical learning) how to interact with dolphins tend to be more accurate and have higher consensus in dolphin recognition than those fishers who learned from friends (horizontal learning) or individually.ConclusionArtisanal fishers have a deep understanding of the dolphins and the system they are inserted in. However, the lack of consensus in identifying individual dolphins herein reported indicates that using their traditional knowledge to further understand dolphin behavior and ecology at the individual level requires caution. Our study also suggests that the transmission of this tradition from parents to sons can be crucial to preserve such a unique human-animal positive interaction in its original form.},

What these criticisms often miss is that games can be used to reveal individuals' private preferences in ways that observational and interview data cannot; furthermore, economic games can be designed such that they <i>do</i> provide insights into real-world behaviour. Here, we draw on our collective experience using economic games in field contexts to illustrate how researchers can strategically alter the framing or design of economic games to draw inferences about private-world or real-world preferences. A detailed case study from coastal Colombia provides an example of the subtleties of game design and how games can be combined fruitfully with self-report data.

 abstract = { Background Microbiome research has focused on populations that are predominantly of European descent, and from narrow demographics that do not capture the socio-economic and lifestyle differences which impact human health. This limits our understanding of human-host microbiota interactions in their broadest sense. Here we examined the airway microbiology of the Orang Asli, the indigenous peoples of Malaysia. In addition to exploring the carriage and antimicrobial resistance of important respiratory pathobionts, we also present the first investigation of the nasal microbiomes of these indigenous peoples, in addition to their oral microbiomes.   Results  A total of 130 participants were recruited to the study from Kampung Sungai Pergam and Kampung Berua, both sites in the north-eastern state of Terengganu in Peninsular Malaysia. High levels of Staphylococcus aureus carriage were observed, particularly in the 18-65 age group (n=17/36; 47.2% 95%CI: 30.9-63.5). The highest carriage of pneumococci was in the <5 and 5 to 17 year olds, with 57.1% (4/7) and 49.2% (30/61) respectively. Sixteen pneumococcal serotypes were identified, the most common being the non-vaccine type 23A (14.6%) and the vaccine type 6B (9.8%). The nasal microbiome was significantly more diverse in those aged 5-17 years compared to 50+ years (p = 0.023). In addition, samples clustered by age (PERMANOVA analysis of the Bray-Curtis distance, p = 0.001). Hierarchical clustering of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores revealed six microbiome types. The largest cluster (n=28; 35.4%) had a marked abundance of Corynebacterium .   Others comprised Corynebacterium with Dolosigranulum , two clusters were definable by the presence of Moraxella , one with and the other without Haemophilus , a small grouping of Delftia/ Ochrobactum profiles and one with Streptococcus . No Staphylococcus profiles were observed. In the oral microbiomes Streptococcus, Neisseria and Haemophilus were dominant. Lower levels of Prevotella, Rothia, Porphyromonas, Veillonella and Aggregatibacter were also among the eight most observed genera.    Conclusions  We present the first study of Orang Asli airway microbiomes and pathobiont microbiology. Key findings include the prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes that would be covered by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines if introduced into a Malaysian national immunisation schedule, and the high level of S. aureus carriage. The dominance of Corynebacterium in the airway microbiomes is particularly intriguing given its’ consideration as a potentially protective commensal with respect to acute infection and respiratory health.  },

These data demonstrate the contraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer populations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with incoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic environments. We refine models for the spread of food producers into eastern and southern Africa, demonstrating more complex trajectories of admixture than previously suggested. In Botswana, we show that Bantu ancestry post-dates admixture between pastoralists and foragers, suggesting an earlier spread of pastoralism than farming to southern Africa.

 abstract = {The behavioural ecological approach to anthropology states that the density and distribution of resources determines optimal patterns of resource use and also sets its constraints to grouping, mobility and settlement choice. Central place foraging (CPF) models have been used for analyzing foraging behaviours of hunter-gatherers and drawing a causal link from the volume of available resources in the environment to the mobility decisions of hunter-gatherers. In this study, we propose a spatially explicit agent-based CPF model. We explore its potential for explaining the formation of settlement patterns and test its robustness to the configuration of space. Building on a model assuming homogeneous energy distributions, we had to add several new parameters and an adaptation mechanism for foragers to predict the length of their stay, together with a heterogeneous environment configuration. The validation of the model shows that the spatially explicit CPF is generally robust to spatial configuration of energy resources. The total volume of energy has a significant effect on constraining sedentism as predicted by aspatial model and thus can be used on different environmental conditions. Still the spatial autocorrelation of resource distribution has a linear effect on optimal mobility decisions and needs to be considered in predictive models. The effect on settlement location choice is not substantial and is more determined by other characteristics of settlement location. This limits the CPF models in analyzing settlement pattern formation processes.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Understanding the mechanisms by which organisms respond to environmental change is critical to conservation biology. Recent research indicates that the gut microbiome may mediate mammalian responses to the environment and can be used as a biomarker to understand host ecological strategies. Here, we explore the relationship between the gut microbiome, host dietary niche, and potential resilience to habitat alteration using two closely related, sympatric non‐human primate species: the tufted gray langur ( Semnopithecus priam ) and the purple‐faced langur ( Semnopithecus vetulus ). The gray langur is suspected to be a habitat generalist less perturbed by anthropogenic disturbance, while the purple‐faced langur is suspected to be a specialist more sensitive to disturbance. To test these characterizations, we assessed the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples collected from Kaludiyapokuna Forest Reserve, Sri Lanka (gray langur n  = 50 samples, purple‐faced langur n  = 7 samples). Our results demonstrate that despite strong gut microbial similarities, gray langurs had a more diverse gut microbiome that harbored Prevotella and Akkermansia , taxa involved in starch degradation, while the purple‐faced langur gut microbiome harbored Roseburia, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus, taxa involved in processing plant structural carbohydrates . Compared to related species in other locations, both Sri Lankan langurs harbored more pathogenic bacteria. These differences suggest that gray langurs have more generalist diets, making them more resilient to anthropogenic change, but also indicate that they are not impervious to human encroachment. Our findings suggest that microbiome analyses are an important tool for langur ecology and conservation, and should be integrated into ongoing studies. },

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of many infections is seasonal e.g. surgical site infections, urinary tract infection and bloodstream infections. We questioned whether there is seasonal variation even in climate-controlled hospitalized patients, and analyzed the influence of climate parameters on nosocomial bloodstream infections.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The retrospective cohort study is based on two databases: The German national surveillance system for nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICU-KISS) from 2001 to 2015 and aggregated monthly climate data. Primary bloodstream infection (PBSI) is defined as a positive blood culture with one (or more) pathogen(s) which are not related to an infection on another site and which were not present at admission. Monthly infection data were matched with postal code, calendar month and corresponding monthly climate and weather data. All analyses were exploratory in nature. 1,196 ICUs reported data on PBSI to KISS. The ICUs were located in 779 hospitals and in 728 different postal codes in Germany. The majority of the 19,194 PBSI were caused by gram-positive bacteria. In total, the incidence density of BSI was 17% (IRR 1.168, 95%CI 1.076-1.268) higher in months with high temperatures (≥20°C) compared to months with low temperatures (<5°C). The effect was most prominent for gram-negatives; more than one third (38%) higher followed by gram-positives with 13%. Fungi reached their highest IRR at moderately warm temperatures between 15-20°C. At such temperatures fungi showed an increase of 33% compared to temperatures below 5°C. PBSI spiked in summer with a peak in July and August. PBSI differed by pathogen: The majority of bacteria increased with rising temperatures. Enterococci showed no seasonality. S. pneumoniae reached a peak in winter time. The association of the occurrence of PBSI and temperatures ≥20°C was stronger when the mean monthly temperature in the month prior to the occurrence of BSI was considered instead of the temperature in the month of the occurrence of BSI. High average temperatures ≥20°C increased the risk of the development of a PBSI by 16% compared with low temperatures <5°C.
CONCLUSIONS: Most nosocomial infections are endogenous in nature; the microbiome plays a crucial role in host health. If gut and skin microbiome varies with season, environmental parameters will contribute to the observed incidence patterns. Similarly, the impact of global warming on both local weather patterns and extreme weather events may influence the acquisition of pathogens. A better understanding of the etiology of these infections is needed to provide guidance for future infection control strategies.},

 abstract = {The classification of hunter-gatherer societies as immediate-return or delayed-return offers a framework to explore variation in their adaptive strategies. Immediate-return societies would have evidence of limited food storage, sharing of resources, and high residential mobility. Archaeological attributes of an immediate-return society include the absence of formal storage facilities, artifact refits among dwellings indicating the sharing of resources, circular dwellings of small diameter, closely spaced dwellings, low density of artifacts without middens, low diversity of tools, generalized tools, and bifacial tools. The Elk Head site in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming provides an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that the site represents an immediate-return system. The results indicate that households at the site followed a variation of an immediate return adaptive strategy. The site inhabitants constructed basin dwellings in anticipation of later reuse and probably baked geophytes, mostly for immediate consumption as an adaptation to the dry mid-Holocene climate.},

 abstract = {The ketogenic diet has been used to treat intractable epilepsy for many years, yet the mechanism(s) underlying its effectiveness have not been completely elucidated. However, emerging evidence indicates that the ketogenic diet may correct or otherwise alter a 'dystopic' gut microbiota that exhibits altered fecal microbial composition compared to healthy individuals. Recent studies in animal seizure models also reveal altered gut microbiome, as well as changes in the composition of the microbiota after ingestion of a ketogenic diet. The effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in these animal models appears to be absolutely dependent upon the presence of gut microbiota. Further evidence suggests that effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in controlling seizures may be reliant upon the ability of specific bacterial populations to alter gamma glutamylation of amino acids and thus alter their uptake into the central nervous system. These studies suggest new directions for research in patients with epilepsy.},

Then, we discuss study design schemes, the methods of sample size calculation, and the methods for improving the reliability of research. We emphasize the importance of negative and positive controls in this section. Next, we discuss statistical analysis methods used in microbiome research, focusing on problems with multiple comparisons and ways to compare β-diversity between groups. Finally, we provide step-by-step pipelines for bioinformatics analysis. In summary, the meticulous study design is a key step to obtaining meaningful results, and appropriate statistical methods are important for accurate interpretation of microbiome data. The step-by-step pipelines provide researchers with insights into newly developed bioinformatics analysis methods.},

 abstract = {Homo sapiens evolved in East Africa and had dark skin, hair, and eyes, in order to protect against deleterious consequences of intensive UV radiation at equatorial latitudes. Intensive skin pigmentation was thought to bear the risk of inefficient vitamin D<sub>3</sub> synthesis in the skin. This initiated the hypothesis that within the past 75 000 years, in which humans migrated to higher latitudes in Asia and Europe, the need for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> synthesis served as an evolutionary driver for skin lightening. In this review, we summarize the recent archeogenomic reconstruction of population admixture in Europe and demonstrate that skin lightening happened as late as 5000 years ago through immigration of lighter pigmented populations from western Anatolia and the Russian steppe but not primarily via evolutionary pressure for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> synthesis. We show that variations in genes encoding for proteins being responsible for the transport, metabolism and signalling of vitamin D provide alternative mechanisms of adaptation to a life in northern latitudes without suffering from consequences of vitamin D deficiency. This includes hypotheses explaining differences in the vitamin D status and response index of European populations.},

En Gironde, l’analyse archéozoologique détaillée de Saint-Germain-la-Rivière et de Moulin-Neuf montre que les antilopes saïga étaient présentes dans cette zone saisonnièrement. Les hommes pratiquaient alors une chasse opportuniste à petite échelle sur les hardes mixtes présentes dans l’environnement. Le reste de l’année, ils continuaient à occuper la région en exploitant d’autres espèces (Cheval, Renne, Bovinés).},

 abstract = {Decades of research conducted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, & Democratic (WEIRD) societies have led many scholars to conclude that the use of mental states in moral judgment is a human cognitive universal, perhaps an adaptive strategy for selecting optimal social partners from a large pool of candidates. However, recent work from a more diverse array of societies suggests there may be important variation in how much people rely on mental states, with people in some societies judging accidental harms just as harshly as intentional ones. To explain this variation, we develop and test a novel cultural evolutionary theory proposing that the intensity of kin-based institutions will favor less attention to mental states when judging moral violations. First, to better illuminate the historical distribution of the use of intentions in moral judgment, we code and analyze anthropological observations from the Human Area Relations Files. This analysis shows that notions of strict liability—wherein the role for mental states is reduced—were common across diverse societies around the globe. Then, by expanding an existing vignette-based experimental dataset containing observations from 321 people in a diverse sample of 10 societies, we show that the intensity of a society's kin-based institutions can explain a substantial portion of the population-level variation in people's reliance on intentions in three different kinds of moral judgments. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that people's use of mental states has coevolved culturally to fit their local kin-based institutions. We suggest that although reliance on mental states has likely been a feature of moral judgment in human communities over historical and evolutionary time, the relational fluidity and weak kin ties of today's WEIRD societies position these populations' psychology at the extreme end of the global and historical spectrum.},

Here, we characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of fungal communities associated with the grapevine (grapes, flowers, leaves, and roots) and soils over an annual growth cycle in two vineyards to investigate the influences of grape habitat, plant developmental stage (flowering, fruit set, veraison, and harvest), vineyards, and climatic conditions. Fungi were influenced by both the grapevine habitat and plant development stage. The core microbiome was prioritized over space and time, and the identified core members drove seasonal community succession. The developmental stage of veraison, where the grapes undergo a dramatic change in metabolism and start accumulating sugar, coincided with a distinct shift in fungal communities. Co-occurrence networks showed strong correlations between the plant microbiome, the soil microbiome, and weather indices. Our study describes the complex ecological dynamics that occur in microbial assemblages over a growing season and highlight succession of the core community in vineyards.},

In this context, we evaluate guanacos’ hunting strategies and the role of terrestial environments for hunther-gatherers’ subsistence. We analyze and compare three archaeological assemblages corresponding to the Middle Holocene, located in different environments regarding their conditions for the transport and butchering of guanacos. The results show that hunting behaviors developed under different strategies according to each sector. This variability was not necessarily related to the differences in spatial and seasonal distribution of the resource, but to dissimilar contingencies or nutritional requirements of the human groups that inhabited these coasts during the Middle Holocene.},

Since its discovery, this Lower Palaeolithic open-air site has provided an interesting opportunity for the study of human behaviour during this early period of human evolution. Taphonomic studies conducted at the site, mostly of archaeosurface 3a in sector I, the level containing the most artefacts, have indicated that there was strong anthropogenic influence on the formation of the deposit, which is supported by the rich technological record. In this paper, we present a taphonomic study of the 3 colluvio level, in which bison is the most abundant taxon, and on which preliminary studies have highlighted the anthropogenic component. Our aim is to identify the involvement of hominins and carnivores in the accumulation, modification, and destruction of animal carcasses. The coexistence of hominins and carnivores is well-documented at the site, although co-occurrence of both predators over the same remains is rare. The almost total absence of modification on bone surfaces produced by hominins (cut marks) and carnivores (tooth marks) could be the result of taphonomic processes of alteration of bone surfaces, as hominins and carnivores seem to have acted as modificatory agents. Our study reveals that these groups probably acted independently, in different events, as part of the foraging and resources acquisition activities that these predators carried out in this environments.},

We find that this probability increases with the strength of demographic noise
under harsh conditions and peaks at either low, high, or intermediate switching
rates depending on both species' ability to withstand the harsh environment.
This complex relationship shows why finding patterns between environmental
fluctuations and diversity has historically been difficult. In parameter ranges
where the fittest species was most likely to be excluded, however, the beta
diversity in larger communities also peaked. In sum, how environmental
fluctuations affect interactions between a few species pairs predicts their
effect on the beta diversity of the whole community.},

We find that this probability increases with the strength of demographic noise under harsh conditions and peaks at either low, high, or intermediate switching rates depending on both species’ ability to withstand the harsh environment. This complex relationship shows why finding patterns between environmental fluctuations and diversity has historically been difficult. In parameter ranges where the fittest species was most likely to be excluded, however, the beta diversity in larger communities also peaked. In sum, how environmental fluctuations affect interactions between a few species pairs predicts their effect on the beta diversity of the whole community.},

 abstract = { Over the past two decades, taphonomic and zooarchaeological studies have focused on Neanderthal settlement patterns and subsistence strategies. The south-eastern margins of the Massif Central constitute one of the regions with the most abundant archaeological evidence of Neanderthal occupations in France. The faunal record of level 5 of Abri du Maras is a unique source of information for analysing Neanderthal behaviour at the end of the MIS 5. The assemblage is divided into three levels 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, which correspond to the three main phases of human occupation of the shelter in level 5. Through the taphonomic and zooarchaeological analysis of the faunal remains, we define the characteristics of human occupation developed in the rock shelter. In this paper, we show that Neanderthal groups used the Abri du Maras as a residential campsite for long-term occupation events during a whole season, mainly summer. The intensive exploitation of the faunal resources is typical of a residential campsite, and the selective seasonal hunting strategy of medium and large ungulates, centred on prime adults, indicates different Neanderthal subsistence patterns to the upper levels of the sequence. Here, our results document the chronological changes in occupation patterns in one of the reference sites in south-eastern France and address questions related to cultural choices and environmental constraints.},

 abstract = {Problems of dispersals of early hominins into Europe are widely discussed. In the Early Pleistocene, the dispersal of mammals and humans from Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe into the south of Western Europe passed mostly through the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Data on evolution and distribution of mammal faunas provide a solid basis for correlation and estimation of main dispersal events. In this paper authors made an attempt to analyze the paleobiogeographical aspects of possible hominin dispersals in the mid-Early Pleistocene of the Mediterranean in the context of a broad paleozoogeographical and paleoecological approach to addressing this issue. The study of the Early Pleistocene Trlica TRL11–10 mammal fauna of Trlica cave in Montenegro in the Central Balkans offers valuable information on biotic events in the region, migratory pathways and faunal transformations against a background of alternating environmental conditions. A recent discovery of several unique bones amongst other fossil mammalian remains excavated between 2010 and 2014 from the Trlica TRL11–10 level is of particular interest. The analysis of the assemblage of two large and two small bone artifacts suggests their anthropogenic nature. The Trlica TRL11–10 artifacts may constitute the first evidence of the initial ‘Peopling events’ in Mediterranean Europe. The artifacts are associated with a very diverse TRL11–10 fauna that includes 34 species of both small and large mammals and belongs to the late Early Pleistocene within the interval 1.8–1.5 Ma, Donau/Eburonian (MIS 63–51). The article emphasizes the close relationship between the early human dispersals and the evolution of biota and the importance of a holistic approach to the study of the problem of dispersals. Paleobiogeographic evidence confirms the possibility of the arrival of early hominins in the Balkans in the mid-Early Pleistocene, prior to 1.5 Ma, very likely closer to the Olduvai time.},

 abstract = {Dietary composition and antibiotic use have major impacts on the structure and function of the gut microbiome, often resulting in dysbiosis. Despite this, little research has been done to explore the role of host diet as a determinant of antibiotic-induced microbiome disruption. Here, we utilize a multi-omic approach to characterize the impact of Western-style diet consumption on ciprofloxacin-induced changes to gut microbiome structure and transcriptional activity. We found that Western diet consumption dramatically increased <i>Bacteroide</i>s abundances and shifted the community toward the metabolism of simple sugars and mucus glycoproteins. Mice consuming a Western-style diet experienced a greater expansion of <i>Firmicutes</i> following ciprofloxacin treatment than those eating a control diet. Transcriptionally, we found that ciprofloxacin reduced the abundance of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle transcripts on both diets, suggesting that carbon metabolism plays a key role in the response of the gut microbiome to this antibiotic. Despite this, we observed extensive diet-dependent differences in the impact of ciprofloxacin on microbiota function. In particular, at the whole-community level we detected an increase in starch degradation, glycolysis, and pyruvate fermentation following antibiotic treatment in mice on the Western diet, which we did not observe in mice on the control diet. Similarly, we observed diet-specific changes in the transcriptional activity of two important commensal bacteria, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>, involving diverse cellular processes such as nutrient acquisition, stress responses, and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. These findings demonstrate that host diet plays a role in determining the impacts of ciprofloxacin on microbiome composition and microbiome function.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Due to the growing incidence of disorders related to antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, it is essential to determine how our "Western"-style diet impacts the response of the microbiome to antibiotics. While diet and antibiotics have profound impacts on gut microbiome composition, little work has been done to examine their combined effects. Previous work has shown that nutrient availability, influenced by diet, plays an important role in determining the extent of antibiotic-induced disruption to the gut microbiome. Thus, we hypothesize that the Western diet will shift microbiota metabolism toward simple sugar and mucus degradation and away from polysaccharide utilization. Because of bacterial metabolism's critical role in antibiotic susceptibility, this change in baseline metabolism will impact how the structure and function of the microbiome are impacted by ciprofloxacin exposure. Understanding how diet modulates antibiotic-induced microbiome disruption will allow for the development of dietary interventions that can alleviate many of the microbiome-dependent complications of antibiotic treatment.},

Eubiotic lignocellulose is a useful source of dietary fiber for chickens; however, research on its effects on the gut microbiota and metabolism of chickens is limited. Moreover, the gut microbiota regulates the host metabolism, which generally depend on microbiotal metabolites—short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the SCFA receptors; however, related research reports on the SCFA receptors of chickens are lacking. Given this, we added three different levels of eubiotic lignocellulose (0%, 1%, and 2%) to the feed of ISA brown hens (IBH) for 0–8 weeks, with the aim of observing the effects of added eubiotic lignocellulose on the gut microbiota, SCFAs and its receptors and metabolism of chickens. </p><p><strong>Results: </strong>The results showed that the addition of eubiotic lignocellulose showed no significant difference among groups in terms of the growth performance, development of the cecum and microbial diversity of IBH (<em>P</em> &gt; 0.05), but significantly (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) increased the relative abundance of the excellent fiber-degradation bacterium<em> Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>, the acetate-producing bacterium <em>Sutterella</em> and<em> </em>fiber digestibility.

The addition of 1% eubiotic lignocellulose is more conducive to the fiber-degradation bacteria and the SCFA-producing bacteria, resulting in increasing of the production of SCFAs. However, because the difference of the concentration of SCFAs was not great among groups, there was no significant change in the growth performance of chickens, the development of the cecum and the relative expression of GPR43 mRNA, resulting in slight effects on the metabolism, including GLP-1 and PYY and the blood glucose and liver glycogen of chickens. Increasing our understanding of this would be beneficial to providing a theoretical basis for the application of eubiotic lignocellulose and improve the growth performance and health of chickens.</p>},

 abstract = {In order to find out about and discuss the peopling of the Americas, there is evidence that comes from a range of scientific disciplines. In archaeology, stone tool vestiges are one of the main pieces of evidence used for assessing the knowledge and understanding of this topic. One of the most iconic lithic remains from the South American Paleoindian record is the so-called Fishtail, or just “Fell” projectile point, a distinctive artifact that stands out due to its wide distribution from southern Mexico to southernmost South America. Different hypotheses have been proposed regarding its origin, mainly related to Paleoindian points from North America. In order to discuss this issue, special attention has been paid among the existing varieties to a group distributed throughout eastern North America, mainly in states with a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico. This group stands out, because with their narrow or broader blades, their lower portions typically have deeply indented concave edges, forming flaring rounded or pointed ears with fluted and unfluted bases which are reminiscent of the Fishtail. By comparing them from a morphological and technological viewpoint, and because of the observed similarities between North and South American fishtailed points, the hypothesis in this paper proposes that South American Fell points are related to similar ones from eastern North America. A model of the possible route/s followed by the waves of colonizers who peopled northern South America and the lands beyond the equator in the southern hemisphere is also proposed.},

                Here we explore how the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) and meteorological conditions combine in shaping the air microbiome in a heavily inhabited industrial urban settlement. During the observation time, the air microbiome was highly dynamic, fluctuating between different compositional states, likely resulting from the aerosolization of different microbiomes emission sources. This dynamic process depends on the combination of local meteorological parameters and particle emission sources, which may affect the prevalent aerosolized microbiomes. In particular, we showed that, in the investigated area, industrial emissions and winds blowing from the inlands combine with an airborne microbiome that includes faecal microbiomes components, suggesting multiple citizens’ exposure to both chemicals and microorganisms of faecal origin, as related to landscape exploitation and population density. In conclusion, our findings support the need to include monitoring of the air microbiome compositional structure as a relevant factor for the final assessment of local air quality.},

                  Sport und körperliche Aktivität haben nicht nur präventivmedizinische Bedeutung für die Gesundheit, sondern auch für die Leistungsfähigkeit des Immunsystems.

 abstract = {BackgroundVariability in the health effects of dietary fiber might arise from inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota’s ability to ferment these substrates into beneficial metabolites. Our understanding of what drives this individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework.ResultsArabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced α-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations (p = 0.012, Friedman’s test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in compositional shifts of the microbiota (p ≤ 0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes.ConclusionThis study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human intervention studies.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov, NCT02322112, registered on July 3, 2015.31V9H-jAy35CH_kWD2djd9Video Abstract},

Although the rumen microbiome in herbivorous ruminants has been studied intensively, there is a lack of data regarding the simultaneous adaption of the rumen and hindgut metagenome as affected by different feeding systems in extreme environments. Therefore, we studied the effects of two feeding systems, grazing and drylot, on the rumen and hindgut microbiome composition of semi-feral Tibetan goats kept at high altitude (~4800 m). 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analysis were conducted on DNA extracts from the contents and mucosal layer of different sections of the gastrointestinal tract (rumen, cecum, and colon).</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Intensive drylot feeding resulted in significantly higher zootechnical performance, narrower ruminal acetate: propionate ratios and a drop in the average rumen pH at slaughter to ~5.04. In response, the ruminal microbiome of drylot goats expressed a significantly lower diversity compared to the grazing animals. Otherwise, hindgut microbial adaption appeared to more diverse in the drylot group suggesting a higher influx of undegraded complex non-starch polysaccharides from the rumen. Despite their higher fiber levels in the diet, grazing goats exhibited lower counts of <em>Methanobrevibacter</em> and genes associated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway, presumably reflecting the scarce dietary conditions (low energy density) when rearing goats on pasture from extreme alpine environments. These conditions appeared to promote a relevant abundance of bacitracin genes, which potentially benefits the host's adaption to harsh environmental conditions. In parallel, we recognized a significant increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the digestive tracts of drylot animals.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>In summary, this study provides a deeper insight in the phylogenetic and functional adaption of the gastrointestinal microbiome of goats subject to intensive drylot and extensive pasture rearing conditions at high altitude.</p>},

 abstract = {Large felid predators have posed significant threats to various primate lineages since Miocene times. In the case of leopards (Panthera pardus), natural selection has fostered the ability to recognize these cats in a number of nonhuman primates. This perceptual ability is maintained in habitats where these predators are no longer present. In a similar domain, the hominin fossil record provides evidence of a long period of exposure to felid predators. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural selection engendered some evolved felid-recognition abilities in human ancestors. As explorations of this potential, experimental studies show that children and adults are capable detectors of lion images embedded in arrays of nondangerous antelope. In this chapter, the perceptual aspects of lions are investigated further by reviewing the neurobiological underpinnings of face recognition and shape and texture-processing which include the contextual associations that promote object recognition. Cave lions (Panthera spelaea) were an important component of cave drawings and mobiliary sculptures of Aurignacian hunter–gatherers in the early Upper Paleolithic of Europe. Some features of cave lions, such as facial markings and body contours are portrayed in drawings and figurines with anatomical realism, suggesting a level of visual salience that might be indicative of an evolutionary influence.},

 abstract = {Abstract The Middle East plays a central role in human history harbouring a vast diversity of ethnic, cultural and religious groups. However, much remains to be understood about past and present genomic diversity in this region. Here, we present for the first time, a multidisciplinary bioarchaeological analysis of two individuals dated to late 7th and early 8th centuries from Tell Qarassa, an open-air site in modern-day Syria. Radiocarbon dates, religious and cultural burial evidence indicate that this site represents one of the earliest Islamic Arab burials in the Levant during the Late Antiquity period. Interestingly, we found genomic similarity to a genotyped group of modern-day Bedouins and Saudi rather than to most neighbouring Levantine groups. This is highlighted through substantial Neolithic Levant ancestry in our samples, inviting an alternative scenario of long-term continuity in this region. This raises questions about the influence of ancient populations and historical migrations to genetic structure in the Middle East. As our study represents the first genomic analysis of an early Islamic burial in the Levant, we discuss our findings and possible historic scenarios in light of forces such as genetic drift and their possible interaction with religious and cultural processes.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the results of excavations conducted at the Late Gravettian site of Lubná VI in 2012 and 2018. This site is an exceptional example of a short-term Late Gravettian campsite, occupied between 27.5 and 27.1 ka cal BP. Due to the specific location of this site, in an area situated far from lithic raw material sources, the archaeological remains offer a rare possibility to understand the subsistence strategy of highly mobile hunter-gatherers in the Late Pleistocene. The knapped lithic assemblage is composed of erratic Cretaceous flint imported over long distances, and the tool inventory is typical of Late Gravettian assemblages from Central Europe, with a dominance of burins and backed implements. However, the lack of chert and flint raw material in the vicinity of the site inspired the occupants to use bladelet blanks to make hunting weaponry from burin spalls. This specific behaviour is unique among Gravettian inventories known from the western Carpathians. Reindeer dominate the faunal assemblage over other species. The season of occupation at Lubná VI was probably early autumn, and may be associated with the maximum use of environmental resources by the hunter-gatherers. The small campsite was located at a convenient spot for processing reindeer carcasses, where some hearth stone constructions were arranged. Because there was no woody vegetation in the closest vicinity of the site, reindeer bones and fat were used as fuel in hearths. Given the lack of nearby flint raw materials, the accessibility of large numbers of reindeer near Lubná, probably present on a seasonal basis, explains the occurrence of Late Gravettian occupation in this micro-region.},

Madurese humors are discourses that are not neutral; there are interests and intentions behind every discourse of humor that is set. Ethnic humor is formed by exploring the weaknesses of other ethic groups especially related to the character of the ethnic. This is a form of speaker superiority about the ethnic. This study uses a social paradigm, qualitative approach, and interviewing and observing data collection methods. Source of the data comes from documents and informants. Data were analyzed by applying critical discourse analysis of van Dijk. This theory divides a discourse into three part: text, social cognition and context. The results showed at least seven of Madurese stereotypes through humor. Of the seven, it is divided into two categories, which are based on the job: scrap metal collectors, female herbalist, religious man, and satay seller; and based on the characters, namely: dumbness, cleverness, and rudeness. This critical research proves the stereotype through humor is an attempt to perpetuate the culturally alienated position of Madurese race.},

It has been used for diverse cultural periods in various geographic regions of the world, but has only very recently been applied to the neotropics, and even more recently in Amazonia, for pre-Columbian sites now under rainforest. Through a few examples from French Guiana, this chapter focuses on the potential and limits of micromorpho-logical research to better understand the activities of pre-Columbian societies. In archaeological contexts, soil micromorphology is essential to distinguish between anthropogenic features and those derived from soil formation processes. It involves the identification, description and interpretation of the microscopic features and components of the different soils. It takes part of a global geoarchaeological and environmental analysis and can be applied to historical-ecological studies.},

 abstract = {Aside from complexity measured in levels of political integration, societies as systems of social institutions have another fundamental characteristic that can be called a “basic principle of societal organization.” The principle of organization a society embodies depends on the way its institutions are arranged with respect to one another. Two basic principles can be distinguished: heterarchy—the relation of elements to one another when they are unranked or can be ranked in different ways (as coined by Crumley), and its opposite, homoarchy,—a condition in society in which relationships in most contexts are ordered mainly according to one principal hierarchical relationship. Homoarchy and heterarchy represent the most universal “ideal” (generalized) principles and basic trajectories of socio-cultural organization. There are no universal evolutionary stages: cultures can be (generally) heterarchical or homoarchical having an equal level of complexity. A culture can change its basic organizational principle without transition to another complexity level. Alternativeness also exists within each of the types. So, the heterarchy—homoarchy dichotomy runs throughout the whole of human history: it is observable on all levels of social complexity in all historical periods and culture areas, including the globalized world of our time. Transformations in the ways social institutions and their sets, societal subsystems, are ranked (homoarchically or hetrarchically) on the one hand and changes in the overall cultural complexity on the other are two different, largely unrelated processes.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The food that people and animals consume leaves microscopic traces on teeth in predictable ways, and analyses of these markings-known as dental microwear analyses-allow us to reverse engineer the characteristics of diet. However, the microwear features of modern human diets are most often interpreted through the lens of ethnographic records. Given the subtle variation within human diets when compared to other species, we need better models of how foods and processing techniques produce marks on teeth. Here, we report on the second study to target the occlusal surface microwear of living human populations, and the first to target populations other than foragers.
METHODS: We collected 150 dental impressions from five Kenyan communities: El Molo, Turkana (Kerio), Luhya (Webuye), Luhya (Port Victoria), and Luo (Port Victoria), representing a range of subsistence strategies and associated staple diets-fishing, pastoralism, and agriculture. Our results suggest that the occlusal microwear of these groups records differences in diet. However, biofilm obscured most of the molds obtained despite the steps taken to remove it, resulting in only 38 usable surfaces.
RESULTS: Due to the biofilm problem and final sample size, the analysis did not have enough power to demonstrate the differences observed statistically. The results and problems encountered are here explained.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that in vivo studies of dental microwear texture analysis have the potential to increase our understanding of the association between patterns of dental microwear and complex, mixed human diets, resolution of the current pitfalls of the technique is critical.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota is a new frontier in health and disease. Not only many diseases are associated with perturbed microbiota, but an increasing number of studies point to a cause-effect relationship. Defining a healthy microbiota is not possible at the current state of our knowledge mostly because of high interindividual variability. A resilient microbiota could be used as surrogate for healthy microbiota. In addition, the gut microbiota is an "organ" with frontline exposure to environmental changes and insults. During the lifetime of an individual, it is exposed to challenges such as unhealthy diet, medications and infections. Impaired ability to bounce back to the pre-challenge baseline may lead to dysbiosis. It is therefore legitimate to postulate that maintaining a resilient microbiota may be important for health. Here we review the concept of resilience, what is known about the characteristics of a resilient microbiota, and how to assess microbiota resilience experimentally using a model of high fat diet challenge in humans. Interventions to maintain microbiota resilience can be guided by the knowledge of what microbial species or functions are perturbed by challenges, and designed to replace diminished species with probiotics, when available, or boost them with prebiotics. Fibers with multiple structures and composition can also be used to increase microbiota diversity, a characteristic of the microbiota that may be associated with resilience. We finally discuss some open questions and knowledge gaps.},

 abstract = {Many theories identify selfishness and lack of caring about others as the fundamental impediments to cooperation. We highlight a different source of non-cooperative behavior: People’s caring can be abundant but fail to activate. We present an attribution-based, game-theoretic model in which people may defect rather than cooperate even if they place little weight on self-interest, place much weight on reciprocating others, and recognize that they have been treated well. In the model, people consider others’ motives and often perceive two broad possibilities. Someone may treat another individual well out of genuine kindness or out of tactical self-interest, hoping to elicit and profit from a reciprocal response. The model formalizes the notion that when people construe positive treatment they receive as “just business” (i.e., motivated by tactical self-interest), their caring remains dormant, and they do not reciprocate. When they interpret positive treatment they receive as genuinely kind, their caring is activated, may be substantial, and they may reciprocate. We term non-reciprocity engendered by attributions of tactical motives “principled defection,” and we experimentally corroborate its prevalence. Our work indicates that existing research underestimates people’s taste for reciprocity. It yields novel perspectives on generosity in ultimatum games and unraveling in finitely-repeated interactions. It stands in opposition to the influential social heuristics hypothesis; a synthesis of our analysis and related theorizing on the norm of self-interest, reactive egoism, and sophisticated social inference offers an alternative explanation for findings cited as support for social heuristics.},

Metabolites, as the functional output of combined host and microorganism interactions, provide a snapshot in time of an extraordinarily complex multi-organism system. Although substantial work remains towards understanding host–microbiota interactions and the underlying mechanisms, we review the current state of knowledge for each of the major classes of microbial metabolites with emphasis on clinical and translational research implications. We provide an overview of methodologies available for measurement of microbial metabolites, and in addition to discussion of key challenges, we provide a potential framework for integration of discovery-based metabolite studies with mechanistic work.

The authors demonstrated the intestinal microflora connection with other organs and systems of the human body, including the immune and nervous systems, and determined its significance in the occurrence and development of common diseases. Special attention is paid to the analysis of pro-, pre-, metabiotics and their metabolites, which have individual differences in the metabolic processes of a healthy and sick organism.

 abstract = {Abstract
                  We propose a simple model of the emergence of equality before the law. A society can support effort (‘cooperation’, ‘prosocial behaviour’) using the carrot of future cooperation or the stick of coercive punishment. Community enforcement relies only on the carrot and involves low coercion, low inequality and low effort. A society in which elites control the means of violence supplements the carrot with the stick, and involves high coercion, high inequality and high effort. In this regime, elites are privileged by both laws and norms: because they are not subject to the same punishments as non-elites, norms are also more favourable for them. Nevertheless, it may be optimal—even from the elites’ perspective—to establish equality before the law, where all agents are subject to the same coercive punishments and norms are more equal. The key mechanism is that equality before the law increases elites’ effort, which improves the carrot of future cooperation and thus encourages even higher effort from non-elites. Equality before the law combines high coercion and low inequality. Factors that make equality before the law more likely to emerge include limits on the extent of coercion, greater marginal returns to effort, increases in the size of the elite group, greater political power for non-elites and, under some additional conditions, lower economic inequality.},

Despite this interest, a lack of studies have explored the whole genetic content of ancient latrine sediments through consideration not only of gut-associated parasites, but also of core community gut microbiome signals that remain from the group that used the latrine.

Nonetheless, statistical evaluation of potential association between nutritional status and bacterial abundance at both phyla and genus levels showed no significant difference. Further studies, ideally in both rural and urban areas, are needed to evaluate the role of the gut microbiome in the occurrence of obesity in PNG and other resource-limited settings.},

 abstract = {Hypothesis/Thesis Statement: The consumption of externally fermented foods acted as the initial metabolic trigger enabling hominid brain expansion. Because brain tissue is metabolically expensive, it is thought that the evolution of humans’ large brains was only possible through a concomitant reduction in the size of another expensive organ system, the gut. However, this gut reduction must have itself been made possible by dietary changes, the nature of which are still unclear. Here, we propose that the initial metabolic trigger of hominid brain expansion may have been the consumption of externally fermented foods. We define “external fermentation” as occurring outside the body, as opposed to the internal fermentation that occurs through the gut microbiome. This practice could have begun accidentally and with limited understanding, but over time, fermentation technologies may have become increasingly intentional, socially-transmitted, and culturally-reinforced. We detail the mechanisms by which external fermentation can mediate the evolution of increased brain size, as well as a reduction in gut size, by increasing the bioavailability of macro- and micronutrients while reducing digestive energy expenditure. Importantly, we calculate that the reduction in human gut size relative to modern apes is mainly due to a reduction in the colon, the site of internal fermentation. We also discuss the explanatory power of our hypothesis relative to others, including realistic plausibility in hominids with brains roughly the size of modern chimpanzees. Finally, we survey external fermentation practices across human cultures to demonstrate its viability across a huge range of environments, temperatures, and food sources. We close with suggestions for empirical tests.},

 abstract = {We consider the evolutionary scheme of morality proposed by Tomasello to defend the idea that the ability to orient the learning of offspring using signs of approval/disapproval could be a decisive and necessary step in the evolution of human morality. Those basic forms of intentional evaluative feedback, something we have called assessor teaching, allow parents to transmit their accumulated experience to their children, both about the behaviors that should be learned as well as how they should be copied. The rationale underlying this process is as follows: if a behavior is approved, then it is good; if it is disapproved, then it is bad. The evaluative guidance on how to behave most probably spread among peers in situations of mutual benefit, such as cooperative child rearing. We argue that our hominin ancestors provided with this capacity for assessor teaching were ideally positioned to develop the two specifically human levels of morality proposed by Tomasello: the morality of fairness and the morality of justice. Assessor teaching could have facilitated the genesis of rudimentary codes of behavior tied with the need to agree about how to behave to succeed in joint cooperative activities. Moreover, learning through assessor teaching provides a plausible explanation for the origin of the objectivist and prescriptive dimensions of human morality. First, we emphasize that individuals feel that they evaluate the behavior of others objectively to guide their learning, and, second, we underline the imperative intention that any moral manifestation possesses.},

 abstract = {The Olduvai Gorge is considered one of the most relevant archaeological complexes with regards to the study of our human evolution. This is especially evident when studying the emergence of hunting practices over the past 1.7 Ma. Butchery activities have been documented throughout Bed II, including the exploitation of megafauna in a larger number of sites. Among these, Hippopotamus, giraffe, sivatherium and large bovids have been documented to be consumed by hominins in, BK, TK, FLK-West and SHK between 1.3 and 1.7 Ma. Similar evidence has also been found in sites from Koobi Fora (Kenya), Peninj (Tanzania) and Ain Hanech (Marroco). Contrary to sites of lower Pleistocene earlier than 1.3 Ma, human butchery practices later than this are scarce during the transition between the Lower and Middle Pleistocene. This is due to a lack of sites with lithic tools associated with faunal remains during this period in Eastern Africa. The Acheulean site of Juma’s Korongo 2 (JK2) of the Olduvai Gorge Bed III is one of the few known sites with faunal remains associated with stone tools in East Africa. Under this premise, the present study therefore revisits the taphonomy of JK2, confirming that hominins had primary access to carcasses in this site, followed by carnivores. This is seen by a lower frequency of tooth marks contrary to previous studies of this same site, alongside the location and frequencies of cut and percussion marks on bone. This suggests early access to carcass by humans in the bone assemblage of JK2.},

These masked mycotoxins are less toxic, but their breakdown and release of unconjugated mycotoxins has been shown by mixed gut microbiota of humans and animals. The role of different bacteria in hydrolysing mycotoxin-glucosides is unknown, and this study therefore investigated fourteen strains of human gut bacteria for their ability to break down masked mycotoxins. Individual bacterial strains were incubated anaerobically with masked mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol-3-β-glucoside, DON-Glc; nivalenol-3-β-glucoside, NIV-Glc; HT-2-β-glucoside, HT-2-Glc; diacetoxyscirpenol-α-glucoside, DAS-Glc), or unconjugated mycotoxins (DON, NIV, HT-2, T-2, and DAS) for up to 48 h. Bacterial growth, hydrolysis of mycotoxin-glucosides and further metabolism of mycotoxins were assessed. We found no impact of any mycotoxin on bacterial growth. We have demonstrated that <i>Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens</i>, <i>Roseburia intestinalis</i> and <i>Eubacterium rectale</i> hydrolyse DON-Glc, HT-2 Glc, and NIV-Glc efficiently and have confirmed this activity in <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (DON-Glc only). <i>Prevotella copri</i> and <i>B. fibrisolvens</i> efficiently de-acetylated T-2 and DAS, but none of the bacteria were capable of de-epoxydation or hydrolysis of α-glucosides. In summary we have identified key bacteria involved in hydrolysing mycotoxin-glucosides and de-acetylating type A trichothecenes in the human gut.},

A majority of zooarchaeological research explores vertebrate taphonomy broadly by entire temporal levels of sites, thus aggregating multiple contexts by time period. Yet, an increasing number of high-resolution studies go beyond this level to explore taphonomy per context or by other meaningful intra-site divisions. This approach marshals the rich information offered by the well-established discipline of taphonomy to build depositional histories of site features that contain bones, thereby revealing their formation and use. Here, we aim to better formalize the definition of contextual taphonomy for zooarchaeology and demonstrate its great applicability through select case studies in Israel. In this of the approach for the Special Issue on “Contextual Taphonomy in Zooarchaeological Practice”, we lay out the main requirements for multi-scalar contextual analysis and caution against potential pitfalls. Ultimately, archaeofaunal taphonomic studies at the context level are pertinent for myriad research questions, including those of refuse maintenance, camp organization and feasting.},

Exposure to biodiverse, airborne microbial communities (aerobiomes) contributes to the development of healthy human-immune function. This overlooked but potentially powerful ecosystem service is akin to nature’s provision of traditional medicines and pharmaceutical compounds. But urban environments appear to support less diverse aerobiomes, suppressing this ecosystem service and potentially contributing to urban-associated diseases through altered immune function. Here, we synthesize the known relationships between aerobiome biodiversity and health and present the experimentally demonstrated mechanisms that connect aerobiome exposure to immune function. We then summarize what is currently known about the effect of urbanization on aerobiomes and identify several important knowledge gaps in this field, including a lack of rigorous, experimental, multi-scale studies demonstrating the mechanistic pathways between urbanization, altered aerobiomes and human health. We offer practical approaches that can close these knowledge gaps and will facilitate the transfer of knowledge and technology between microbiologists, urban ecologists and public-health practitioners. This synthesis should stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts to advance our understanding of how urbanization is impacting aerobiome ecosystem services, and what that means for human health.},

 abstract = {Most nonhuman primates prey on vertebrates. Meat-eating, defined as ingestion of vertebrate tissue, occurs in 12 families, ≥39 genera, and ≥89 species. It is most common in capuchins (Cebus and Sapajus spp.), baboons (Papio spp.), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and modestly common in blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), callitrichids (Callithrix spp. and Saguinus spp.), and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.). It is uncommon in other cercopithecines, rare in other haplorhines and in lemurs, and virtually absent in colobines. Birds are the prey class eaten by the most species (≥53), followed by reptiles (≥48), amphibians (≥38), mammals (≥35), and fish (≥7). Major hypotheses for the importance of meat eating are that it is (1) mainly an energy source, especially (1a) when plant-source foods (PSFs) with high energy return rates are scarce (energy shortfall hypothesis); (2) mainly a protein source; and (3) mainly a source of micronutrients scarce in PSFs. Meat eating bouts sometimes provide substantial energy and protein, and some chimpanzees gain substantial protein from meat monthly or annually. However, meat typically accounts for only small proportions of feeding time and of total energy and protein intake, and quantitative data are inconsistent with the energy shortfall hypothesis. PSFs and/or invertebrates are presumably the main protein sources, even for chimpanzees. Support is strongest for the micronutrient hypothesis. Most chimpanzees eat far less meat than recorded for hunter-gatherers, but the highest chimpanzee estimates approach the lowest for African hunter-gatherers. In fundamental contrast to the human predatory pattern, other primates only eat vertebrates much smaller than they are, tool-assisted predation is rare except in some capuchins and chimpanzees, and tool use in carcass processing is virtually absent. However, harvesting of small prey deserves more attention with reference to the archaeological and ethnographic record.},

The last ENI, published in 2004, was 28. Although the number of specimens recovered has almost doubled since then and more complete information is now available, this new analysis suggests that the ENI is 29. Some individuals are still represented by only one or a few teeth and the upper and lower jaws of various individuals have not been completed. We suggest that the amateur cavers, who accessed the SH site for years looking for bear fossils, destroyed a significant number of hominin fossils. Despite this, we have a good picture of the group of hominins represented in the SH assemblage. Because complete corpses were accumulated in SH and it is a closed cavity, it is expected that a significant number of hominin fossils remains to be discovered. According to the previous estimates, the representation of females is greater than that of males. However, the observed sex ratio is not significantly different from the 1:1 ratio. With the exception of the possible presence of a child individual, most of the remaining 28 individuals are teenagers or young adults (24/28 = 0.857). The ages of death of SH hominins appear to conform to a catastrophic profile.},

 abstract = {Abstract The reconstruction of perimortem and postmortem events is of critical importance to criminal investigations. In many cases, the information required for these reconstructions can be accessed through the analysis of skeletal remains. One particular class of skeletal data—trauma to the surfaces of bones, or bone surface modifications (BSMs)—can reveal much about the perimortem and postmortem intervals. While the study of BSMs originated within the fields of paleontology and archeology and was only later integrated into forensic science, a fruitful interdisciplinary exchange of data and methods is now commonplace. BSMs from thermal alteration, sharp‐force trauma, terrestrial and aquatic scavengers and predators, bacteria and fungi, insects, weathering, and sediment abrasion can supply investigators with valuable information about the agents and events of a corpse's deposition, including weapon type, local environmental conditions, the postmortem interval, and the presence, temperature(s), and/or length(s) of thermal exposure. Based on a review of this rich body of literature, we argue that (a) all associations between a BSM and its alleged source must rest on observational cause‐and‐effect studies; (b) secure identifications of BSMs should rely both on the intrinsic features of the modifications themselves and relevant contextual data; (c) the scientific validity of BSM research depends, ultimately, on rigorous blind‐testing and the establishment of error rates; and (d) researchers need to make a concerted effort to enhance interanalyst correspondence through objective definitions, measurements, and/or codes of BSM features. The most promising path forward lies in the combination of digital image analysis and multivariate predictive modeling.

 abstract = {The early, ephemeral adoption of pottery arose under different circumstances in both the Transbaikal and Russian Far East regions, however in both instances it was likely used to intensify extraction of more nutrients from resources already heavily in diets focused almost exclusively on riverine environments. In the Transbaikal, earliest ceramic use is correlated to an increase in residential mobility with no other technological or subsistence change. Ceramic vessels may have allowed more extensive processing of these food sources, including small mammals and fish, already in the foraging diet. In the Russian Far East, however, earliest ceramic use is correlated to higher rates of sedentism and ground stone technology, with intensification of land mammals in the Middle Amur Basin, and fish and C3 plant extraction in the Lower Amur Basin. Furthermore, it is clear that early on ceramics were incorporated ephemerally into behavioral systems throughout a relatively long period of time, thus the use of terminology such as “Final Late Paleolithic” and “Initial Neolithic” may only be descriptors of whether individual sites contain pottery, not a meaningful description of “cultures” or “time periods”. Thus, during the late Pleistocene, pottery may have been incorporated by hunter-gatherer-fishers into one behavioral system that initially comprised locations with and without ceramic use depending on the specific behavioral and environmental circumstances of the given region.},

The bipolar technique on anvil is well documented in Prehistory since the Lower Palaeolithic and is usually considered to be an expedient technique in comparison to other knapping systems. This technique plays a pivotal role in the Uluzzian techno-complex lithic production where it is largely used. In the present study, we analyse the anvils and hammerstones recovered in the Mousterian and Uluzzian layers of the site of Castelcivita (Campania region-southern Italy) by a multi-disciplinary approach. Our aim is to investigate the function and functioning of anvils and hammerstones by evaluating the presence and the role of bipolar knapping in these two assemblages. To do this, we integrated techno-functional analysis (sensu Boëda) and use-wear study, by defining each techno-functional unit (transformative and prehensile unities) of anvils and hammerstones and identifying the specific use-wear left by the bipolar technique by means of a dedicated experimental programme. The obtained results allowed us to observe different technical behaviours, concerning both the production and the use of hammerstones and anvils, between Mousterian and Uluzzian. Differences were encountered in the selection of raw material (limestone in the Uluzzian, sandstone in the Mousterian) and in the technical way of approaching the tool as well as in the function: the Mousterian anvil was used ‘as is’ for crushing materials, unlike the Uluzzian anvils which were exclusively employed for bipolar knapping, after adapting their original volume. Hammerstones were mainly used as pestles or retouchers in the Mousterian and for direct percussion in knapping activities during the Uluzzian.},

 abstract = {Syntagmatic functionalism provides theory and methods for the study of cooperative grammatical games, in which participants take turns making contributions to an unfolding inter-subjective behavioral chain or syntagm that, when well formed, outputs a normatively valued meaning (Gil-White 2020). Such games often contribute important system-supporting (structure-maintaining) functions. Political grammars are an important case in point. In extant NORMAL (Not Overly Ranked or Mechanized, Autochthonous Local) societies, political grammar is egalitarian. If such societies, and especially extant foragers, are useful models for the social organization of ancestral foragers, then human political grammar was long profoundly egalitarian. But in the last 10,000 years or so, in agricultural communities, hierarchy displaced egalitarianism — until modern times, when the political grammar in what are now called WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies (after Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan 2010) once again became egalitarian. This paper employs syntagmatic functionalism to isolate the one-sentence goal of egalitarian grammar in both WEIRD and NORMAL societies and identifies a material causal antecedent that is common to both. It argues, amending Woodburn (1982), Isaac (1987), and Gintis, van Shaik, & Boehm (2015), that ancestral NORMAL egalitarianism first emerged in a counter-dominant social ecology brought about by the first projectile weapon, likely employed first against con-specifics rather than prey: stones. Modern WEIRD egalitarianism was established in the People’s Spring uprisings of 1848, thanks — crucially — to the development and widespread availability of modern, cheap, and accurate small firearms.},

This is a very important issue, because one way to have more control over seasonal outbreaks is to understand the factors that underlie them. In this paper, I will evaluate the relevance of the microbiome as one of such factors. The paper is based on two pillars of reasoning. Firstly, on the idea that microbiomes play an important role in their hosts' defence against infectious diseases. Secondly, on the idea that microbiomes are not stable, but change seasonally. These two ideas are combined in order to argue that seasonal changes in a given microbiome may influence the functionality of the host's immune system and consequently make it easier for infectious agents to infect the host at certain times of year. I will argue that, while this is only a theoretical possibility, certain studies may back up such claims. Furthermore, I will show that this does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses aimed at explaining seasonal outbreaks; in fact, it may even enhance them.},

Although highly fragmented and affected by postdepositional processes it was possible to record several anthropization indicators related to the butchering process and thermo-alteration of remains by fire},

 abstract = {COVID-19 has been one of the most serious infectious diseases since the end of 2019. However, the original source, as well as the treatment and prevention of causative agent of COVID-19 (namely SARS-CoV-2) are still unclear nearly a year after its publicly report. The microbiome approach, which has emerged in recent years focusing on human-related microbes, has become one of the promising avenues for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of a variety of infectious diseases including COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the microbiome approach as a supplementary approach for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We first provided background information on SARS-CoV-2 and microbiome approaches. Then we illustrated current strategies of microbiome methods to assist three aspects of COVID-19 research, namely source tracking, treatment, and prevention, respectively. Finally, we summarized the microbiome approaches and provided perspectives for future studies on faster and more effective SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis based on microbiome approaches.},

 abstract = {<p><strong>Background: </strong>Although gut microbiota dysbiosis has been reported in HIV infected individuals recently, the relationship between the gut microbiota and immune activation in patients with different immune responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still not well understood. Gut microbiota and immune activation were studied in 36 non-HIV-infected subjects (healthy controls) and 58 HIV-infected individuals, including 28 immunological responders (IR) and 30 immunological non-responders (INR) (≥500 and &lt;200 CD4+ T-cell counts/µl after 2 years of HIV-1 viral suppression respectively) without comorbidities. </p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Metagenome sequencing revealed that HIV-infected immunological responders and immunological non-responders could not recover completely from the gut microbiota dysbiosis. At a 97% similarity level, the relative abundances of Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus and Megamonas were greater, whereas Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium rectale and Roseburia were more depleted in the IR and INR groups than those in the healthy controls. Ruminococcaceae and Alistipes were positively correlated with nadir and current CD4+ T-cell counts, but negatively correlated with CD8+CD57+ T-cell counts . Inflammation markers and translocation biomarkers (LPS) levels were positively correlated with the abundances of genus Ruminococcus and Fusobacterium but were negatively correlated with the genus Faecalibacterium . The relative abundances of Escherichia-Shigella and Blautia were significantly higher in the IR than those in the INR group. Escherichia-Shigella were negatively correlated with the CD4/CD8 ratio but positively correlated with the amount of C D8+CD57+ T-cells. Roseburia and Blautia were negatively associated with nadir CD4+ T-cell and positively associated with CD8+CD57+ T-cell counts. </p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Gut microbiota dysbiosis may be one of the factors contributing to different immune responses and treatment outcomes to HAART.</p>},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance leads to poor outcomes in cirrhosis. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is associated with reduction in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) burden in patients without cirrhosis; however, the impact in cirrhosis is unclear. We aimed to study the effect of capsule and enema FMT on ARG abundance in fecal samples, which were collected during two published FMT trials in patients with cirrhosis on rifaximin, lactulose, and proton pump inhibitors. ARGs were identified using metagenomics and mapped against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Changes in ARG abundance were studied within/between groups. The capsule FMT trial involved a one-time FMT or placebo capsule administration with stool collection at baseline and week 4 postintervention. Antibiotics+enema FMT included preprocedure antibiotics followed by FMT enema versus standard-of-care (SOC). Stool was collected at baseline, postantibiotics, and day 7/15 postintervention. Both trials included 20 patients each. There was no safety/infection signal linked to FMT. In the capsule trial, beta-lactamase (OXY/LEN) expression decreased post-FMT versus baseline. Compared to placebo, patients who were post-FMT had lower abundance of vancomycin (VanH), beta-lactamase (ACT), and rifamycin ARGs; the latter was associated with cognitive improvement. No changes were seen within patients treated with placebo. In the antibiotics+enema trial for postantibiotics at day 7 versus baseline, there was an increase in vancomycin and beta-lactamase ARGs, which decreased at day 15. However, quinolone resistance increased at day 15 versus baseline. Between SOC and FMT, day 7 had largely lower ARG (CfxA beta-lactamase, VanW, and VanX) that continued at day 15 (cepA beta-lactamase, VanW). No changes were seen within the SOC group. <i>Conclusion:</i> Despite differences in routes of administration and preintervention antibiotics, we found that ARG abundance is largely reduced after FMT compared to pre-FMT baseline and non-FMT groups in decompensated cirrhosis.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiome plays an important role in health and disease, but the archaeal diversity therein remains largely unexplored. Here we report the pioneering analysis of 1,167 non-redundant archaeal genomes recovered from human gastrointestinal tract microbiomes across countries and populations. We identified three novel genera and 15 novel species including 52 previously unknown archaeal strains. Based on distinct genomic features, we warrant the split of the Methanobrevibacter smithii clade into two separate species, with one represented by the novel Candidatus M. intestini. Patterns derived from 1.8 million proteins and 28,851 protein clusters coded in these genomes showed a substantial correlation with socio-demographic characteristics such as age and lifestyle. We infer that archaea are actively replicating in the human gastrointestinal tract and are characterized by specific genomic and functional adaptations to the host. We further demonstrate that the human gut archaeome carries a complex virome, with some viral species showing unexpected host flexibility. Our work furthers our current understanding of the human archaeome, and provides a large genome catalogue for future analyses to decipher its role and impact on human physiology.},

 abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that fat and carbohydrate interact to potentiate the reward value of food (DiFeliceantonio et al., 2018). The primary goal of the current study was to develop a novel picture set to facilitate research into the effects of macronutrient composition on food choice and eating behavior. Toward this aim, we developed "MacroPics." In Experiment 1, we photographed 120-kcal portions of 60 snack foods falling into one of the three macronutrient categories: (1) mostly carbohydrate, (2) mostly fat, or (3) a combination of fat and carbohydrate. Sixty-one participants rated the images for liking, familiarity, frequency of consumption, healthiness, estimated energy content (in kcal), and expected satiation. A subset of these images consisting of 36 items was then selected in an iterative process to minimize differences in ratings between the macronutrient categories while simultaneously ensuring similar within-category variability on a number of food characteristics (e.g., energy density, portion size, retail price) and visual properties (e.g., color, complexity, visual area). In Experiment 2, an independent sample of 67 participants rated the pictures of the final 36-item MacroPics. Both experiments reveal similar participant ratings across categories for item liking, familiarity, frequency, healthiness, and estimated energy content. Protein content was higher in the fat compared to the carbohydrate and combination categories, leading to higher ratings of estimated satiety and energy density for fatty foods. Item and macronutrient category characteristics of the final MacroPics set are reported.},

 abstract = {While it has been taken for granted in the development of several automatic facial expression recognition tools, the question of the coherence between subjective feelings and facial expressions is still a subject of debate. On one hand, the “Basic Emotion View” conceives emotions as genetically hardwired and, therefore, being genuinely displayed through facial expressions. Consequently, emotion recognition is perceiver independent. On the other hand, the constructivist approach conceives emotions as socially constructed, the emotional meaning of a facial expression being inferred by the perceiver. Hence, emotion recognition is perceiver dependent. In order (1) to evaluate the coherence between the subjective feeling of emotions and their spontaneous facial displays, and (2) to compare the recognition of such displays by human perceivers and by an automatic facial expression classifier, 232 videos of expressers recruited to carry out an emotion elicitation task were annotated by 1383 human perceivers as well as by Affdex, an automatic classifier. Results show a weak consistency between self-reported emotional states by expressers and their facial emotional displays. They also show low accuracy both of human perceivers and of the automatic classifier to infer the subjective feeling from the spontaneous facial expressions displayed by expressers. However, the results are more in favor of a perceiver-dependent view. Based on these results, the hypothesis of genetically hardwired emotion genuinely displayed is difficult to support, whereas the idea of emotion and facial expression as being socially constructed appears to be more likely. Accordingly, automatic emotion recognition tools based on facial expressions should be questioned.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Remarkably, the specifics of sleep along the human lineage have been slow to emerge, which is surprising given our distinct mental and behavioral capacity and the importance of sleep for individual health and cognitive performance. Largely due to difficultly of measuring sleep outside a controlled, clinical, and laboratory study in ambulatory individuals, human biologists have yet to undergo a thorough examination of sleep in ecologically diverse settings. Here, I outline the procedures and methods for generating sleep data in a broader ecological context with the goal of facilitating the integration of sleep and circadian analyses into human biology research.
METHODS: I describe the steps involved in participant recruitment, screening by way of survey instruments, and sample collection. In addition to describing field use of the traditional (but invasive) equipment such as the gold-standard application of electroencephalography (EEG), I demonstrate leading-edge noninvasive techniques for biometric devices (ie, wrist-worn actigraphy, ring worn arterial pulsometry) to generate sleep and circadian rhythms data.
RESULTS: I outline best approaches to process and analyze data-including variables such as sleep duration, 24-hour sleep time (ie, summation of night and day sleep), sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation, and nonparametric circadian rhythms analysis to quantify circadian amplitude. Finally, I discuss comparative statistical methods that are optimized for the use of time-series data.
CONCLUSIONS: This review serves as an introduction to the best practices for studying sleep-wake patterns in humans-with the goal of standardizing tools for launching new human sleep biology research initiatives across the globe.},

Technological advances from the past two decades have enabled the rapid expansion of our ability to characterize the human microbiome in depth, highlighting its previously underappreciated role in contributing to multifactorial diseases including those with unknown etiology. Consequently, there is growing evidence that the microbiome could be utilized in medical diagnosis and patient stratification. Moreover, multiple gut microbes and their metabolic products may be bioactive, thereby serving as future potential microbiome-targeting or -associated therapeutics. Such therapies could include new generation probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantations, postbiotics, and dietary modulators. However, microbiome research has also been associated with significant limitations, technical and conceptual challenges, and, at times, “over-hyped” expectations that microbiome research will produce quick solutions to chronic and mechanistically complex human disorders.

 abstract = {This volume presents a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in symbiosis research. It covers molecular, organellar, cellular, immunologic, genetic and evolutionary aspects of symbiotic interactions in humans and other model systems. The book also highlights new approaches to interdisciplinary research and therapeutic applications. Symbiosis refers to any mutually beneficial interaction between different organisms. The symbiotic origin of cellular organelles and the exchange of genetic material between hosts and their bacterial and viral symbionts have helped shaped the current diversity of life. Recently, symbiosis has gained a new level of recognition, due to the realization that all organisms function as a holobiome and that any kind of interference with the hosts influences their symbionts and vice versa, and can have profound consequences for the survival of both. For example, in humans, the microbiome, i.e., the entirety of allthe microorganisms living in association with the intestines, oral cavity, urogenital system and skin, is partially inherited during pregnancy and influences the maturation and functioning of the human immune system, protects against pathogens and regulates metabolism. Symbionts also regulate cancer development, wound healing, tissue regeneration and stem cell function. The medical applications of this new realization are vast and largely uncharted. The composition and robustness of human symbionts could make them a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting impending diseases, and the manipulation of symbionts could yield new strategies for the treatment of incurable diseases.},

 abstract = {Abstract Trading is a fabric of our lives, where lending and borrowing has become a contemporaneous product.  What remains constantly changing is the models and means in the transaction.  In this day and age, banks issues loans through credit cards to clients for financial transactions with fixed maturity dates and balance limits.  Cardholders will be penalized for late payment should the due amount is not settled within the given grace period.  Another example in trading activity is when a company seeks public loan funding to cover investment projects.  The capital transaction is offered in an exchange of returns in interests and derivatives awarded to participating clients for certain contract durations.  These are called interest-based banks. Since the beginning of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, Peace be upon him, prohibited this practice, which at the time was engaged by his uncle, Al-Abbas. Prophet Muhammad, Peace be upon him, firmly said: "The first usury I eliminated was the usury belonging to my uncle al-Abbâs". Islamic Sharia strictly forbids charging additional fees for loans given to borrowers. What is permissible is a business agreement is via capital cooperation and profit-sharing, following a mutual contract, and not by levying loan charges in form of additional fees.  This paper examines the problems from the perspectives of Islamic law by presenting the opinions of the schools of Fiqh and making comparisons based on the literature from each school of thought.

Sejak dulu model ini sudah ada sezaman dengan keberadaan manusia. Yang berubah hanya sarana dan model. Di zaman ini, pinjaman bank berupa kartu kredit yang memberikan pinjaman dana kepada nasabahnya untuk dipakai dalam transaksi keuangan dengan limit tertentu dan jangka waktu tertentu. Apabila waktu yang ditetapkan berakhir, maka nasabah dikenakan denda dengan kewajiban membayar uang yang dipinjamkan ditambah denda atas keterlambatan. Contoh lain, perusahaan besar membutuhkan dana besar untuk proyek bisnisnya. Ia memerlukan tambahan modal, lalu menawarkan kepada public untuk memberikan pinjaman dalam waktu yang ditentukan dengan perjanjian akan memberi imbalan berupa “bunga” atas keikut-sertaan itu. Inilah yang disebut dengan pinjaman berbunga. Sejak awal Islam, praktik ini dilarang oleh Rasul yang dulu dijalankan oleh pamannya sendiri al-Abbas. Dengan tegas Rasul mengatakan: “Riba pertama yang kuhapus ialah riba pamanku al-Abbas”. Syari’at Islam melarang keras untuk mengenakan biaya tambahan atas pinjaman yang diberikan kepada peminjam. Yang dibolehkan ialah perjanjian bisnis dengan bentuk kerjasama permodalan dan pembagian keuntungan sesuai kesepakatan, bukan pembebanan atas pinjaman dengan mengenakan tambahan biaya atas pinjaman. Makalah ini menelaah masalah tersebut dari sudut pandang Hukum Islam dengan menampilkan pendapat mazhab-mazhab Fiqh dan melakukan perbandingan berdasarkan literatur masing-masing mazhab.

 abstract = {The Mesolithic-Neolithic transformation was far more complex and variable process than previously hypothesised. The introduction of ceramic technology and initial pottery distributions in Eurasia show a wide-spread appearance of different pottery-making techniques and ornamental principles in different cultural and chronological contexts. The pattern cannot be explained by way of a narrow and gradual southeast - north west oriented spread of both people and vessels across Europe in the context of demic diffusion migratory model. The data indicate that ceramic technology was invented and reinvented more than once in different Palaeolithic and Neolithic contexts, and that hunter-gatherer communities made ceramic vessels elsewhere in Eurasia. Archaeogenetic data suggest that the processes of peopling Europe in prehistory were far more complex and variable than was first thought. The analyses of palimpsest of Ychromosomal paternal and mitochondrial maternal lineages in modern populations and of ancient DNA and palaeodemographic reconstructions show a complex picture of varied population trajectories elsewhere in Europe. Archaeological and biochemical data suggest that dairying and fermented milk consumption in Europe in Neolithic emerged before the genetic adaptation to milk culture.},

However, little is known about the spirochetes that naturally infect NHPs. Lyme disease and relapsing fever are caused by bacteria of the genus Borrelia, obligate parasites transmitted by arthropod vectors. Due to the close phylogenetic relationship of humans and NHPs and the importance of Borrelia infections in humans, translational NHP models have been developed. Leptospirosis, caused by different pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira, affects both humans and NHPs. Naturally acquired and clinically apparent leptospirosis is rare in NHPs. However, clinically healthy animals tested positive for antibodies against the spirochete, indicating that NHPs might function as a disease reservoir for humans. Syphilis, yaws, and bejel represent infections caused by bacteria of the genus Treponema. Naturally occurring Treponema infection in NHPs, as well as the continual use of NHPs as experimental models for human treponematoses, have been documented. This chapter discusses three groups of spirochetes that cause considerable diseases in NHPs in the context of naturally and artificially acquired infection: Borrelia, Leptospira and Treponema. Essential is the One Health concept that addresses the connection and spread of diseases between humans and NHPs.},

 abstract = {Moral nativism is a theory of moral cognition which holds that significant elements of human moral psychology are innate. In this invited chapter for The Oxford Handbook of Moral Psychology, I first summarize the intuitive turn in recent moral psychology and explain its significance for moral nativism. Drawing on an analogy to language, I then outline two principal arguments for moral nativism: the argument for moral grammar and the argument from the poverty of the moral stimulus. After making some terminological clarifications and correcting some popular misconceptions, I then review some of the most significant research supporting moral nativism, including empirical studies of compassion, empathy, and altruistic motivation in humans and other primates; the intuitive jurisprudence of young children; the emergence of moral cognition in human infants and toddlers; the neurocognitive foundations of moral judgment; and human moral universals. The chapter concludes by locating moral nativism within a broader historical and scientific context, including ancient philosophy (e.g., Plato’s Meno), Enlightenment rationalism (e.g., Descartes’ Treatise on Man), evolutionary theory (e.g., Darwin’s Descent of Man), and the modern cognitive science of innate knowledge.},

 abstract = {Previous researches have highlighted the finding that the availability of food resources plays an important role in reshaping the gut microbiota of wild animals as they to adapt to the surrounding habitat. The gut microbial characteristics were examined in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) from eastern China (Huangshan, Anhui), but little is known about other geographical populations. Herein, we collected 40 fecal samples of Tibetan macaques from the Labahe Natural Reserve in western China over four seasons and analyzed the seasonal variation of gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene V3–V4 sequencing. The analysis showed that gut microbial diversity and composition varied by season. Autumn exhibited the lowest alpha diversity and remarkably separated from the other three seasons for beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota during different seasons. Autumn presented the lowest Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio while winter had the highest. The family Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae within Firmicutes accounted for a high proportion in each season, but the abundance of Lactobacillaceae was significantly lower in winter. During autumn, Preotella, which can utilize carbohydrates increased significantly. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) prediction revealed that metabolism of cofactors of vitamin pathways and glycan biosynthesis pathways were highly enriched in autumn. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota potentially play an important role in the adaptation of wild Tibetan macaques to the seasonal fluctuations of food availability, which may contribute to the conservation of this endangered species.},

Here we examined the airway microbiomes of the Orang Asli, the indigenous peoples of Malaysia. A total of 130 participants were recruited from two sites in the north-eastern state of Terengganu in Peninsular Malaysia. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, the nasal microbiome was significantly more diverse in those aged 5–17 years compared to 50+ years (p = 0.023) and clustered by age (PERMANOVA analysis of the Bray–Curtis distance, p = 0.001). Hierarchical clustering of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity scores revealed six microbiome clusters. The largest cluster (n = 28; 35.4%) had a marked abundance of Corynebacterium. In the oral microbiomes Streptococcus, Neisseria and Haemophilus were dominant. Using conventional microbiology, high levels of Staphylococcus aureus carriage were observed, particularly in the 18–65 age group (n = 17/36; 47.2% 95% CI: 30.9–63.5). The highest carriage of pneumococci was in the <5 and 5 to 17 year olds, with 57.1% (4/7) and 49.2% (30/61), respectively. Sixteen pneumococcal serotypes were identified, the most common being the nonvaccine-type 23A (14.6%) and the vaccine-type 6B (9.8%). The prevalence of pneumococcal serotypes covered by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines support introduction into a Malaysian national immunisation schedule. In addition, the dominance of Corynebacterium in the airway microbiomes is intriguing given their role as a potentially protective commensal with respect to acute infection and respiratory health.},

 abstract = {Social learning and knowledge transmission mechanisms are known to have played a key role in human cultural evolution. Findings from Middle Pleistocene Qesem Cave (420–200 kya) suggest that the cave's inhabitants learned and shared knowledge about stone knapping and other adaptive skills throughout the recurrent human occupation of the cave. Here I present the results of a techno-typological and spatial analysis of over 1000 flint cores originating from 12 distinct lithic assemblages of the cave. I will argue that spatial expressions of clusters of cores reflecting skilled and unskilled knapping enable the characterization of social learning mechanisms practiced by the cave's inhabitants. My analysis suggests that different areas of the cave were dedicated to the initial stages of knapping and to the systematic, high skill production of laminar items. A unique group of cores reflecting both skilled and unskilled knapping was also identified, mainly in the vicinity of the hearth. Forms of learning included trial and error mechanisms and sharing of knowledge. These social learning mechanisms led to high proficiency in stone tool knapping and especially in laminar production – a significant technological innovation in the Levant at the end of the Lower Paleolithic period.},

 abstract = {Aim of the present study is to explore how the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) and meteorological conditions combine in shaping the air microbiome in Savona (Italy), a medium-size, heavily inhabited urban settlement, hosting a wide range of industrial activities. In particular, the air microbiome and PM10 were monitored over six months in 2012. During that time, the air microbiome was highly dynamic, fluctuating between different compositional states, likely resulting from the aerosolization of different microbiomes emission sources. According to our findings, this dynamic process depends on the combination of local meteorological parameters and particle emission sources, which may affect the prevalent aerosolized microbiomes, thus representing further fundamental tools for source apportionment in a holistic approach encompassing chemical as well as microbiological pollution. In particular, we showed that, in the investigated area, industrial emissions and winds blowing from the inlands combine with an airborne microbiome which include faecal microbiomes components, suggesting multiple citizens’ exposure to both chemicals and microorganisms of faecal origin, as related to landscape exploitation and population density. In conclusion, our findings support the need to include monitoring of the air microbiome compositional structure as a relevant factor for the final assessment of local air quality.},

 abstract = {This article aimed to describe Said Agil Siradj's (SAS’s) communication strategy at the anniversary of Fatayat NU in 2019. Radicalism and terrorism have become a real threat to world peace and human values. In Indonesia, it has been categorised as an extraordinary crime, particularly since the Bali bombings in 2002. The act of anticipation has been issued by forming anti-terrorism regulation to prevent and crackdown of its action. Nevertheless, this effort is not sufficient to eradicate terrorism action. Collaboration with religious institutions is needed to deal with the questions of the religious doctrines. Therefore, the participation of religious leaders from the Islamic organisations such as Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) is essential.. The study employs a descriptive qualitative approach of critical discourse analysis, focusing on the illocutionary acts of speech acts theory. The data of the research was transcribed from the video of SAS’s speech on YouTube channel. The result shows that the speaker used types of illocutionary acts; representatives, directives, commisives, expressives, and declarations. These expressions are used to command, persuade, and warn the listeners. Meanwhile, the Islamic terms were used as a discursive practice to maintain a good relationship between a leader and the followers.      Tulisan ini menjelaskan tentang bagaiamana Said Agil Siradj (SAS) mempengaruhi pendengarnya pada acara ulang tahun Fatayat NU ke-73 tahun 2019. Radikalisme dan terorisme telah menjadi ancaman bagi perdamaian dan nilai-nilai kemanusian. Di Indonesia, tindak terorisme telah menjadi bentuk kejahatan yang luar biasa sejak kejadian bom Bali 2002. Bentuk antisipasi telah dilakukan yakni dengan menerbitkan undang-undang anti-terorisme untuk menangkal dan mengatasi aksi terorisme. Penegakan hukum dan kebijakan regulasi telah dikeluarkan dalam rangka menangkalnya. Namun demikian, tindakan ini belum cukup memadai dalam pemberantasan terorisme. Kolaborasi dengan Lembaga-lembaga keagamaan diperlukan guna menjawab terkait doktrin-doktirn keagamaan. Oleh karena itu partisipasi para pemimpin agama dan organisasi keislaman seperti NU adalah penting. Namun demikian pelibatan organisasi keagamaan dalam kontek ini telah memicu munculnya perdebatan terutama Ketika organisasi tersebut mendominasi peran dalam ranah public.  Studi ini didesain berdasarkan deskripsi kualitatif pada pendekatan analisis wacana kritis yang berfokus pada tindak illokusi berdasarkan teori tindak tutur. Data penelitian ini diambil dari transkripsi Video SAS yang diambil dari YouTube. Selanjutnya data dianalisis menggunakan teori tindal ilokusi dan analsis wacana. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pembicara menggunakan tipe-tipe tindak tutur pada bentuk representasi, direktif, komisif, ekspresi dan deklarasi. Ekpresi-ekpresi tersebut digunakan untuk memerintah, membujuk dan melarang para pendengarnya.Adapun istilah-istilah keislaman digunakan sebagai praktik diskursif guna membangun hubungan social antara pemimpin dan pengikutnya.  },

 abstract = {Individuals vary widely in how they categorize novel and ambiguous phenomena. This individual variation has led influential theories in cognitive and social science to suggest that communication in large social groups introduces path dependence in category formation, which is expected to lead separate populations toward divergent cultural trajectories. Yet, anthropological data indicates that large, independent societies consistently arrive at highly similar category systems across a range of topics. How is it possible for diverse populations, consisting of individuals with significant variation in how they categorize the world, to independently construct similar category systems? Here, we investigate this puzzle experimentally by creating an online “Grouping Game” in which we observe how people in small and large populations collaboratively construct category systems for a continuum of ambiguous stimuli. We find that solitary individuals and small groups produce highly divergent category systems; however, across independent trials with unique participants, large populations consistently converge on highly similar category systems. A formal model of critical mass dynamics in social networks accurately predicts this process of scale-induced category convergence. Our findings show how large communication networks can filter lexical diversity among individuals to produce replicable society-level patterns, yielding unexpected implications for cultural evolution.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota composition is influenced by the diet as well as the environment in both wild and domestic animals. We studied the effects of two feeding systems on the rumen and hindgut microbiome of semi-feral Tibetan goats kept at high altitude (∼4800 m) using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Intensive drylot feeding resulted in significantly higher zootechnical performance, narrower ruminal acetate: propionate ratios and a drop in the average rumen pH at slaughter to ∼5.04. Hindgut microbial adaption appeared to be more diverse in the drylot group suggesting a higher influx of undegraded complex non-starch polysaccharides from the rumen. Despite their higher fiber levels in the diet, grazing goats exhibited lower counts of Methanobrevibacter and genes associated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway, presumably reflecting the scarce dietary conditions (low energy density) when rearing goats on pasture from extreme alpine environments. These conditions appeared to promote a relevant abundance of bacitracin genes. In parallel, we recognized a significant increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the digestive tracts of drylot animals. In summary, this study provides a deeper insight into the metataxonomic and functional adaption of the gastrointestinal microbiome of goats subject to intensive drylot and extensive pasture rearing conditions at high altitude.},

An association of higher expressing L/L and LA/LA variants of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was observed with homicidal behavior (bi-allelic: OR = 1.29, p = 0.016, tri-allelic: OR = 1.32, p = 0.015) and in the murderer group only with response to verbal abuse (OR = 2.11, p = 0.015), but not with other measures of self-reported aggression. L/L and LA/LA genotypes of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were associated with higher aggression scores on STAX1 scale of aggression compared to lower expressing genotypes (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG) in prison inmates. No associations were apparent for other serotonergic gene polymorphisms analyzed. Using the Braineac and GTEx databases, we demonstrated significant eQTL based functional effects for rs25531 in HTTLPR and other serotonergic polymorphisms analyzed in different brain regions and peripheral tissues. In conclusion, these findings implicate SLC6A4* HTTLPR as a major genetic determinant associated with criminal aggression.

 abstract = {Abstract   Across diverse societies, task assignment is a socialization practice that gradually builds children's instrumental skills and integrates them into the flow of daily activities in their community. However, psychosocial tensions can arise when cooperation is demanded from children. Through their compliance or noncompliance, they learn cultural norms and values related to autonomy and obligations to others. Here, we investigate task assignment among BaYaka foragers of the Republic of the Congo, among whom individual autonomy is a foundational cultural schema. Our analysis is based on systematic observations, participant observation, and informal interviews with adults about their perspectives on children's learning and noncompliance, as well as their own learning experiences growing up. We find that children are assigned fewer tasks as they age. However, children's rate of noncompliance remains steady across childhood, indicating an early internalization of a core value for autonomy. Despite demonstrating some frustration with children's noncompliance, adults endorse their autonomy and remember task assignment being critical to their own learning as children. We argue that cross‐cultural variation in children's compliance with task assignments must be understood within a larger framework of socialization as constituted by many integrated and bidirectional processes embedded in a social, ecological, and cultural context.   Abstract (French) Dans les diverses sociétés, l'attribution de tâches est une pratique de socialisation précieuse, qui permet de développer progressivement les compétences instrumentales des enfants et les intégrer dans le flux des activités quotidiennes de leur communauté. Dans cet article, nous concentrons notre analyse sur les aspects psychologiques et sociaux de l'attribution de tâches en tant que moments de tension psychosociale où la coopération est demandée aux enfants. En se conformant, ou en ne se conformant pas à ces demandes, ils apprennent les normes et valeurs culturelles liées aux droits individuels à l'autonomie en tension avec la responsabilité d'obéir. Dans le cadre d'une étude de cas, nous étudions les tâches assignées aux enfants parmi les chasseurs‐cueilleurs BaYaka de la République du Congo, parmi lesquels l'autonomie individuelle constitue un schéma culturel fondamental. Les observations comportementales quantitatives et systématiques des tâches assignées aux enfants BaYaka sont contextualisées à l'aide d'une recherche qualitative basée sur l'observation‐participante et des entretiens informels. Des entretiens ont été menés avec des adultes sur leurs perspectives concernant l'apprentissage et le non‐respect des tâches par les enfants, ainsi que sur leurs propres expériences d'apprentissage au cours de leur croissance. Nous avons constaté que les enfants se voient attribuer quantitativement moins de tâches au fur et à mesure qu'ils vieillissent. Cependant, le taux de non‐conformité des enfants reste stable tout au long de l'enfance, ce qui indique une intériorisation précoce de la valeur culturelle fondamentale que constitue l'autonomie. Bien que les adultes BaYaka aient manifesté une certaine frustration face au non‐respect des règles par les enfants, ils approuvent leur autonomie, se souvenant combien l'attribution des taches a été critique dans leur propre apprentissage quand ils étaient enfants. En se fondant sur cette analyse, nous avançons l'hypothèse que les variations interculturelles quant au respect des tâches assignées aux enfants doivent être comprises dans un cadre de socialisation élargi, constitué de nombreux processus intégrés et bidirectionnels ancrés dans un contexte social, écologique et culturel spécifique. },

 abstract = {Gut microbiota (GM) are important for the health of giant pandas (GPs), in addition to the utilization of bamboo in their diets. However, it is not fully understood how diet, habitat environment and lifestyle contribute to the composition of GM in GP. Consequently, we evaluated how dietary changes, habitat environment conversions and lifestyle shifts influence the GM of GPs using high-throughput sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics. The GM of GPs were more similar when their hosts exhibited the same diet. High fiber diets significantly increased the diversity and decreased the richness of gut bacterial communities alone or interacted with the age factor (p < 0.05). The abundances of Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium significantly increased during diet conversion process (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4). Reconstruction of 60 metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) indicated that these bacteria were likely responsible for bamboo digestion via gene complements involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin degradation. While habitat environment may play a more important role in shaping the GM of GP, lifestyle can also greatly affect bacterial communities. The GM structure in reintroduced GPs notably converged to that of wild pandas. Importantly, the main bacterial genera of wild GPs could aid in lignin degradation, while those of reintroduced GPs were related to cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium may contribute to lignocellulose digestion in GP.

 abstract = {Background The innovation of cultured meat has breathed new life into the human diet. It has gained media traction as one of the ways to reduce dependence on animal husbandry and slaughter, and environmental pollution related to meat processing. For Muslims, slaughtering of livestock is engrained in Islamic teachings primarily during two (2) occasions: the sacrifice of an animal on the event of a child's birth (aqiqa) and Festival of Sacrifice (Eid ul Adha) is a form of ritual before Allah, the Almighty. However, the question arises, once cultured meat commercialises and enters the market, will Muslims cease from slaughtering livestock? Scope and approach This commentary aims to answer the question by analysing two primary sources of Islam, namely the al-Quran and hadith, with further contextual substantiation from authoritative opinions of scholars. Key finding and Conclusion: Cultured meat has the potential to become an alternative to conventional meat in the market with conditions stipulated by Shariah guidelines. Nonetheless, the inevitable commercialisation of cultured meat cannot hinder Muslims from slaughtering livestock due to Islam's element of thawabit (immutable) with mandatory (wajib) adherence. The unprecedented advancements in science and technology shall not alter characteristics of thawabit (immutable) rulings.},

@article{pub.1134809806,
 abstract = {Abstract Long-term balancing selection (LTBS) can maintain allelic variation at a locus over millions of years and through speciation events. Variants shared between species, hereafter “trans-species polymorphisms” (TSPs), often result from LTBS due to host-pathogen interactions. For instance, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus contains TSPs present across primates. Several hundred TSPs have been identified in humans and chimpanzees; however, because many are in non-coding regions of the genome, the functions and adaptive roles for most TSPs remain unknown. We integrated diverse genomic annotations to explore the functions of 125 previously identified non-coding TSPs that are likely under LTBS since the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. We analyzed genome-wide functional assays, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We identify functional annotations for 119 TSP regions, including 71 with evidence of gene regulatory function from GTEx or genome-wide functional genomics data and 21 with evidence of trait association from GWAS and PheWAS. TSPs in humans associate with many immune system phenotypes, including response to pathogens, but we also find associations with a range of other phenotypes, including body mass, alcohol intake, urate levels, chronotype, and risk-taking behavior. The diversity of traits associated with non-coding human TSPs suggest that functions beyond the immune system are often subject to LTBS. Furthermore, several of these trait associations provide support and candidate genetic loci for previous hypothesis about behavioral diversity in great ape populations, such as the importance of variation in sleep cycles and risk sensitivity.  Significance statement Most genetic variants present in human populations are young (<100,000 years old); however, a few hundred are millions of years old with origins before the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. These trans-species polymorphisms (TSPs) were likely maintained by balancing selection—evolutionary pressure to maintain genetic diversity at a locus. However, the functions driving this selection, especially for non-coding TSPs, are largely unknown. We integrate genome-wide annotation strategies to demonstrate TSP associations with immune system function, behavior (addition, cognition, risky behavior), uric acid metabolism, and many other phenotypes. These results substantially expand our understanding of functions TSPs and suggest a substantial role for balancing selection beyond the immune system. },

 abstract = {The gut microbiota has been shown to play a role in energy metabolism of the host. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may predispose to obesity on the one hand, and stunting on the other. The aim of the study was to study the difference in gut microbiota composition of stunted Indonesian children and children of normal nutritional status between 3 and 5 years. Fecal samples and anthropometric measurements, in addition to economic and hygiene status were collected from 78 stunted children and 53 children with normal nutritional status in two regions in Banten and West Java provinces: Pandeglang and Sumedang, respectively. The gut microbiota composition was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The composition was correlated to nutritional status and anthropometric parameters. Macronutrient intake was on average lower in stunted children, while energy-loss in the form of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) appeared to be higher in stunted children. In stunted children, at the phylum level the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (44.4%) was significantly lower than in normal children (51.3%; p-value 2.55*10-4), while Firmicutes was significantly higher (45.7% vs. 39.8%; p-value 5.89*10-4). At the genus level, overall Prevotella 9 was the most abundant genus (average of 27%), and it was significantly lower in stunted children than in normal children (23.5% vs. 30.5%, respectively; q-value 0.059). Thirteen other genera were significantly different between stunted and normal children (q-value < 0.1), some of which were at low relative abundance and present in only a few children. Prevotella 9 positively correlated with height (in line with its higher relative abundance in normal children) and weight. In conclusion, Prevotella 9, which was the most abundant genus in the children, was significantly lower in stunted children. The abundance of Prevotella has been correlated with dietary fibre intake, which was lower in these stunted children. Since fibres are fermented by the gut microbiota into SCFA, and these SCFA are a source of energy for the host, increasing the proportion of Prevotella in stunted children may be of benefit. Whether this would prevent the occurrence of stunting or even has the potential to revert it, remains to be seen in follow up research.},

 abstract = {Bone surface modifications (BSMs) in faunal assemblages are frequently used to infer past agency and actions of hominins and carnivores, with implications for the emergence of key human behaviours. Patterning of BSMs has mostly been defined as a combination of the intensity of marks per bone portion and sometimes per element. Numerous variables involved in butchery can condition cut mark anatomical distribution, so much so that these variables are widely assumed to be stochastic. Here, we present a new methodological approach using a novel geospatial tool (Ikhnos) which combines the three-dimensional spatial documentation of cut mark patterns with spatial statistics based on wavelets, applied to three experimental and ethnoarchaeological faunal assemblages. We use wavelets to identify patterning of multiple longitudinal series of cut mark distributions on bones, and to establish similarities or differences in patterning within and across different assemblages. This method demonstrates the existence of general and behaviour-specific butchery patterns. It can also be used to effectively assess the proportion of mark clustering that is due to randomness, versus that which is conditioned by the butchery process.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe and discuss the strategies and technology implemented by Late Holocene hunter-gatherers to hunt their most prominent animal resources, guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and choique (Rhea pennata pennata), in different settings in the north margin of Lake Viedma (Santa Cruz province, Argentina). In order to do that, we use archaeological distributional data from different altitudinal levels, namely lakeshore dunes (255–275 m.a.s.l), mid-altitude plains or pampas (276–900 m.a.s.l.), and Del Tobiano basaltic plateau (≥900 m a.s.l.). The pampas, particularly the grounds below 400 m.a.s.l., may have been used by both species as their wintering grounds (although their permanence in this environment could have occurred throughout the year), while the mid-altitude plains and the plateau seem to have been primarily used by the guanaco as grazing and calving grounds from late spring to early fall, the months in which most of its surface is free of snow. Likely, differences in seasonality, topography and use of these environments by the guanaco and choique social groups may have forced people to adopt different hunting strategies, tactics and weaponry. Frequency variations in the presence of projectile points and bolas at different altitudinal levels have been observed. In the pampas, evidence suggests that guanaco hunting was aided by the use of bow and arrows and/or throwing weapons, such as spears and bolas, the latter likely also used in the hunting of choique. In the plateau, on the other hand, guanaco hunting tactics involved the use of blinds either by individuals or small groups of hunters who were mainly equipped with throwing weapons and/or bow and arrows. The archeological record of the plateau shows a logistic hunting-oriented strategy as well as a residential use during summer months. Artifact density and variety at lakeshore dunes suggest a greater intensity of occupation of these grounds, probably linked to a more residential use—either seasonal (fall/winter) or year-round—made possible by the availability, although in variable density throughout the year, of guanaco and choique. Consequently, the regional archeological landscape exhibits evidence of integration and complementarity of the different altitudinal levels in the northern margin of the Lake Viedma, at least during the Late Holocene.},

 abstract = {This study presents a discriminant analysis of projectile points (n = 44) from late Holocene contexts (~3100–400 cal BP) in the Argentine Andes (29–37° S). About two thousand years ago, the groups that inhabited the regions north and south of 34° S began divergent cultural histories. To the north, groups developed mixed economies that included domestic plants and animals. To the south, Patagonian hunters maintained their nomadic lifestyle until European contact. This study explores the geographic vectors and pace of the initial spread of the bow and arrow, if the bow replaced or coexisted with other weapon systems, and how these trends differed north and south of 34° S. We use Shott’s formula to metrically distinguish darts and arrows. Current data suggest that the bow was an innovation in the central Andes that rapidly spread south along the Andes to around 29° S at 3500–3000 cal BP. At this point, the tempo slowed dramatically. It was adopted by groups at 32° S around 1300 cal BP. At 37° S it arrived shortly after 1000 cal BP. Over the next two to three centuries, it was rapidly adopted by more sedentary food-producing groups north of 34° S as well as more mobile hunter-gatherers to the south. There is no evidence the bow was ever abandoned once adopted, and except in the case of Patagonia, it seems to have replaced previous weapon systems. This speaks to its versatility regardless of ecology, economic system, or cultural preferences.},

 abstract = {Paleofeces or coprolites are often used to reconstruct diet at archaeological sites, usually using macroscopic analyses or targeted DNA amplification and sequencing. Here we present an integrative analysis of dog coprolites, combining macroscopic analyses, stable isotope measurements, and DNA shotgun sequencing to examine diet and health status. Dog coprolites used in this study were recovered from the Janey B. Goode and East Saint Louis archaeological sites, both of which are located in the American Bottom, an extensive Mississippi River floodplain in Southwestern Illinois. Based on the context of recovery, coprolites are assigned to the Late Woodland and Terminal Late Woodland periods (ca. 600–1050 AD). Given the scarcity of human remains from this time period, these dog coprolites can be useful as a proxy for understanding human diet during the Late Woodland period. We find that the Late Woodland dogs consumed a variety of fish as well as bird and plant taxa, possibly including maize, and also harbored intestinal parasites and pathogenic bacteria. By sequencing the fecal microbiome of the coprolites, we find some similarities to modern dog microbiomes, as well as specific taxa that can be used to discriminate between modern and ancient microbiomes, excluding soil contaminants. As dogs are often used as a surrogate to assess human diet, humans living with these dogs likely had a similar diet and were affected by similar parasites. These analyses, when integrated, show a more comprehensive view of ancient dog and human diet and health in the region during the initial expansion of maize agriculture than any individual method could alone.},

This is likely achieved by an unprecedented genetic resource for fibrolytic enzymes of microbial origins that allow the host to efficiently degrade plant polysaccharides. However, to what extent of maternal symbiotic microbial transmission throughout early microbial successions and its adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in grazing yak driven by the harsh environment and nutritional stress have been far from clear.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Late Pleistocene and early Holocene in eastern Africa are associated with complex evolutionary and demographic processes that contributed to the population variability observed in the region today. However, there are relatively few human skeletal remains from this time period. Here we describe six individuals from the Kisese II rockshelter in Tanzania that were excavated in 1956, present a radiocarbon date for one of the individuals, and compare craniodental morphological diversity among eastern African populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used standard biometric analyses to assess the age, sex, and stature of the Kisese II individuals. Eastern African craniodental morphological variation was assessed using measures of dental size and a subset of Howells' cranial measurements for the Kisese II individuals as well as early Holocene, early pastoralist, Pastoral Neolithic, and modern African individuals.
RESULTS: Our results suggest a minimum of six individuals from the Kisese II collections with two adults and four juveniles. While the dating for most of the burials is uncertain, one individual is directly radiocarbon dated to ~7.1 ka indicating that at least one burial is early Holocene in age. Craniodental metric comparisons indicate that the Kisese II individuals extend the amount of human morphological diversity among Holocene eastern Africans.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that Late Pleistocene and early Holocene eastern Africans exhibited relatively high amounts of morphological diversity. However, the Kisese II individuals suggest morphological similarity at localized sites potentially supporting increased regionalization during the early Holocene.},

 abstract = {We hypothesize that megafauna extinctions throughout the Pleistocene, that led to a progressive decline in large prey availability, were a primary selecting agent in key evolutionary and cultural changes in human prehistory. The Pleistocene human past is characterized by a series of transformations that include the evolution of new physiological traits and the adoption, assimilation, and replacement of cultural and behavioral patterns. Some changes, such as brain expansion, use of fire, developments in stone-tool technologies, or the scale of resource intensification, were uncharacteristically progressive. We previously hypothesized that humans specialized in acquiring large prey because of their higher foraging efficiency, high biomass density, higher fat content, and the use of less complex tools for their acquisition. Here, we argue that the need to mitigate the additional energetic cost of acquiring progressively smaller prey may have been an ecological selecting agent in fundamental adaptive modes demonstrated in the Paleolithic archaeological record. We describe several potential associations between prey size decline and specific evolutionary and cultural changes that might have been driven by the need to adapt to increased energetic demands while hunting and processing smaller and smaller game.},

 abstract = {Dietary fiber has been linked to improved gut health, yet the mechanisms behind this association remain poorly understood. One proposed mechanism is through its influence on the secretion of gut hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). We aimed to: 1) investigate the impact of a fiber deficient diet on the intestinal morphological homeostasis; 2) evaluate L-cell secretion; and 3) to ascertain the role of GLP-1, GLP-2 and Takeda G protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) signaling in the response using GLP-1 receptor, GLP-2 receptor and TGR5 knockout mice. Female C57BL/6JRj mice (n = 8) either received a standard chow diet or were switched to a crude fiber-deficient diet for a short (21 days) and long (112 days) study period. Subsequent identical experiments were performed in GLP-1 receptor, GLP-2 receptor and TGR5 knockout mice. The removal of fiber from the diet for 21 days resulted in a decrease in small intestinal weight (p < 0.01) and a corresponding decrease in intestinal crypt depth in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively). Additionally, colon weight was decreased (p < 0.01). These changes were associated with a decrease in extractable GLP-1, GLP-2 and PYY in the colon (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01).

 abstract = {The human body is populated by myriads of microorganisms throughout its surface and in the cavities connected to the outside. The microbial colonisers of the intestine (microbiota) are a functional and non-expendable part of the human organism: they provide genes (microbiome) and additional functions to the resources of our species and participate in multiple physiological processes (somatic development, nutrition, immunity, etc.). Some chronic non-communicable diseases of developed society (atopias, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory diseases, cancer and some behaviour disorders) are associated with dysbiosis: loss of species richness in the intestinal microbiota and deviation from the ancestral microbial environment. Changes in the vertical transmission of the microbiome, the use of antiseptics and antibiotics, and dietary habits in industrialised society appear to be at the origin of dysbiosis. Generating and maintaining diversity in the microbiota is a new clinical target for health promotion and disease prevention.},

 abstract = {In the early Holocene period, extensive tracts of coastal land were submerged as the climate warmed and meltwaters flooded into the oceans. As the Irish Sea expanded, coastlines altered and large intertidal zones were created as tracts of low-lying land at the tidal margins were gradually submerged. In these areas, reed swamp and saltmarsh formed which, too, were inundated for varying periods of time. However, in the calmer warmer weather of the late spring and summer, birds and mammals were drawn on to the mudflats where they could feed on molluscs, or new reed and sedge shoots, wallow in the cooling mud, drink the brackish water or, for some predators, hunt. The behavioural tendencies of some species are revealed by their footprints which show their engagement within this environment – some breeds moved on to the marshes while others moved away. The humans who shared this landscape understood the opportunities offered by these predictable behaviours. Their trails run along and across those left by many species, leaving a visible network of human and animal activity preserved in the hardened mud. These will be described through an examination of the footprints recorded in three contexts which formed the stratigraphy of a Mesolithic bed at Formby Point in North West England. The persistent return to the mudflats by generations of people reflects an embodied knowledge of this coastal landscape, learnt in childhood and practiced in adulthood. The ability to modify movements in the landscape, to respond to the daily tides, the changing seasons and a fluctuating environment, all suggest a spatial-temporal relationship which not only encompassed a dynamic environment but also the other life that dwelt within it.},

This study differs in its investigation of the High Burrow Site (DhSh-2), a late Holocene coast-proximal inland camp at which terrestrial taxa comprised the majority of the faunal assemblage and Vancouver Island marmot (Marmota vancouverensis) was the most numerous taxon represented. Analysis of the marmot assemblage indicated that bone density mediated attrition influenced the relative abundance of skeletal elements more so than did the transport of marmot portions away from the site. The distribution of marmot bones at coastline sites supports this conclusion and may link changes in regional settlement patterning across south Vancouver Island with the decline of marmot hunting at High Burrow in the late prehistoric. This study thus draws our focus from coastlines upland to interior landscapes as vital components in the interpretation of prehistoric subsistence and settlement along the coast.},

 abstract = {The Associational Critique posits that extinct megafauna are scarce in North American late Pleistocene archaeological contexts, contrary to expectations of the overkill hypothesis. In an analysis focusing on the period of overlap between humans and megafauna, we revealed that no such underrepresentation of extinct taxa in kill/scavenging sites exists. Instead, we found a single positive trend between paleontological and archaeological occurrences for all megafauna taxa—extinct and extant—a pattern that is consistent with expectations from the prey model of foraging theory (Wolfe and Broughton, 2020). Grayson et al. (2021), while agreeing that such equated timescales should be used, question certain aspects of our analysis and use new datasets to reaffirm the premise of the Associational Critique. However, their analysis is problematic, as they use different criteria to assemble archaeological records for extant and extinct megafauna—more strict for the latter, thereby inflating the archaeological abundance of extant taxa. More critically, by using archaeological and paleontological data that align in time and space, there is no logical warrant for their argument that extinct forms should be underrepresented in kill/scavenging contexts because they “had either already disappeared or were much reduced in abundance by the time people arrived on the landscape” (Grayson et al., 2021). Using archaeological datasets that were assembled using the same stringent criteria and further refined timescales, we again find no support for such an underrepresentation nor the Associational Critique.},

Wolfe and Broughton (2020) assessed this critique on both theoretical and empirical grounds and found it wanting, with a focus on the arguments presented in Grayson and Meltzer (2015). We welcome their evaluation, including their effort to improve on our prior analyses. However, we are unconvinced by their assertion that hunters will always pursue large ungulates on encounter. We also reject their conclusion there is no systematic difference in the abundance of extant and extinct taxa in terminal Pleistocene archaeological contexts since they made two errors that undermine their analysis. First, they confounded calibrated and uncalibrated radiocarbon years. Second, they failed to note the parameters of the Cannon and Meltzer (2004) study on which their tally of archaeological kill/scavenging sites of extant taxa is based. With these mistakes corrected, the results confirm what we showed previously: extant large mammals occur in kill/scavenging sites far more often than extinct forms. This result also supports our previous suggestion that the now-extinct fauna had either already disappeared or was much reduced in abundance by the time people arrived on the landscape.},

There is evidence that they transported and systematically processed fleshed or relatively complete carcasses. The majority of the cut-marked elements are the high-meat and marrow-bearing bones.

In the first years of life, a healthy human gut microbiome changes in composition and shows an increase in complexity as it matures. A veritable industry has blossomed around direct-to-consumer microbiome sequencing. Fecal microbiota transplantation to treat recurrent infection with the bacterium Clostridium difficile represents a major success story in microbiome manipulation with clinical consequences.

Here, 91 stool samples from semicaptive bonobos and bonobos reintroduced in the wild, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, were screened for different infectious agents: viruses, bacteria and parasites. We showed the presence of potentially zoonotic viral, bacterial or parasitic agents in stool samples, sometimes coinfecting the same individuals. A high prevalence of Human mastadenoviruses (HAdV-C, HAdV-B, HAdV-E) was observed. Encephalomyocarditis viruses were identified in semicaptive bonobos, although identified genotypes were different from those identified in the previous fatal myocarditis epidemic at the same site in 2009. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. including symbiotic T. succinifaciens, T. berlinense and several potential new species with unknown pathogenicity were identified. We detected DNA of non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Salmonella spp. as well as pathogenic Leptospira interrogans. Zoonotic parasites such as Taenia solium and Strongyloides stercoralis were predominantly present in wild bonobos, while Giardia lamblia was found only in bonobos in contact with humans, suggesting a possible exchange. One third of bonobos carried Oesophagostomum spp., particularly zoonotic O. stephanostomum and O. bifurcum-like species, as well as other uncharacterized Nematoda. Trypanosoma theileri has been identified in semicaptive bonobos. Pathogens typically known to be transmitted sexually were not identified. We present here the results of a reasonably-sized screening study detecting DNA/RNA sequence evidence of potentially pathogenic viruses and microorganisms in bonobo based on a noninvasive sampling method (feces) and focused PCR diagnostics.},

Here, we review the neuroscience literature to examine whether neural processes associated with semantics are also involved in emotion. Our review suggests that brain regions involved in the semantic processing of words: (i) are engaged during experiences of emotion, (ii) coordinate with brain regions involved in affect to create emotions, (iii) hold representational content for emotion, and (iv) may be necessary for constructing emotional experience. We relate these findings with respect to four theoretical relationships between language and emotion, which we refer to as “non-interactive,” “interactive,” “constitutive,” and “deterministic.” We conclude that findings are most consistent with the interactive and constitutive views with initial evidence suggestive of a constitutive view, in particular. We close with several future directions that may help test hypotheses of the constitutive view.},

The GI tract represents a unique challenge to the mammalian immune system. The gut microbiota influences the health of its host by providing crucial benefits in the form of immune system development, prevention of infections, nutrient acquisition, and maintaining brain and nervous system functionality. Any imbalance in the composition and diversity in microbiota (dysbiosis) contributes to low-grade inflammation and increased gut permeability, resulting in neurological and visceral diseases.

However, these tools are still poorly known and no analysis was ever conducted for investigating their use. In this study, we present the results of the functional study performed on Mesolithic non-flaked stone artefacts from Pradestel and Romagnano Loc III, two sites located in the Adige Valley of the Eastern Alpine region of Italy. This area yielded some of the best-known Mesolithic record in Europe, and significant evidence of forager lifeways between the second half of the 10th millennium cal BC and the beginning of the 6th millennium cal BC. Through the application of qualitative and quantitative functional analyses we were able to interpret residues and use wear from the processing of plant and animal materials, finally assessing the activities performed with non-flaked stones at both sites. Our data provide the first direct evidence of the role played by little modified pebbles in the daily life of the Mesolithic foragers of the Italian Eastern Alpine region, so far assumed only through indirect evidence.},

We show that HGTs have accumulated in the microbiome over recent host generations and that HGT occurs at high frequency within individuals. Comparison across human populations reveals that industrialized lifestyles are associated with higher HGT rates and that the functions of HGTs are related to the level of host industrialization. Our results suggest that gut bacteria continuously acquire new functionality based on host lifestyle and that high rates of HGT may be a recent development in human history linked to industrialization.},

A single study published decades ago (Crader 1983) provides data about anthropogenic BSMs on bones of elephants butchered by Bisa people in Zambia, but no other studies with such details are available. By necessity, interpretations of BSMs on fossil proboscidean bones may be partly based on models derived from the skinning, meat-stripping (a.k.a. filleting), and dismemberment of nonproboscidean carcasses. Here we report BSMs on a sample of the largest limb bones and ribs from African elephant carcasses which were skinned, stripped of meat, and partly dismembered by expert butchers, and we also report BSMs unintentionally created by less skilled butchers. Based on observations and experiments, we predict how and why certain BSMs vary in placement and frequency due to butcher expertise and to different objectives of butchering, such as maximizing recovery of carcass resources for extensive or long term needs versus recovery of fewer resources sufficient for current needs. BSMs differ when soft tissue is removed from fresh versus partly decomposed or dried elephant carcasses. We compare our general observations with a sample of BSMs which have been interpreted as traces of meat-stripping or dismemberment in assemblages of extinct proboscideans Mammuthus spp. and Mammut americanum. The information about BSMs reported here may increase the interpretive potential of proboscidean assemblages.},

 abstract = {Whilst several explanations have been proposed for the absence of fire-related behaviours at well preserved Lower Palaeolithic sites, much of the emphasis of previous research has concentrated on our ability to find fire in the archaeological record. Furthermore, evolutionary models of early hominin fire engagement have often been developed and discussed in the context of early African hominins. Here we explore the role of fire in the behaviours, choices and lives of hominins during the earliest occupations of temperate regions, with a focus on Europe. We consider fire use in the context of Europe’s specific palaeoenvironmental conditions and discuss whether a long or short fire chronology model best fits the current evidence for the use of controlled fire in these regions during the Lower Palaeolithic. We propose two models for hominin fire behaviours in the temperate latitudes, using a heuristic ‘macroscale to microscale’ approach to understanding the needs for — and the use of — fire during this period. We argue that such holistic approaches must combine experimental work, experiential observations and cost-benefit approaches and should consider site context and function, fire function, social behaviour, and mobility, to evaluate the limited evidence for fire use in the Lower Palaeolithic. We highlight that, varying with seasonality, fire function (and the associated costs and benefits) was of particular importance and may explain the overall paucity of evidence for fire use in temperate regions prior to the Middle Palaeolithic. This has implications for other potential survival strategies that are invisible in the early archaeological record, such as shelter, clothing, and the putrefaction of meat for later consumption.},

However, the number of stone points that could have been used as projectiles fluctuates in archaeological assemblages, making it difficult to define when projectile technology was first widely adopted and how its usage changed over time. Here we use an agent-based model to simulate a hunter-gatherer foraging system where armatures are dropped according to their usage. We explore the impact of interactions between human behaviors and the environmental constraints of a data-informed landscape on the distribution and number of lithic armatures found in archaeological assemblages. We ran 2400 simulations modeling different population sizes, rates of hunting with projectiles, and tool curation levels. For each simulation, we recorded the location of dropped armatures and calculated the number and percentage of used armatures that were discarded at habitation camps vs. lost during hunting. We used linear regression to identify the demographic, behavioral, and environmental factor(s) that best explained changes in these numbers and percentages. The model results show that in a well-controlled environment, most armatures used as projectile weapons are lost or discarded at hunting sites; only ∼4.5% of used armatures (or ∼2 armatures per year of simulation) are discarded in habitation camps where they would likely be excavated. These findings suggest that even rare hafted armatures found in the Early and Middle Stone Age could indicate a well-established use of such tools. Our model shows that interactions between reoccupation of archaeological sites, population size, rate of hunting with projectile weapons, and tool curation levels strongly influence the count of lithic armatures found in archaeological assemblages. Therefore, we argue that fluctuations in the counts of armatures documented at archaeological sites should be evaluated within their demographic and environmental contexts to better understand if they reflect spatiotemporal changes in hunting behavior.},

 abstract = {Lactase persistence (LP) is a genetically-determined trait that is prevalent in African, European and Arab populations with a tradition of animal herding and milk consumption. To date, genetic analyses have identified several common variants that are associated with LP. Furthermore, data have indicated that these functional alleles likely have been maintained in pastoralist populations due to the action of recent selection, exemplifying the ongoing evolution of anatomically modern humans. Additionally, demographic history has also played a role in the geographic distribution of LP and associated alleles in Africa. In particular, the migration of ancestral herders and their subsequent admixture with local populations were integral to the spread of LP alleles and the culture of pastoralism across the continent. The timing of these demographic events was often correlated with known major environmental changes and/or the ability of domesticated cattle to resist/avoid infectious diseases. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis and evolutionary history of LP, as well as the factors that influenced the origin and spread of pastoralism in Africa.},

The standard narrative framework used in the science of emotion conceals meaningful variation within scientific traditions and obfuscates similarities, depriving both newcomers and scientists of effective conceptual tools for making scientific progress. In this chapter, we introduce a different narrative framework to reorganize the field according to the degree to which variation is hypothesized across instances that belong to the same emotion category (e.g., instances of anger), similarities across instances of different categories (e.g., instances of anger vs. instances of fear) and the causes of this variation. The newer narrative framework will help readers to make more informed measurement decisions, equipping them to properly evaluate theoretical assumptions and understand the consequences of their measurement choices.},

 abstract = {Spatial analysis studies in Palaeolithic archaeology arise as indispensable research tools for understanding archaeopalaeontological sites. In general terms, spatial studies have been specialised in the description of the distribution of materials and in the definition of accumulation areas, with the aim of distinguishing intentional activities or studying postdepositional processes. In recent decades, the development of GIS tools has enabled huge strides forward in the field of spatial archaeology research, such as spatial inferential statistics. These tools are particularly useful in the identification and location of clustering from statistical criteria, facilitating the subsequent analysis of accumulations through other archaeological, taphonomic and spatial techniques, such as fabric analysis or directional distribution. The cluster analysis, and its contextualisation considering all the archaeological and stratigraphical variables, allows the inference of some of the processes and factors that could have taken part in the accumulation of materials, as well as assessing how this affected the composition and preservation of the archaeological assemblage. The present article reviews the more traditional and innovative methods for studying horizontal distribution patterns and the objective definition of clusters, highlighting the parameters, uses and limitations of these techniques. We present an application of these methods to different Palaeolithic sites, going through different scenarios, such as location (open-air vs. cave), context, scale (large vs. small area), excavation methodology and spatial record methods.},

However, the theory of the Perfect Man and the institutions of spiritual Pole (quṭb) are not only crucial in taṣawwuf.

To talk about this central pillar of ʻirfānī (gnostic) wisdom without at least generally showing an understanding of it within the spirituality of duodecimal Shiism (al-iṯnā ʻashariyya), would be a gross negligence of the fundamental content of one of the two basic currents of Muslim "mysticism", even more so since Shiite critique of Ibn Arabī's teachings on quṭbiyyat and its supporters is the only viable and noteworthy one.},

 abstract = {Abstract Hunter‐gatherer architectural practices are one of the main sources of data to understand the complex land use of these societies. In the hyperarid Atacama Desert coast (Northern Chile), hunter‐gatherers‐fishers developed standardized stone‐built architecture during the Late Archaic period (∼5,700–4,000 cal years BP), interpreted so far as sedentary villages or long‐term campsites. Nevertheless, the lack of site formation process studies and systematic chronostratigraphies defy such functional interpretations. To address these issues, we reconstruct the lifecycle of a recently discovered semisubterranean structure at the Zapatero site (~25°S, Taltal). Combining stratigraphy, micromorphology, faunal and lithic analysis, as well as radiocarbon dating, we evidence a broad sequence involving different processes: shell midden formation; a stone‐structure; a prepared burial pit; a burning event; a short‐term occupational episode; and the entombment of the structure. We interpret this sequence as ritualized actions related to commemorative and place‐making activities. Our work stresses the need for new research programs at the Atacama Desert coast, based on geoarchaeological approaches, to understand hunter‐gatherer‐fisher middening and architectural practices from the very materiality involved in stratigraphy‐making processes.},

                    Background.
                    When analyzing the available literature, we found differences and considerable variability in the Special Judo Fitness Test (SJFT) reliability methods.
                  
                  
                    Problems and Aim.
                    For this reason, we have set our goal to determine the reliability and measurement error of all parameters by SJFT.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    The research sample consisted of 15 judo athletes (17.13 ± 1.96 years, body height 174.4 ± 10.64 cm, body weight 72 ± 15.37 kg) who trained in judo on average 8.73 ± 2.12 years in two different Slovak judo clubs. The results were processed using interclass correlation analysis and measurement error percentage.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    Our results indicate poor reliability for HR
                    0
                    (α= 0.374,
                    Err
                    = 4.2 %) and moderate reliability for the following parameters: the number of throws in section A (α = 0.641,
                    Err
                    = 5.9 %), section B (α = 0.512,
                    Err
                    = 6.0 %), and section C (α = 0.644,
                    Err
                    = 5.9 %), respectively. Moderate reliability was also found for the total number of throws (α = 0.687,
                    Err
                    = 5.1 %). Good reliability was found for HR

                    α = 0797,

                    = 3.5 %) and SJFT index
                    (
                    α = 0.807,
                    Err

                    Conclusions.
                    According to the results of this study, by testing the special level of judo fitness, as well as its changes, we recommend using the HR
                    1

With the support of high-throughput sequencing technology, there is accumulating evidence gradually clarifying that most of these factors are mainly through the interactions with gut microbiome to trigger downstream effects. The gut microbiome may be able to act as a very sensitive mirror in response to human daily diet.

 abstract = {The science of Ayurveda with its strong and unique fundamentals holds its domain forever amidst all scientific and medical advancements. The concept of Shadkriyakala (the different phases of disease formation) holds relevance in preventive medicine and public health management as it provides ample chance to halt the disease process at each stage by timely intervention. In this review, we would like to bring to the limelight the relevance of Ritucharya (seasonal regimen) in primary prevention by modulating the gut microbiota. The modern gut microbiome researches now help us to better explore the Ayurveda theories of Agni (digestive fire) and Ama (metabolic toxins) preached centuries back. Ayurveda firmly proclaims that no disease ever arises without the derangement of Agni (digestive fire). The whole preventive and treatment methodology in Ayurveda focuses upon the modulation and management of “Agni” (digestive fire). When the functioning of Agni is deranged, Ama (metabolic toxin) is produced and it vitiates the doshas which spread throughout the body and manifest as varied diseases. A biomedical perspective of our reviews suggests that dysbiosis of microbial flora can cause a leaky gut by which the toxins of deranged digestive metabolism enter the bloodstream. Consequently, an inflammatory response occurs within the body which expresses out as diseases opportunistically. We meticulously reviewed the influence of extrinsic factors namely diet and climate on human gut microbiota, and our analysis emphasises the application prospects of Ritucharya (seasonal regimen), in regulating the dynamic host-microbe interaction.},

 abstract = {In many regions of sub Saharan Africa large mammals occur in human-dominated areas, yet their community composition and abundance have rarely been described in areas occupied by traditional hunter-gatherers and pastoralists. Surveys of mammal populations in such areas provide important measures of biodiversity and provide ecological context for understanding hunting practices. Using a sampling grid centered on a Hadza hunter-gatherer camp and covering 36 km2 of semi-arid savannah in northern Tanzania, we assessed mammals using camera traps (n = 19 stations) for c. 5 months (2,182 trap nights). In the study area (Tli'ika in the Hadza language), we recorded 36 wild mammal species. Rarefaction curves suggest that sampling effort was sufficient to capture mammal species richness, yet some species known to occur at low densities in the wider area (e.g. African lions, wildebeest) were not detected. Relative abundance indices of wildlife species varied by c. three orders of magnitude, from a mean of 0.04 (African wild dog) to 20.34 capture events per 100 trap-nights (Kirk's dik dik). To contextualize the relative abundance of wildlife in the study area, we compared our study's data to comparable camera trap data collected in a fully protected area of northern Tanzania with similar rainfall (Lake Manyara National Park). Raw data and negative binomial regression analyses show that wild herbivores and wild carnivores were generally detected in the national park at higher rates than in the Hadza-occupied region. Livestock were notably absent from the national park, but were detected at high levels in Tli'ika, and cattle was the second most frequently detected species in the Hadza-used area. We discuss how these data inform current conservation efforts, studies of Hadza hunting, and models of hunter-gatherer foraging ecology and diet.},

Gut microbiome dysbiosis has been indicated to be associated with progression of these diseases. Analyses of gut/fecal microbiome in individual regions are important for our understanding of pathogenesis in HIV-1 infections. However, data on gut/fecal microbiome has not yet been accumulated in West Africa. In the present study, we examined fecal microbiome compositions in HIV-1 infected adults in Ghana, where approximately two-thirds of infected adults are females. In a cross-sectional case-control study, age- and gender-matched HIV-1 infected adults (HIV+; n = 55) and seronegative controls (HIV-; n = 55) were enrolled. Alpha diversity of fecal microbiome in HIV+ was significantly reduced compared to HIV- and associated with CD4 counts. HIV+ showed reduction in varieties of bacteria including <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, the most abundant in seronegative controls, but enrichment of <i>Proteobacteria</i>. Ghanaian HIV+ exhibited enrichment of <i>Dorea</i> and <i>Blautia</i>; bacteria groups whose depletion has been reported in HIV-1 infected individuals in several other cohorts. Furthermore, HIV+ in our cohort exhibited a depletion of <i>Prevotella</i>, a genus whose enrichment has recently been shown in men having sex with men (MSM) regardless of HIV-1 status. The present study revealed the characteristics of dysbiotic fecal microbiome in HIV-1 infected adults in Ghana, a representative of West African populations.},

It focuses on three majelis shalawat : Majelis Shalawat Kubro, Majelis Shalawat Muhammad, and Majelis Shalawat Adlimiyah. Employing field research, this article argues that the three shalawat groups that flourish in East Java have specific characters unique to the groups. They locate the silsilah (chain of lineage) as an important part in establishing the institution, doctrines, and Sufism practices among their adherents. The aspect of Sufism transmission is articulated as experiencing Sufism through living as inspired by Abu al-Qasim al-Junayd, not as told to them by ‘ulama who theorize Sufism. Furthermore, doing Sufism means a process of experiencing supported by two Sufism traditions at once; they are vivid interconnection ( ra bitat bi al-suhbah ) and virtual interconnection ( ra bitah bi al-ghayb ). The application of the two ra bitah s locates a Sufi travellers in a full consciousness ( yaqzah ) far from self-disappearance ( al-fana ’ fi al-shaykh ). With all of its characteristics, the three shalawat groups generate new variants of Sufi practice that can be considered as new Sufi order.},

 abstract = {Probably, one of the biggest questions about the Acheulean is focused on the functional aspects of its lithic industry and, more specifically, its link to subsistence activities developed by hominins during the Early Stone Age. Historically, tecno-functional research on ESA techno-complex has focused on the role played by flakes and LCT in the processing of animal carcasses, but less attention has been payed to other possible activities related with subsistence and tool making. Previous traceological studies on African Lower Paleolithic lithic industries have shown the complexity of activities made with the earliest lithic tools, including not only the processing of animal carcasses, but also activities dedicated to processing wood, non-woody plants and underground storage organs (USOs). In this paper we present the use-wear results obtained from the analysis of the Early Acheulean lithic tools with potentially functional edges which are part of the lithic assemblage from the Thiongo Korongo archaeological site (TK) (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania). The three main levels of the archaeological site, TKSF, TKLSC and TKLF, have been used as samples. From 466 lithic artefacts analyzed, 16 pieces present sufficient preservation of use related traces that are able to clearly identify the activities developed when compared with experimental reference collections. As a result, we have identified activities mainly related with the cutting and scraping of wood and non-woody plants, including USOs. In addition, some pieces have also presented traces indicating the processing of animal carcasses. These data provides important information about different activities developed in TK by early hominids, allowing us to make broader inferences about the different subsistence activities carried out during the Acheulean in Eastern Africa.},

 abstract = {<p><strong>Background:</strong> Long-term balancing selection (LTBS) can maintain allelic variation at a locus over millions of years and through speciation events. Variants shared between species, hereafter “trans-species polymorphisms” (TSPs), often result from LTBS due to host-pathogen interactions. For instance, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus contains TSPs present across primates. Several hundred candidate TSPs have been identified in humans and chimpanzees; however, because many are in non-coding regions of the genome, the functions and adaptive roles for most TSPs remain unknown. </p><p><strong>Results:</strong> We integrated diverse genomic annotations, with a focus on non-coding regions, to explore the functions of 125 previously identified regions containing multiple TSPs in humans and chimpanzees. We analyzed genome-wide functional assays, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We identify functional annotations for 119 TSP regions, including 71 with evidence of gene regulatory function from GTEx or genome-wide functional genomics data and 21 with evidence of trait association from GWAS and PheWAS. TSPs in humans associate with many immune system phenotypes, including response to pathogens, but we also find associations with a range of other phenotypes, including body mass, alcohol intake, urate levels, chronotype, and risk-taking behavior. </p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The diversity of traits associated with non-coding human TSPs further support previous hypotheses that functions beyond the immune system are subject to LTBS. Furthermore, several of these trait associations provide support and candidate genetic loci for previous hypothesis about behavioral diversity in great ape populations, such as the importance of variation in sleep cycles and risk sensitivity.</p>},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota has recently been associated with susceptibility/resistance to malaria in animal models and humans, yet the impact of the gut microbiota on the risk of a malaria attack remains to be assessed. This study aims at assessing the influence of the gut microbiota on malaria attacks and Plasmodium parasitæmia in children living in a malaria-endemic area in Mali. Three hundred healthy children were included in a 16-months cohort study in Bandiagara. Their gut bacteria and fungi community structures were characterised via 16S and ITS metabarcoding from stool samples collected at inclusion. Clinician team monitored the occurrence of malaria attacks. Asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium was assessed by qPCR. Over the 16-month period, 107 (36%) children experienced at least one occurrence of malaria attacks, and 82 (27%) at least one asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitæmia episode. A higher gut bacteria richness was independently associated with susceptibility to asymptomatic parasitæmia episodes and malaria attacks; while the Shannon H diversity and Chao-1 richness index of gut fungi community structure was relatively homogeneous in children who were and were not infected with P. falciparum. Using a linear discriminant effect size analysis of operational taxonomic units assigned to the species level, 17 bacteria, including Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Senegalimassilia sp., Atopobiaceae and Lachnosipraceae, and seven fungi, including Dioszegia fristigensis, Ogataea polymorpha and Cutaneotrichosporon cyanovorans, were associated with susceptibility; whereas eight bacteria, including, Bifidobacterium spp., Weissela confusa and Peptostreptococcacea, and 3 fungi, Malassezia sp., Niesslia exosporoides, and Didymocrea leucaenae, were associated with resistance to malaria. Moreover, 15 bacteria, including Coproccus eutactus, Terrisporobacter petrolearius, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ruminococcaceae, and 13 fungi, including Wallemia mellicola, were associated with susceptibility, whereas 19 bacteria, including Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcacea, and Lactobacillus ruminis, and three fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans, were associated with resistance to asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitæmia episodes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings that point the way towards strategies aiming to reduce the risk of malaria by modulating gut microbiota components in at-risk populations.},

 abstract = {The microbiome plays an important role in maintaining human health. Despite multiple factors being attributed to the shaping of the human microbiome, extrinsic factors such diet and use of medications including antibiotics appear to dominate. Mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gut, are highly adapted to be able to tolerate a large population of microorganisms whilst still being able to produce a rapid and effective immune response against infection. The intestinal microbiome is not functionally independent from the host mucosa and can, through presentation of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and generation of microbe-derived metabolites, fundamentally influence mucosal barrier integrity and modulate host immunity. In a healthy gut there is an abundance of beneficial bacteria that help to preserve intestinal homoeostasis, promote protective immune responses, and limit excessive inflammation. The importance of the microbiome is further highlighted during dysbiosis where a loss of this finely balanced microbial population can lead to mucosal barrier dysfunction, aberrant immune responses, and chronic inflammation that increases the risk of disease development. Improvements in our understanding of the microbiome are providing opportunities to harness members of a healthy microbiota to help reverse dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent disease progression.},

 abstract = {Summary  The diets of industrialized countries reflect the increasing use of processed foods, often with the introduction of novel food additives. Xanthan gum is a complex polysaccharide with unique rheological properties that have established its use as a widespread stabilizer and thickening agent 1 . However, little is known about its direct interaction with the gut microbiota, which plays a central role in digestion of other, chemically-distinct dietary fiber polysaccharides. Here, we show that the ability to digest xanthan gum is surprisingly common in industrialized human gut microbiomes and appears to be contingent on the activity of a single bacterium that is a member of an uncultured bacterial genus in the family Ruminococcaceae . We used a combination of enrichment culture, multi-omics, and recombinant enzyme studies to identify and characterize a complete pathway in this uncultured bacterium for the degradation of xanthan gum. Our data reveal that this keystone degrader cleaves the xanthan gum backbone with a novel glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) enzyme before processing the released oligosaccharides using additional enzymes. Surprisingly, some individuals harbor a Bacteroides species that is capable of consuming oligosaccharide products generated by the keystone Ruminococcaceae or a purified form of the GH5 enzyme. This Bacteroides symbiont is equipped with its own distinct enzymatic pathway to cross-feed on xanthan gum breakdown products, which still harbor the native linkage complexity in xanthan gum, but it cannot directly degrade the high molecular weight polymer. Thus, the introduction of a common food additive into the human diet in the past 50 years has promoted the establishment of a food chain involving at least two members of different phyla of gut bacteria. },

 abstract = {Humans typically consider altruism a moral good and condition their social behavior on the moral reputations of others. Indirect reciprocity explains how social norms and reputations support cooperation: individuals cooperate with others who are considered good. Indirect reciprocity works when an institution monitors and publicly broadcasts moral reputations. Here we develop a theory of adherence to public monitoring in societies where individuals are, at first, independently responsible for evaluating the reputations of their peers. Using a mathematical model, we show that adherence to an institution of moral assessment can evolve and promote cooperation under four different social norms, including norms that previous studies found to perform poorly. We determine how an institution’s size and its degree of tolerance towards anti-social behavior affect the rate of cooperation. Public monitoring serves to eliminate disagreements about reputations, which increases cooperation and payoffs, so that adherence evolves by social contagion and remains robust against displacement.},

 abstract = {Gastrointestinal symptoms in Crohn's disease (CD) are common and affect the quality of life of patients; consequently, a growing number of studies have been published on diet interventions in this group. The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including CD, has been widely discussed. Mainly, a decreased abundance of Firmicutes, species of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus, and the <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> species as well as a reduced general diversity have been described. In this review article, we summarize available data on the influence of reduction diets on the microbiome of patients with CD. One of the most frequently used elimination diets in CD patients is the low-FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet. Although many papers show it may reduce abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloating, it also reduces the intake of prebiotic substances, which can negatively affect the gut microbiota composition, decreasing the abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>. Other elimination diets used by IBD patients, such as lactose-free or gluten-free diets, have also been shown to disturb the microbial diversity. On the other hand, CDED (Crohn's disease exclusion diet) with partial enteral nutrition not only induces the remission of CD but also has a positive influence on the microbiota. The impact of diet interventions on the microbiota and, potentially, on the future course of the disease should be considered when nutritional guidelines for IBD patients are designed. Dietetic recommendations should be based not only on the regulation of the symptoms but also on the long-term development of the disease.},

 abstract = {Abstract When do aesthetic properties convey the concept of premiumness? Is symmetry tied to the perception of premiumness due to symmetry's evolutionary association to quality, an association not present with other aesthetic features like curvature? Usually, symmetry and curvature are preferred features. However, preference itself may not suffice to evoke premiumness. With this in mind, we predicted that symmetry (vs. asymmetry) and high(vs. low) product quality would both increase the perception of premiumness of a product while curvature (curved vs. angular) would only do so when it aligned with product quality. We conducted two preliminary exploratory experiments and four preregistered experiments in which we manipulated product quality, symmetry, and curvature of product packaging and measured preference and premiumness perception. We also conducted four additional experiments using a different product category to assess the generalizability of our results. We found that while both symmetry and curvature affect preference, only symmetry affects premiumness perception. Importantly, our results indicate that the extent to which aesthetic features convey brand premiumness can be product‐specific. We suggest a theoretical model on when visual aesthetic properties convey premiumness. Overall, our study informs how subtle aesthetic elements play a role in value perception, something which firms can capitalize on.},

In recent times, cooking has moved from the home kitchen to the factory with the diet of many people dominated by commercially prepared foods that are often high in fat and low in fiber content. Cooking has also introduced a variety of flavoring spices and herbs into our diet that have intrinsic anti-microbial properties. In this review, we will focus on a changing diet’s effects on the gut microbiota with particular emphasis on the availability of dietary fiber as a fermentable substrate for the gut microbiota. The connection between the amount of fiber in our diet and chronic inflammation has been long known. Is the link between low fiber intake and inflammation a direct effect resulting from eating more ‘inflammatory food’ or an indirect effect via a diet-induced unhealthy change in the microbiome? Understanding the explanation for food-related inflammation is critical to our ability to develop novel strategies to treat the modern epidemic of obesity and inflammatory diseases.},

Among the works that adopt the text of the Qur'an are the work entitled Qishashun-Nabiyyīn lil-Athfāl by Abi Al-Hasan Ali al-Hasan an-Nadwiy (2017) and the work Kalam-Qu: The stories in Al- The Qur'an by Jamal Qasim (2018). Both of these works are intended for children. This is the reason these two works are studied. The problem in this study is how the intertextual relationship between the two texts. Intertextual theory is used to study these problems. Thus, the aim of this study is to find and describe the intertextual relationship between the two works. The results of the research show that the transformation text follows the hypogram text. Apart from that, there are also differences between the stories contained in the two works. This happens because the author's or creator's purpose is to show his expertise in making works that are interesting and interesting to the readers.},

 abstract = {This article discusses the dynamic and changes in Islamic political history. Rather than focuses on the Islamic doctrine, it focuses on the characteristics of each historical period. Through historical approach, this study reveals that Islam and state-politics are two sides of a coin. Since the beginning of Islam, it has been intertwined with state politics. Nevertheless, the history of Islamic politics has many faces. There is no standard shape or entity of Islamic politics. Changes and variation are the result of the Islamic ummah’s efforts to develop political institutions that suit the demand of the era while trying to adhere to the Islamic teachings. This dynamic is seen in the changes from the era of the Prophet PBUH, the era of the four main Caliphs, up to the era of the large dynasties. In this modern era, the Islamic politics experiences a crisis due to the downfall of the old Islamic political entity (the caliphate) and the interaction with the modern west-political ideas. Various thoughts and political concepts tries to provide answers for the appropriate Islamic political shape/entity for this new era. However, currently a standard and ideal shape for an Islamic political entity is yet to be found.},

 abstract = {The human sleep pattern is paradoxical. Sleep is vital for optimal physical and cognitive performance, yet humans sleep the least of all primates. In addition, consolidated and continuous monophasic sleep is evidently advantageous, yet emerging comparative data sets from small-scale societies show that the phasing of the human pattern of sleep–wake activity is highly variable and characterized by significant nighttime activity. To reconcile these phenomena, the social sleep hypothesis proposes that extant traits of human sleep emerged because of social and technological niche construction. Specifically, sleep sites function as a type of social shelter by way of an extended structure of social groups that increases fitness. Short, high-quality, and flexibly timed sleep likely originated as a response to predation risks while sleeping terrestrially. This practice may have been a necessary preadaptation for migration out of Africa and for survival in ecological niches that penetrate latitudes with the greatest seasonal variation in light and temperature on the planet.},

 abstract = {Tool innovation has played a crucial role in human adaptation. Yet, this capacity seems to arise late in development. Before 8 years of age, many children struggle to solve the hook task, a common measure of tool innovation that requires modification of a straight pipe cleaner into a hook to extract a prize. Whether these findings are generalizable beyond postindustrialized Western children remains unclear. In many small-scale subsistence societies, children engage in daily tool use and modification, experiences that theoretically could enhance innovative capabilities. Although two previous studies found no differences in innovative ability between children from Western and small-scale subsistence societies, these did not account for the latter's inexperience with pipe cleaners. Thus, the current study investigated how familiarity with pipe cleaners affected hook task success in 132 Congolese BaYaka foragers (57 girls) and 59 Bondongo fisher-farmers (23 girls) aged 4-12 years. We contextualized these findings within children's interview responses and naturalistic observations of how pipe cleaners were incorporated into daily activities. Counter to our expectation, prior exposure did not improve children's performance during the hook task. Bondongo children innovated significantly more hooks than BaYaka children, possibly because they participate in hook-and-line fishing. Observations and interviews showed that children imagined and innovated novel uses for pipe cleaners outside the experimental context, including headbands, bracelets, and suspenders. We relate our findings to ongoing debates regarding systematic versus unsystematic tool innovation, the importance of prior experience for the ontogeny of tool innovation, and the external validity of experimental paradigms.},

 abstract = {The human gut microbiota harbors a heterogeneous and dynamic community of microorganisms that coexist with the host to exert a marked influence on human physiology and health. Throughout the lifespan, diet can shape the composition and diversity of the members of the gut microbiota by determining the microorganisms that will colonize, persist, or become extinct. This is no more pronounced than during early-life succession of the gut microbiome when food type and source changes relatively often and food preferences are established, which is largely determined by geographic location and the customs and cultural practices of that environment. These dietary selection pressures continue throughout life, as society has become increasingly mobile and as we consume new foods to which we have had no previous exposure. Dietary selection pressures also come in the form of overall reduction or excess such as with the growing problems of food insecurity (lack of food) as well as of dietary obesity (overconsumption). These are well-documented forms of dietary selection pressures that have profound impact on the gut microbiota that ultimately may contribute to or worsen disease. However, diets and dietary components can also be used to promote healthy microbial functions in the gut, which will require tailored approaches taking into account an individual's personal history and doing away with one-size-fits-all nutrition. Herein, we summarize current knowledge on major dietary selection pressures that influence gut microbiota structure and function across and within populations, and discuss both the potential of personalized dietary solutions to health and disease and the challenges of implementation.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental instability in archaeological samples can be detected through analysis of skeletal and dental remains. During life, disruptions to biological internal homeostasis that occur during growth and development redirect bodily resources to returning to homeostasis and away from normal processes such as symmetrical development. Because dental enamel does not remodel in life, any deviations from normal development are left behind. Even subtle disturbances to developmental trajectory may be detected in asymmetrical development of traits, specifically a random variation in sides termed fluctuating asymmetry. Human dental fluctuating asymmetry studies are common, but here we investigate the permanent dentition of a non-human primate <i>Papio anubis</i>, for potential fluctuating asymmetry relative to sex, weaning, and reproductive maturity. The sample stems from an outlier population that lives in the wettest and most humid habitat of any studied baboon group.
METHODS: The skulls of adult baboons were collected after their natural death in Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria. The permanent dentition of antimeric teeth (paired) were measured for maximum length and breadth using standard methods. The metrics were analyzed to assess the presence of fluctuating asymmetry in adult permanent mandibular and maxillary dentition. Measurement error and other forms of asymmetry (antisymmetry, directional asymmetry) were considered and dental measures expressing true fluctuating asymmetry were used to address three research questions.
RESULTS: Males exhibit greater fluctuating asymmetry than females, suggesting that males experience greater overall instability during the developmental period. While weaning is not more stressful than other life history stages for males and females (using the first molar fluctuating asymmetry index as a proxy compared to other teeth), it is more stressful for females than males. The onset of reproduction is also not more stressful than other life history stages for males and females (using the third molar fluctuating asymmetry index as a proxy compared to other teeth), but it is more stressful for males than females. We explore possible explanations for these findings in the discussion.},

Dengan metode kualitatif dan pendekatan deskriptif-analisis kritis dapat disimpulkan beberapa hal penting: Pertama, pernyataan Goldziher bahwa kodifikasi hadits baru dilakukan setelah beberapa abad wafatnya Nabi itu tidak benar, karena sudah ada beberapa sahabat yang mencatat hadits Nabi meskipun sedikit; Kedua , hadits hanyalah refleksi doktrinal dari perkembangan politik itu tidak tepat, karena tidak ditemukannya data yang otentik dari apa yang dipaparkan Goldziher; Ketiga , tuduhan pelarangan penulisan hadits itu keliru, karena faktanya Nabi hanya melarang jika hadits ditulis dalam satu tempat bersama ayat al-Qur’an untuk menghindari tumpang-tindihnya hadits dengan ayat al-Qur’an; Keempat , tudingan bahwa ahli hadits hanya berfokus pada kritik sanad itu salah, karena sejak dahulu terdapat dua tradisi kritik hadis yakni kritik sanad dan kritik matan yang keduanya tidak dapat dipisahkan dalam menentukan keshahihan hadis.},

 abstract = {Researchers studying social networks and inter-personal sentiments in bounded or small-scale communities face a trade-off between the use of roster-based and free-recall/name-generator-based survey tools. Roster-based methods scale poorly with sample size, and can more easily lead to respondent fatigue; however, they generally yield higher quality data that are less susceptible to recall bias and that require less post-processing. Name-generator-based methods, in contrast, scale well with sample size and are less likely to lead to respondent fatigue. However, they may be more sensitive to recall bias, and they entail a large amount of highly error-prone post-processing after data collection in order to link elicited names to unique identifiers. Here, we introduce an R package, DieTryin, that allows for roster-based dyadic data to be collected and entered as rapidly as name-generator-based data; DieTryin can be used to run network-structured economic games, as well as collect and process standard social network data and round-robin Likert-scale peer ratings. DieTryin automates photograph standardization, survey tool compilation, and data entry. We present a complete methodological workflow using DieTryin to teach end-users its full functionality.},

 abstract = {Archaeological sites often contain accumulations of remains derived from different independent events produced by different agents. Thus, in Palaeolithic sites, it is normal to find alternating occupations between humans and carnivores. The faunal assemblages at these sites usually include hundreds or thousands of bone fragments, which are very difficult to associate them to specific individuals since there are no currently available techniques able to do it in a straightforward and cost-effective way. In this work we present a methodology that allows us to characterise the anatomical remains of a bone accumulation and relate them all back to the specific individuals to which they belong. In order to provide a real world application, we have used a selection of animal bones from different individuals belonging to deer and sheep (fed in a controlled way using the same diet). On the other hand, fossilized faunal remains have also been analysed to verify if these fossilized bones keep some of the fingerprinting of the animal from which they come from. For this purpose, we have developed a protocol using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) together with Neural Networks (NN) implemented here to discriminate and reassemble deer and sheep bones from different individuals, which we subsequently applied for these proposes to fossilized material. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this technique has been applied for individual fingerprinting to actuality and fossil samples. The elemental composition of bones provides enough information to get a correct discrimination of different individuals. The spectral correlation has exceeded 95 %. and all individuals were correctly classified to the individual from which they come from. There have been no instances of false positives or false negatives in our tests or applications.},

This paper suggests that, to answer this question, we need to employ subtle theoretical considerations of theory choice—especially the consideration of the complexity-weighted differential predictive successes of the two accounts. To make this clearer, the paper develops a novel analysis of the observed differences in human sharing dispositions.},

 abstract = {Living 'things' coexist with microorganisms, known as the microbiota/microbiome that provides essential physiological functions to its host. Despite this reliance, the microbiome is malleable and can be altered by several factors including birth-mode, age, antibiotics, nutrition, and disease. In this minireview, we consider how other microbiomes and microbial communities impact the host microbiome and the host through the concept of microbiome collisions (initial exposures) and interactions. Interactions include changes in host microbiome composition and functionality and/or host responses. Understanding the impact of other microbiomes and microbial communities on the microbiome and host are important considering the decline in human microbiota diversity in the developed world - paralleled by the surge of non-communicable, inflammatory-based diseases. Thus, surrounding ourselves with rich and diverse beneficial microbiomes and microbial communities to collide and interact with should help to diminish the loss in microbial diversity and protect from certain diseases. In the same vein, our microbiomes not only influence our health but potentially the health of those close to us. We also consider strategies for enhanced host microbiome collisions and interactions through the surrounding environment that ensure increased microbiome diversity and functionality contributing to enhanced symbiotic return to the host in terms of health benefit.},

 abstract = {The ecology of the early environment - including microbial diversity, nutrition, nature, social interactions and the totality of exposures in the wider "exposome" - have life-long implications for all aspects of health and resilience. In particular, the emergence of "microbiome science" provides new evidence for vital relationships between biodiversity and health at every level. New perspectives of ecological interdependence connect personal and planetary health; the human health crisis cannot be separated from the social, political and economic "ecosystems" otherwise driving dysbiosis (from its etymological root, "life in distress") at every level. Adverse changes in macroscale ecology - of food systems, lifestyle behaviours, socioeconomic disadvantage and environmental degradation - all impact the microbial systems sitting at the foundations of all ecosystems. In particular, changes in the function and composition of the human-associated microbiome have been implicated in the mounting global burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), exacerbating inflammation and metabolic dysregulation through multiple pathways across the lifespan. This "dysbiotic drift" (adverse shifts in ecology at all scales) underscores the need for ecological approaches aimed at restoring symbiosis, balance and mutualism. While there is promise with supplement-based strategies (e.g. probiotics, prebiotics), it is essential to focus on upstream factors implicated in dysbiosis, including the health of wider environments, lifestyle, nature relatedness, and the social policies and practices which can facilitate or inhibit dysbiotic drift. This also calls for ambitious integrative approaches which not only define these interconnections, but also capitalize on them to create novel, collaborative and mutualistic solutions to our vast interdependent global challenges.},

The present work examines, both zooarchaeologically and taphonomically, the faunal remains of levels F and D of the Navalmaíllo Rock Shelter (Pinilla del Valle, Madrid, Spain) - the largest collection of such remains ever studied from the Iberian interior. The results allow this site to be interpreted as a Neanderthal hunting camp where occupations were short-term. Neanderthal people were the main agents that accumulated the site's faunal remains - largely those of large bovids and to a lesser extent medium-sized cervids. The activity of carnivores was also identified, but these animals mostly left behind the remains of small prey or fed upon carcasses abandoned at the camp by human hunters.},

 abstract = {This work analyze the technological management of raw materials and the mobility strategy of the human groups that occupied during the mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-3000 BP) the eastern Tandilia mountain range, and discuss them inside of settlement systems context for the southeastern Pampean region. The lithic study results of 13 occupations excavated in caves and rockshelters shows that mobility strategies in Tandilia mountain ranges were closer to collector models, where logistical groups moved into mountain range valleys in search of natural resources. We can recognize different strategies for raw material procurement: the immediately available rocks were obtained through direct access on daily foraging trips; the regional rocks were obtained through logistical displacements, residential movements and embedded strategies; and the access to the long distance rocks was through exchange between neighboring populations. Besides, during ca. 7000 to 5000 cal BP an increased use of immediately available raw materials and a high archaeological signal was detected. This scenario can be linked with an increased environmental aridity episode where human groups occupied with most intensity the Tandilia mountain valleys due to the greater availability of the water resources. Finally, this work provides new data suggesting that during this period in the southeastern Pampean region context, the hunter-gatherer groups combined forager and collector strategies to take advantage of the natural resources of the landscape with diverse environments (coastline, grassland plains, dunes field and mountain ranges).},

 abstract = {For most of our species' history, humans have lived in relatively small subsistence communities, often called small-scale societies. While these groups lack centralized institutions, they can and often do maintain large-scale cooperation. Here, we explore several mechanisms promoting cooperation in small-scale societies, including (a) the development of social norms that encourage prosocial behavior, (b) reciprocal exchange relationships, (c) reputation that facilitates high-cost cooperation, (d) relational wealth, and (e) risk buffering institutions. We illustrate these with ethnographic and psychological evidence from contemporary small-scale societies. We argue that these mechanisms for cooperation helped past and present small-scale communities adapt to diverse ecological and social niches.},

 abstract = {Host-probiotics of many fish species have not been applied due to the difficulty in isolation and functional verification, and some exogenous probiotics were confirmed to promote the growth performance of fish. Therefore, this study aims to screen the exogenous probiotics that can be used in the culture of Chinese perch and to explore their mechanism of action. Chinese perch were respectively fed with basal diet (CK) supplemented with Clostridium butyricum CB1 (C), Enterococcus faecalis EF1 (E), Bacillus subtilis BS1 (B), and Lactobacillus plantarum LP1 (L) at 1.0 × 108 CFU/g with equal amount for 8 weeks. After feeding, B group presented significantly higher abundance of Bacillus, Lactobacillus, and Paenibacillus, and L group displayed significantly higher abundance of Lactobacillus than CK group. Above increased probiotics species led to higher intestinal lipase activity in B group, intestinal protease activity in L group, and length of intestinal villi and thickness of intestinal wall in B and L groups through fermentation to reduce pH value and secretion of active substances, thus facilitating the nutrient absorption to improve the weight gain (WG). Additionally, B and L groups respectively exhibited higher abundance level of the infectious diseases-related pathway and lower abundance of Aeromonas, which was responsible for higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (p65-NF-κB, IL-Iβ, TNFα, and PAI) and higher blood immune parameter levels (globulin (GLB), total protein (TP), and lysozyme activity (LZM)), eventually improving survival rate. E group significantly inhibited microbial diversity and abundance of Energy metabolism pathway and Amino acid metabolism pathway, which might the reason for the decrease in crude protein content in whole-fish. C groups significantly reduced the microbial diversity and the length of intestinal villi to affect the host's nutrient absorption efficiency, thus causing a decrease in growth performance. Moreover, the imperfection of intestinal villi may allow more LPS to penetrate into the blood, thereby down-regulating the immune status and inducing inflammation, ultimately reducing survival rate. Above results indicated that Bacillus subtilis BS1 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP1 might be used in aquaculture, and probiotics may affect growth performance and gut health by regulating gut microbiota.},

 abstract = {Genetic data suggest that the Native American founder population diverged from its Asian parent population about 25,000 years ago and was geographically isolated during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 21,000 years BP) before dispersing into North and South America as the ice sheets retreated. Archaeological evidence in eastern Siberia and Beringia is scarce, however. Although stone tools and cutmarks on bones dated to the LGM are reported at Bluefish Caves (Yukon Territory, Canada), the stratigraphic integrity of the site and the interpretation of the bone modifications have long been questioned by the scientific community. Here, we describe the results of a zooarchaeological study of the faunal assemblages from Pleistocene loess deposits of Bluefish Caves 1 and 2. Taphonomic analyses indicate that humans hunted a variety of prey at the site, including the Beringian horse (E. lambei), as early as 23,500 years BP. We discuss the significance of the site in debates about the timing of the initial peopling of North America and the role of human-hunters in megafaunal extinctions.},

 abstract = {In this manuscript, we present the first systematic refitting results of the small-scale Middle Pleistocene (MIS11) rock shelter site of La Cansaladeta. The lithic materials that have been recovered from the archaeological levels E and J were the main study materials. These levels were investigated regarding spatial pattern analysis and analyzed with auxiliary methods such as quantitative density mapping demonstration and technological analysis of the lithic clusters. Thus, the spatial patterns of the two levels were compared and discussed, in terms of connections, clusters, and movement of the lithic elements. Undoubtedly, the well preservation of the archaeological levels offered a great opportunity for the interpretation of the spatial patterns in a high-resolution perspective. La Cansaladeta has not been paid attention adequately so far may be due to the small dimension of the excavation surface or to the scarcity of faunal record. Our results show that small-scale sites without long-distance refit/conjoin connections can provide significant spatial information. Indeed, if the sites have very well-preserved archaeological levels, the absence of long connections can be supported by the auxiliary methods.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota of chickens plays an important role in host physiology. However, the colonization and prevalence of gut microbiota have not been well-characterized. Here, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the duodenal, cecal and fecal microbiota of broilers at 1, 7, 21, and 35 days of age and characterized the dynamic succession of microbiota across the intestinal tract. Our results showed that Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum detected in each gut site at various ages, while the microbial diversity and composition varied among the duodenum, cecum, and feces at different ages. The microbial diversity and complexity of the cecal microbiota increased with age, gradually achieving stability at 21 days of age. As a specific genus in the cecum, <i>Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1</i> accounted for 83.50% of the total abundance at 1 day of age, but its relative abundance diminished with age. Regarding the feces, the highest alpha diversity was observed at 1 day of age, significantly separated from the alpha diversity of other ages. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the alpha diversity of duodenal samples among 7, 21, and 35 days of age. The predominant bacterium, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, was relatively low (0.68-6.04%) in the intestinal tract of 1-day-old chicks, whereas its abundance increased substantially at 7 days of age and was higher in the duodenum and feces. <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, another predominant bacterium in the chicken intestinal tract, was also found to be highly abundant in fecal samples, and the age-associated dynamic trend coincided with that of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. In addition, several genera, including <i>Blautia, Ruminiclostridium_5, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014</i>, and <i>[Ruminococcus]_torques_group</i>, which are related to the production of short-chain fatty acids, were identified as biomarker bacteria of the cecum after 21 days of age. These findings shed direct light on the temporal and spatial dynamics of intestinal microbiota and provide new opportunities for the improvement of poultry health and production.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance (AR) is indisputably a major health threat which has drawn much attention in recent years. In particular, the gut microbiome has been shown to act as a pool of AR genes, potentially available to be transferred to opportunistic pathogens. Herein, we investigated for the first time changes in the human gut resistome during aging, up to extreme longevity, by analyzing shotgun metagenomics data of fecal samples from a geographically defined cohort of 62 urban individuals, stratified into four age groups: young adults, elderly, centenarians, and semisupercentenarians, i.e., individuals aged up to 109 years. According to our findings, some AR genes are similarly represented in all subjects regardless of age, potentially forming part of the core resistome. Interestingly, aging was found to be associated with a higher burden of some AR genes, including especially proteobacterial genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps. Our results warn of possible health implications and pave the way for further investigations aimed at containing AR accumulation, with the ultimate goal of promoting healthy aging. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antibiotic resistance is widespread among different ecosystems, and in humans it plays a key role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota, enhancing the ecological fitness of certain bacterial populations when exposed to antibiotics. A considerable component of the definition of healthy aging and longevity is associated with the structure of the gut microbiota, and, in this regard, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is critical to many pathologies that come about with aging. However, the structure of the resistome has not yet been sufficiently elucidated. Here, we show distinct antibiotic resistance assets and specific microbial consortia characterizing the human gut resistome through aging.},

 abstract = {Eubiotic lignocellulose is a new and useful dietary fiber source for chickens. However, few studies have been undertaken on the impacts of its use as a supplement in different chicken breeds. In this experiment, 108 Chinese native breed Bian hens (BH) and 108 commercial breed ISA Brown hens (IBH) were chosen. They were randomly divided into three groups, and 0, 2, or 4% eubiotic lignocellulose was added to their feed during the growing periods (9-20 weeks), respectively. We aimed to observe the impacts of adding eubiotic lignocellulose on the growth and laying performance, gut microbiota, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of two breeds of hens. In this study, the addition of eubiotic lignocellulose had no significant effect on the growth performance and gut microbial diversity in the two breeds of chickens (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, adding 4% eubiotic lignocellulose significantly increased the cecum weight, laying performance (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), but had no significant effect on the SCFA of BH (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05); however, adding 4% significantly inhibited the intestinal development, laying performance, butyrate concentration, and SCFA content of IBH (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the relative abundances of the fiber-degrading bacteria <i>Alloprevotella</i> and butyrate-producing bacteria <i>Fusobacterium</i> in the 4% group of BH were significantly higher than those in the 4% group of IBH (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), resulting in the concentration of butyrate was significantly higher than those in it (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Combining these results suggests that the tolerance of BH to a high level of eubiotic lignocellulose is greater than that of IBH and adding 2-4% eubiotic lignocellulose is appropriate for BH, while 0-2% eubiotic lignocellulose is appropriate for IBH.},

Variations in their odorant receptor protein sequence and structure resulted in variation in detection and perception. Studying thirty olfactory receptor genes, we found our relatives showed highly conserved receptor structures, but Homo sapiens did not. Variants led to changes in sensitivity to some odors, but no change in specificity, indicating a common olfactory repertoire in our genus. Diversity of geographic adaptations in H. sapiens may have produced greater functional variation in our lineage, increasing our olfactory repertoire and expanding our adaptive capacity.

 abstract = {Over the course of human evolution, shifts in dietary practices such as meat-eating and cooking, have resulted in reduced fiber intake, a trend that has been exaggerated more recently in industrialized populations. Reduced fiber consumption is associated with a loss of gut microbial taxa that degrade fiber, particularly butyrate. Therefore, this dietary shift in humans may have altered the abundance of microbial genes involved in butyrate production. This study uses a gene-targeted alignment approach to quantify the abundance of butyrate production pathway genes from published wild nonhuman primate and human gut metagenomes. Surprisingly, humans have higher diversity and relative abundances of butyrate production pathways compared with all groups of nonhuman primates except cercopithecoids. Industrialized populations of humans also differ only slightly in butyrate pathway abundance from nonindustrialized populations. This apparent resilience of butyrate production pathways to shifts in human diet across both evolutionary and modern populations may signal an evolutionary shift in host-microbe interactions in humans that increased SCFA production. Such a shift could have contributed to meeting the increased energy requirements of humans relative to nonhuman primates.},

However, limited exploration of the rodent gut microbiome beyond the model species Mus musculus has made it difficult to interpret microbiome variation in a broader phylogenetic context. Here, we analyse 120 de novo and 469 public metagenomically-sequenced faecal and caecal samples from 16 rodent hosts representing wild, laboratory and captive lifestyles. Distinct gut bacterial communities were observed between rodent host genera, with broadly distributed species originating from the as-yet-uncultured bacterial genera UBA9475 and UBA2821 in the families Oscillospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae, respectively. In laboratory mice, Helicobacteraceae were generally depleted relative to wild mice and specific Muribaculaceae populations were enriched in different laboratory facilities, suggesting facility-specific outgrowths of this historically dominant rodent gut family. Several bacterial families of clinical interest, including Akkermansiaceae, Streptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, were inferred to have gained over half of their representative species in mice within the laboratory environment, being undetected in most wild rodents and suggesting an association between laboratory domestication and pathobiont emergence.},

 abstract = {Reputation is a fundamental feature of human sociality as it sustains cooperative relationships among unrelated individuals. Research from various disciplines provides insights on how individuals form impressions of others, condition their behaviours based on the reputation of their interacting partners and spread or learn such reputations. However, past research has often neglected the socio-ecological conditions that can shape reputation systems and their effect on cooperation. Here, we outline how social environments, cultural values and institutions come to play a crucial role in how people navigate reputation systems. Moreover, we illustrate how these socio-ecological dimensions affect the interdependence underlying social interactions (e.g. potential recipients of reputational benefits, degree of dependence) and the extent to which reputation systems promote cooperation. To do so, we review the interdisciplinary literature that illustrates how reputation systems are shaped by the variation of prominent ecological features. Finally, we discuss the implications of a socio-ecological approach to the study of reputation and outline potential avenues for future research.

 abstract = {Microorganisms live in environments that inevitably fluctuate between mild and harsh conditions. As harsh conditions may cause extinctions, the rate at which fluctuations occur can shape microbial communities and their diversity, but we still lack an intuition on how. Here, we build a mathematical model describing two microbial species living in an environment where substrate supplies randomly switch between abundant and scarce. We then vary the rate of switching as well as different properties of the interacting species, and measure the probability of the weaker species driving the stronger one extinct. We find that this probability increases with the strength of demographic noise under harsh conditions and peaks at either low, high, or intermediate switching rates depending on both species' ability to withstand the harsh environment. This complex relationship shows why finding patterns between environmental fluctuations and diversity has historically been difficult. In parameter ranges where the fittest species was most likely to be excluded, however, the beta diversity in larger communities also peaked. In sum, how environmental fluctuations affect interactions between a few species pairs predicts their effect on the beta diversity of the whole community.},

 abstract = {Beehive products have a rich global history. In the wider Levantine region, bees had a significant role in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and intensive beekeeping was noted in Israel during the Biblical period when apiaries were first identified. This study investigates the origins of this extensive beekeeping through organic residue analysis of pottery from prehistoric sites in the southern Levant. The results suggest that beehive products from likely wild bees were used during the Chalcolithic period as a vessel surface treatment and/or as part of the diet. These functions are reinforced by comparison to the wider archaeological record. While the true frequency of beeswax use may be debated, alternatives to beehive products were seemingly preferred as wild resources contrasted with the socio-economic system centred on domesticated resources, controlled production and standardization. Bee products only became an important part of the economic canon in the southern Levant several millennia later.},

 abstract = {Why do humans develop beliefs in supernatural entities that punish uncooperative behaviors? Leading hypotheses maintain that these beliefs are widespread because they facilitate cooperation, allowing their groups to outcompete others in intergroup competition. Focusing on within-group interactions, we present a model in which people strategically endorse supernatural punishment beliefs as intuitive tools of social control to manipulate others into cooperating. Others accept these beliefs, meanwhile, because they are made compelling by various cognitive biases: they appear to provide information about why misfortune occurs; they appeal to intuitions about immanent justice; they contain threatening information; and they allow believers to signal their trustworthiness. Explaining supernatural beliefs requires considering both motivations to invest in their endorsement and the reasons others adopt them.},

 abstract = {The search for life/health quality has driven the search for a better understanding of food components on the overall individual health, which turns to be intrinsically related to the digestive system. In vitro digestion models are considered an alternative for the in vivo studies for a variety of practical reasons, but further research is still needed concerning the colon model establishment. An effective in vitro colon model should consider all unit operations and transport phenomena, together with chemical and biochemical reactions, material handling and reactor design. Due to the different techniques and dependence on the donor microbiota, it is difficult to obtain a standard protocol with results reproductible in time and space. Furthermore, the colon model should be fed with a representative substrate, thus what happens in upper digestion tract and absorption prior to colon is also of crucial importance. Essentially, there are two ways to think about how to achieve a good and useful in vitro colon model: a complex biomimetic system that provides results comparable with the in vivo studies or a simple system, that despite the fact it could not give physiologically relevant data, it is sufficient to understand the fate of some specific components.},

 abstract = {In the wide field of archaeology, stone tools are one of the major pieces of evidence to assess the knowledge and understanding of the peopling of the Americas. To answer anthropological questions concerning migration routes, colonization events, and further socio-cultural developments in the Americas, long term research has been directed to deepening the knowledge and understanding diverse technological topics of terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene lithic remains, with particular focus on “fishtail”, “Fell’s cave”, or just “Fell” projectile points. Resulting from the research advances, this paper provides further detailed information to enlarge the database and morpho-technological knowledge of Fell points from north of the La Plata River, in the southern cone of South America. The analyzed sample has shown that there is broad technical and dimensional variability. Based on specific technological features and well-dated coeval finds, with some caution I consider the hypothesis that in certain places, the Fell points makers might have developed a regional variant with barbs or highly acute shoulders. The new observations have significant implications for understanding one of the earliest bifacial technologies in the archaeology of the Americas.},

The bone record presented was retrieved from excavations made in hunting blinds, sites with a remarkable frequency in the region. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, since bone conservation represents a major problem for the archaeological studies of the plateau, to the objective is to distinguish, from a taphonomic perspective, the existence of more and less conservative sectors of bone evidence within the area. Second, the subsistence strategies adopted in the plateau during the Late Holocene will be assessed in order to discuss the presence of faunal management variability. The results indicate that although the plateau occupation exhibits a marked logistic and/or seasonal character, the adopted strategies are characterized by the development of multiple alternatives and different modalities in relation to the use of faunal resources.},

It is a penecontemporaneous record that was formed around 3050-3210 BP which is remarkable due to the high frequency of guanaco bones (Lama guanicoe) and, to a lesser extent, of cauquén remains (Chloephaga sp.). Additionally, a high frequency of bone pounders and chalcedony scrapers was recorded. We propose that this site was a campsite originated by an attritionally discard behavior within a short time frame, in which whole preys (guanacos) were taken for processing, consumption, and subsequent transport of their axial skeleton. The fact that cauquén remains were found suggests that human occupations took place, at least, during spring and summer. Due to these features, Laguna Las Vegas stands out as a valuable site, one which adds useful information about faunal resource management and mobility of the hunter-gatherer populations of the Coyle River middle basin.},

                      The gut microbiome performs many important functions in mammalian hosts, with community composition shaping its functional role. However, what factors drive individual microbiota variation in wild animals and to what extent these are predictable or idiosyncratic across populations remains poorly understood.
                    
                    
                      
                        Here, we use a multi-population dataset from a common rodent species (the wood mouse,
                        Apodemus sylvaticus
                        ), to test whether a consistent set of ‘core’ gut microbes is identifiable in this species, and to what extent the predictors of microbiota variation are consistent across populations.
                      
                    
                    
                      Between 2014 and 2018 we used capture-mark-recapture and 16S rRNA profiling to intensively monitor two wild UK mouse populations and their gut microbiota, as well as characterising the microbiota from a laboratory-housed colony of the same species.
                    
                    
                      Although broadly similar at high taxonomic levels and despite being only 50km apart, the two wild populations did not share a single bacterial amplicon sequence variant (ASV). Meanwhile, the laboratory-housed colony shared many ASVs with one of the wild populations from which it is thought to have been founded decades ago. Despite strong taxonomic divergence in the microbiota, the factors predicting compositional variation in each wild population were remarkably similar. We identified a strong and consistent pattern of seasonal microbiota restructuring that occurred at both sites, in all years, and within individual mice. While the microbiota was highly individualised, seasonal convergence in the gut microbiota among individuals occurred in late winter/early spring.
                    
                    
                      These findings reveal highly repeatable seasonal gut microbiota dynamics across distinct populations of this species, despite divergent taxa being involved. Providing a platform for future work to understand the drivers and functional implications of such predictable seasonal microbiome restructuring, including whether it might provide the host with adaptive seasonal phenotypic plasticity.

Based on the faunal analysis of several assemblages from sites dated to the Jericho IX/Lodian (7800–7500 Bp) and Wadi Raba cultures (7500–6500 Bp), located in diverse geographic zones, it expands upon the current knowledge regarding the status of livestock exploitation and the extent of hunting. We expected some measure of exploitation of secondary products, as previous studies show that intense use of livestock for milk had already emerged in several places in Europe and the Near East by the 8th millennium BC. Our examination of the species abundance, herd demography, and changes in body size of the main livestock animals and wild species in multiple sites showed that livestock were utilized mainly for meat, and not for their secondary products. Additionally, while the animal economy in all sites relied on a combination of livestock and wild species, the extent of reliance on each source varied greatly between sites, especially in the Late Pottery Neolithic. Finally, our findings demonstrate that the economy of the Late Pottery Neolithic (Wadi Raba) of the southern Levant is more similar to the Early Pottery Neolithic (Jericho IX/Lodian) than to the later Chalcolithic Ghassulian.},

 abstract = {Summary
                
                  Metabolism of dietary compounds by the gut microbiota generates a vast array of microbiome-dependent metabolites (MDMs), which are highly variable between individuals. The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG),
                  p
                  -cresol sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDMs generation; however, it is unclear if interindividual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. Notably, the coefficient of variation in three uMDMs of interest, PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome), did not significantly decrease. The majority of circulating MDMs maintained variation despite identical diets. These results highlight the highly personalized profile of MDMs and limited contribution of short-term dietary heterogeneity, suggesting that dietary modification may need to be paired with microbial therapies to control MDM profiles.

 abstract = {Summary  Developing methods to modulate growth of the mucin-degrading gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila could benefit patients with different health needs, as A. muciniphila has been associated with both positive metabolic health outcomes and detrimental neurodegenerative outcomes. Growth of A. muciniphila is sensitive to plant-derived polyphenols, and particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs), when administered in isolated form at supraphysiological doses. However, it remains unclear whether doses sufficient for these effects are achievable via diet. Here, we explore the extent to which nutritionally relevant doses of common polyphenol-rich foods – berries, wine, and coffee – influence A. muciniphila abundance in C57BL/6J mice under varying dietary conditions. By administering polyphenol-rich whole foods, comparing polyphenol-depleted and PAC-rich versus PAC-poor food supplements, and through gradient PAC-dosing experiments, we show that PAC-rich foods uniquely induce A. muciniphila growth at doses that are feasibly achieved through routine diet. Notably, the effects of PAC supplementation were detected against a high-fat diet but not a low-fat control diet background, highlighting the importance of habitual diet strategies in either amplifying or mitigating the prebiotic effects of PAC-rich food consumption. Ultimately, our work suggests that both PACs and diet influence A. muciniphila abundance with downstream impacts for human health. },

 abstract = {Abstract    We can reconstruct aspects of our shared history as Homo sapiens from the bones of ancestors who have lived and died over the past 200 000 years, from the archaeological traces they left behind, and from DNA. Fossil, archaeological and genetic evidence agree in showing that all living humans trace back their ancestry to Africa. Around 100 000 years ago, anatomically modern humans dispersed from there, eventually giving rise to all non‐African populations. The timing, the consequences and many details of the evolutionary processes accompanying such dispersion are still under investigation but can be inferred from patterns of genomic variation among individuals and populations, and from the study of ancient DNA. This way, we have been able to reconstruct aspects of human evolution and prehistory in a previously unconceivable detail. Open questions include the extent and consequences of Homo sapiens interactions with archaic human forms, the routes followed by the populations expanding out of Africa, and the often complex relationships between modern ethnic identities and genetic ancestry.    Key Concepts    Populations of anatomically modern human originated in Africa, probably not in a single place and not necessarily at the same time   Despite human populations being much larger, the overall human genetic diversity is the lowest in all primates, and these small differences are mainly accounted for by individual differences within populations   Variation has been observed at more than 20% of nucleotide sites in our 3.3 billion nucleotide‐pairs genome, but a typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4.1–5.0 million sites, that is less than 0.2% of the total genome length   In a typical genome, there are 2100–2500 structural variants, affecting another 0.8% of its total length   African genomes harbour more diversity than those from any other continent, and a large share of the genetic diversity in these continents is represented by subsets of African alleles.   Patterns of genetic resemblance in humans are far more complicated than any scheme of racial classification can account   The Neandertal contribution to non‐African genomes is currently estimated between 1.5 and 2.1%, whereas Denisovan ancestry seems largely limited to Melanesian and Oceanian populations (4–6%)   Research is in progress to establish whether models of single or multiple dispersals from Africa better account for current genome diversity    },

 abstract = {Obtaining and transporting material for manufacturing flaked stone tools comes at a cost. Numerous studies evaluate how processing may reduce transport costs, often using models of optimal foraging theory such as central place foraging and field processing. However, to date these studies do not adequately address the continued reuse of toolstone through space and time, or the repeated use of toolstone by multiple individuals. To remedy this, we offer a novel theoretical framework for the conveyance of lithic material derived from the logic of the marginal value theorem. This framework explains changes in lithic acquisition, use, and discard in terms of changing environmental context. Specifically, this study examines the effect of distance from a geological source of lithic material on access to anthropogenic sources of lithic material, including previously discarded tools and cores, and quantifies these spatial patterns in terms of optimal processing before discard. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of past and current modeling approaches, and test predictions developed using the marginal value theorem through an artifact inventory and analysis of archaeological sites in the lower Dolores River canyon lands in southeastern Utah. The results of this case study support model predictions, showing that the degree of processing and use intensity represented in lithic assemblages increase in response to the decreasing quality and abundance of available lithic material that occurs with increased distance from the geological source.

Methods focus on study of hard tissues – dental eruption, joint fusion, and brain size – that preserve as fossils; it is then possible to assess fossil species relative to both Pan and H. sapiens. Advances in the study of development in fossils are enhanced through microhistological analyses that utilize dental enamel secretion lines to provide an age-at-death of immature individuals. Fossils from several sites in eastern and southern Africa that date as far back as 3 million years show that species of australopiths and Homo erectus mature dental, cranial and postcranial systems similarly to wild chimpanzees.

 abstract = {In a paper published on scientific American, February 2017, proposed that physical exercising does no help to energy expenditure so is useless to losing obesity. However, this is unbelievable and rebels the fact that exercising consume energy; furthermore, those who keep exercising and are good at sports are always very healthy with good figure, and their abilities to learn are remarkably higher than those who don’t exercise, such as Bruce Lee and many athletes on Olympics. It is a puzzle how the result in this paper was got. Read the paper carefully, noticing that the comparison is between the European people who think more and the Hadza people who only live on hunting and gathering, a relatively primary stage of the society, Hadza people have physical exercising while hunting but they don’t think therein, they just try every place out to find the poisoned giraffe without thinking where had it gone, without any theory or certainty. The way how Hadza people live is mechanical, like the sheep who only eat, drink and reproduce the next generation who live in same way as their ancestors, they don’t think to pursue what they like and to live better; therefore, it is their cutting down their thinking and learning that made their same expenditure as Europeans who don’t exercising, not their physical exercising itself doesn’t increase their energy expenditure. Using more nutriology, exercising exactly helps to losing obesity and it has better effect thereto as combined with learning, learning consumes the blood glucose first which is advantageous to fat burning in physical exercising. Learning and exercising make oneself be better so that he lives better thereby, physical exercising also has many other beneficial effects to human’s health and cleverness etc., it is a perfect way for man to lose obesity and keep healthy to combine proper physical exercising with more thinking and learning. One should learn as well as exercise to lose obesity and keep healthy, so that one could have a healthy figure as well as be better and live better thereby.},

 abstract = {While most animals play, only humans play games. As animal play serves to teach offspring important life-skills in a safe scenario, human games might, in similar ways, teach important culturally relevant skills. Humans in all cultures play games; however, it is not clear whether variation in the characteristics of games across cultural groups is related to group-level attributes. Here we investigate specifically whether the cooperativeness of games covaries with socio-ecological differences across cultural groups. We hypothesize that cultural groups that engage in frequent inter-group conflict, cooperative sustenance acquisition, or that have less stratified social structures, might more frequently play cooperative games as compared to groups that do not share these characteristics. To test these hypotheses, we gathered data from the ethnographic record on 25 ethnolinguistic groups in the Austronesian language family. We show that cultural groups with higher levels of inter-group conflict and cooperative land-based hunting play cooperative games more frequently than other groups. Additionally, cultural groups with higher levels of intra-group conflict play competitive games more frequently than other groups. These findings indicate that games are not randomly distributed among cultures, but rather relate to the socio-ecological settings of the cultural groups that practice them. We argue that games serve as training grounds for group-specific norms and values and thereby have an important function in enculturation during childhood. Moreover, games might server an important role in the maintenance of cultural diversity.},

Many people perish on perilous treks around the world in search of a better life. However, there is not much being done to track down these people. DNA profiling has made it possible to track these migrants with its advanced techniques and established protocols. DNA profiling is still a gold standard technology for human identification. In the last three decades, genetic research has become increasingly applicable in the study of human history. Several advancements in our knowledge of human migration have been made possible by developments in the sequencing and study of both current and ancient peoples’ genomes. They have helped to prove that anatomically modern humans initially arose in Africa around 250,000–350,000 years ago and then spread to other provinces of the world, and the humans’ genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions are among them. Analyses of this original genetic data are transforming our understanding of humans’ migration history and adaption. We may now collect whole-genome sequences from a variety of existing and prehistoric Africans using today’s sequencing technologies. In the coming years, significant discoveries will be made in the study of human migration.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evolutionary-grounded sleep research has been critical to establishing the mutual dependence of breastfeeding and nighttime sleep proximity for mothers and infants. Evolutionary perspectives on cosleeping also often emphasize the emotional motivations for and potential benefits of sleep proximity, including for parent-infant bonding. However, this potential link between infant sleep location and bonding remains understudied for both mothers and fathers. Moreover, in Euro-American contexts bedsharing has been linked to family stress and difficult child temperament, primarily via maternal reports. We know relatively little about whether paternal psychosocial dynamics differ based on family sleep arrangements, despite fathers and other kin often being present in the cosleeping environment across cultures. Here, we aim to help address some of these gaps in knowledge pertaining to fathers and family sleep arrangements.
METHODOLOGY: Drawing on a sample of Midwestern U.S. fathers (N=195), we collected sociodemographic and survey data to analyze links between infant nighttime sleep location, paternal psychosocial well-being, father-infant bonding, and infant temperament. From fathers' reports, families were characterized as routinely solitary sleeping, bedsharing, or roomsharing (without bedsharing).
RESULTS: We found that routinely roomsharing or bedsharing fathers, respectively, reported stronger bonding than solitary sleepers. Bedsharing fathers also reported that their infants had more negative temperaments and also tended to report greater parenting-related stress due to difficulties with their children.
CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional results help to highlight how a practice with deep phylogenetic and evolutionary history, such as cosleeping, can be variably expressed within communities with the potential for family-dependent benefits or strains.},

 abstract = {Microbes perform a variety of vital functions that are essential for healthy ecosystems, ranging from nutrient recycling, antibiotic production and waste decomposition. In many animals, microbes become an integral part by establishing diverse communities collectively termed as "microbiome/s". Microbiomes defend their hosts against pathogens and provide essential nutrients necessary for their growth and reproduction. The microbiome is a polygenic trait that is dependent on host genotype and environmental variables. However, the alteration of microbiomes by stressful condition and their recovery is still poorly understood. Despite rapid growth in host-associated microbiome studies, very little is known about how they can shape ecological processes. Here, we review current knowledge on the microbiome of Daphnia, its role in fitness, alteration by different stressors, and the ecological and evolutionary aspects of host microbiome interactions. We further discuss how variation in Daphnia physiology, life history traits, and microbiome interactive responses to biotic and abiotic factors could impact patterns of microbial diversity in the total environment, which drives ecosystem function in many freshwater environments. Our literature review provides evidence that microbiome is essential for Daphnia growth, reproduction and tolerance against stressors. Though the core and flexible microbiome of Daphnia is still debatable, it is clear that the Daphnia microbiome is highly dependent on interactions among host genotype, diet and the environment. Different environmental factors alter the microbiome composition and diversity of Daphnia and reduce their fitness. These interactions could have important implications in shaping microbial patterns and their recycling as Daphnia are keystone species in freshwater ecosystem. This review provides a framework for studying these complex relationships to gain a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary roles of the microbiome.},

It has been linked to the beginning of stone tool use, to physiological changes leading to crucial anatomical transformations defining our genus, and to new socioreproductive and cognitive behaviors. Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6 million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore guilds.},

 abstract = {Evidence of the consumption of meat through hunting or scavenging by Early Pleistocene hominins is scarce, particularly in South Africa. Moreover, the interpretations of taphonomic evidence are subject to an important discussion commonly called the 'hunting-vs-scavenging debate.' Until today, only the Swartkrans Members 1-3 site has yielded a butchered bone assemblage large enough to permit reconstruction of carcass acquisition strategies by Early Pleistocene hominins in South Africa. This leaves an information gap between 1.4 and 1.0 Ma. Here, we provide the first evidence of meat consumption by hominins during this gap, based on the zooarchaeological study of the large mammal bone assemblage recovered from the Cooper's D site, South Africa. Based on skeletal part representation, our results show density-mediated attrition of bovid bones due to predepositional and postdepositional destruction. We argue that this attrition is the result of both abiotic (i.e., decalcification) and biotic (i.e., carnivore ravaging) processes. Bovid mortality profiles point out the involvement of ambush predators such as large felids. Bone surface modifications also indicate that the assemblage has been accumulated mostly by carnivores but with some hominin involvement as well. We observe all the stages of animal carcass processing (skinning, disarticulation, defleshing, marrow extraction) as well as the exploitation of a diversity of prey size classes at both Swartkrans Members 1-3 and Cooper's D. Thus, our study shows the importance of the Cooper's D bone assemblage for understanding Early Pleistocene hominin subsistence behaviors. Moreover, this article highlights the need for including long bone flake specimens in the analysis of large bone assemblages from South African caves to better understand the Early Pleistocene hominin bone damage record.},

Se han identificado restos faunsticos correspondientes a los camlidos Lama guanicoe, Hemiauchenia paradoxa y Lama gracilis. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar los patrones de consumo de los camlidos, dado que son los taxones que se hallan ms representados en el conjunto analizado.

Abstract: This paper aims to study a bone assemblage deposited in the Cueva Tnel site, located in the Central Plateau of Santa Cruz, Argentina. The site covers a temporal range that dates from late Pleistocene to Late Holocene. We focus on its lower component, dating back to ca. 10500 years BP, which presents a wide diversity of fauna, including several extinct species. Faunal remains have been found that correspond to three camelids species: Lama guanicoe, Hemiauchenia paradoxa and Lama gracilis. The objective of this paper, then, is to analyze the consumption patterns of camelids, as they are the most represented taxa in the analyzed assemblage. This situation is repeated in other sites corresponding to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in southern Patagonia, indicating the economic importance that camelids have had throughout the initial Patagonia colonization process. However, the strategies employed in the processing and consumption of these taxa, and the inter-taxonomic differences in the exploitation of these resources have not been investigated in detail. To achieve this, we consider the following variables: taxonomic assignment, frequency of skeletal parts, evidence of taphonomic agents and the study of human processing and consumption marks. These data are contextualized with information about the ecological environment, in order to present a characterization of the subsistence and mobility patterns of the first human groups that populated the interior sectors of southern Patagonia.},

 abstract = {Location is crucial in the life of an animal; in this chapter we cover the mechanisms used by animals to find food, shelter, mates, and the right microclimate. Animals may find good habitat by moving randomly, but more often movements are oriented to external stimuli. After determining the location of a stimulus, an animal moves toward that stimulus if it is attractive, or away from it if it is repulsive. Compass orientation gives animals the ability to move at an angle with respect to the location of the sun, moon, stars, or the earth’s magnetic field; homing and migration typically depend on compass orientation. In addition, path integration is important to many animals. When using path integration, an animal calculates an efficient route to its nest or den based on its outward journey. Migration allows animals to find seasonally appropriate habitats but requires complex navigation that can span thousands of kilometers.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet patterns are a significant and modifiable contributing factor to the composition of the human gut microbiota.
OBJECTIVES: We set out to identify reproducible relationships between diet and gut microbial community composition in a diverse, healthy US adult cohort.
METHODS: We collected 2 to 3 automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recalls over 10-14 days, together with a single stool sample, from 343 healthy adults in a cross-sectional phenotyping study. This study examined a multi-ethnic cohort balanced for age (18-65 years), sex, and BMI (18.5-45 kg/m2). Dietary data were edited to a tree format according to published methods. The tree structure was annotated with the average total grams of dry weight, fat, protein, carbohydrate, or fiber from each food item reported. The alpha and beta diversity measurements, calculated using the tree structure, were analyzed relative to the microbial community diversity, determined by a Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 2 analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region, sequenced from stool samples. K-means clustering was used to form groups of individuals consuming similar diets, and gut microbial communities were compared among groups using differential expression analysis for sequence count data.
RESULTS: The alpha diversity of diet dry weight was significantly correlated with the gut microbial community alpha diversity (r = 0.171). The correlation improved when diet was characterized using grams of carbohydrates (r = 0.186) or fiber (r = 0.213). Bifidobacterium was enriched with diets containing higher levels of total carbohydrate from cooked grains. Lachnospira, was enriched with diet patterns containing high consumption of fiber from fruits excluding berries.
CONCLUSIONS: The tree structure, annotated with grams of carbohydrate, is a robust analysis method for comparing self-reported diet to the gut microbial community composition. This method identified consumption of fiber from fruit robustly associated with an abundance of pectinolytic bacterial genus, Lachnospira, in the guts of healthy adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02367287.},

 abstract = {New occurrences of early artefacts ascribed to the Oldowan tradition come from localities at high level within the caldera of the extinct Kilombe volcano, located in the central rift valley of Kenya. The trachyte cone and caldera of Kilombe volcano formed at ca. 2.5 Ma, and the record of >130m of sediment-fill indicates that the caldera subsequently held a lake for long periods during the Early Pleistocene. The Oldowan artefact localities, dated by 40Ar/39Ar and palaeomagnetism to ∼1.78 Ma, lie east of the centre of the caldera, on the west side of an ancient small lake, which later drained away as a gorge formed on the east side of the mountain. The artefacts are dominantly made of Kilombe trachyte, and are associated with a fauna of large animals including Hippopotamus gorgops. These are the first Oldowan localities to be discovered in a new area of the Kenyan rift valley in the last thirty years, and their presence at high level in rugged landscape indicates that the associated hominins were exploiting a full range of environments.},

 abstract = {The shift to increased meat consumption is one of the major adaptive changes in hominin dietary evolution. Although meat eating by Oldowan hominins is well evidenced at Pleistocene archaeological sites in eastern Africa by butchery marks on bones, the methods through which carcasses were acquired (i.e., hunting vs. scavenging) and extent of their completeness (fleshed vs. defleshed) is less certain. This study addresses these issues through a geographic information systems (GIS) comparative analysis of bone modification patterns created by hominins and carnivores observed in the ca. 2.0 Ma assemblage from Kanjera South, Kenya and those of several modern, experimentally modified bone assemblages. Comparison of GIS-generated models shows that the pattern of bone preservation at Kanjera South is similar to that found in experimental bone assemblages that were first butchered and hammerstone fractured by humans, and subsequently scavenged by carnivores. The distribution of bone modifications on the Kanjera fauna also suggests hominins had early access to small bovids. Butchery marks appear almost exclusively in ‘hot zones’—areas where flesh does not typically survive lion consumption—further suggesting Kanjera hominins were not scavenging carnivore kills. Our findings support previous claims that the Kanjera assemblage offers the earliest clear evidence of repeated butchery of antelope carcasses by Early Stone Age (Oldowan) hominins and perhaps the earliest evidence for hunting. Kanjera carnivore damage frequencies are lower than those reported for the slightly younger site of FLK Zinj (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), suggesting differing competitive regimes at the two sites.},

 abstract = {The remarkable mutualism between humans and greater honeyguides (Indicator indicator) is known still to thrive in only a few places in Africa. Here, we report on the honey-hunting culture of the marginalised Awer people in Kenya, historically a hunter-gatherer culture who today practise a mixed economy including significant amounts of foraging for wild foods. As part of a larger effort to document cross-cultural honey-hunting traditions in Africa, we interviewed six Awer honey-hunters to document their cultural practices. The interviewees reported that they depend on wild honey as a source of income, and that they readily seek the cooperation of honeyguides. Honey-hunting skills and the calls/whistles used to communicate with honeyguides are learnt from their fathers and other elders in village. The best time to honey-hunt is in the months following the big rains (August–December), when interviewees go out honey-hunting once a week on average. Honeyguides are not actively rewarded with wax, as it is believed that once a bird is fed it will not cooperate again for some time, and therefore after the honey harvest is complete, all remaining wax comb is buried. Honey-hunting practices are declining in this region, which interviewees attributed to drought and a lack of interest by the youth. These findings expand our understanding of how human-honeyguide mutualism persists across a range of human cultural variation.},

When there is condition like imbalance in human natural microflora, mostly in the gut results in ill conditions known as dysbiosis. Recent advance study on the human gut suggests that misbalance of microbial flora may result in predisposition to different disease phenotypes. The use of probiotics as mediators in health and diseases has been raised in recent years. The human gut has the ability to act as home to over 100–1000 species of microbes, where the internal environment is modulated, which plays an important role in host health. In this chapter, we have tried to explain some of the applications of probiotics on the human as well as animal gut and how they are beneficial. Points such as probiotics and its current value in the market, gut microbiota and its effect on the immune system, and several diseases are explained. Information related to microorganisms and their role is encoded.},

Second, each lecturer's primary type of TT interaction element. Third, the utilization of code-switching as a component of bilingual learning interactions. This research was a case study of three Arabic lecturers (T1, T2, and T3) who used Google Meets to conduct online learning. Each lecturer was videotaped three times and then examined using Miles and Huberman's qualitative approach. The findings of the L2 investigation demonstrate that 1) T1 produced twelve different types of interaction features. Furthermore, T2 produced eleven different types of interaction features. Finally, T3 produced twelve different types of interaction features. 2) The most dominant TT interaction features in the classrooms by T1 was Scaffolding (18.2 percent), T2 was Display Questions (24.6 percent), and T3 was Confirmation Check (23.1 percent). 3) In the context of bilingual classes, this study also found that L2 lecturers used other interaction features to facilitate interaction, namely code-switching from Arabic (L2) to Indonesian (L1) and vice versa. The total occurrence of code-switching by T1 was 9.1 percent (the least), code-switching by T2 was 27.3 percent, and code-switching by T3 was 63.6 percent (the most dominant). Code-switching can be an excellent alternate approach or interaction tool for facilitating communication in the classroom when learning Arabic; nevertheless, it must be used appropriately and proportionally.},

 abstract = {ObjectiveA suite of adaptations facilitating endurance running (ER) evolved within the hominin lineage. This may have improved our ability to reach scavenging sites before competitors, or to hunt prey over long distances. Running economy (RE) is a key determinant of endurance running performance, and depends largely on the magnitude of force required to support body mass. However, numerous environmental factors influence body mass, thereby significantly affecting RE. This study tested the hypothesis that alternative metabolic strategies may have emerged to enable ER in individuals with larger body mass and poor RE.MethodsA cohort of male (n = 25) and female (n = 19) ultra-endurance runners completed submaximal and exhaustive treadmill protocols to determine RE, and V̇O2Max.ResultsBody mass was positively associated with sub-maximal oxygen consumption at both LT1 (male r=0.66, p<0.001; female LT1 r=0.23, p=0.177) and LT2 (male r=0.59, p=0.001; female r=0.23, p=0.183) and also with V̇O2Max (male r=0.60, p=0.001; female r=0.41, p=0.046). Additionally, sub-maximal oxygen consumption varied positively with V̇O2Max in both male (LT1 r=0.54, p=0.003; LT2 r=0.77, p<0.001) and female athletes (LT1 r=0.88, p<0.001; LT2 r=0.92, p<0.001).ConclusionsThe results suggest that, while individuals with low mass and good RE can glide economically as they run, larger individuals can compensate for the negative effects their mass has on RE by increasing their capacity to consume oxygen. The elevated energy expenditure of this low-economy high-energy turnover approach to ER may bring costs associated with energy diversion away from other physiological processes, however.},

 abstract = {East Africa is characterised by extreme social and environmental contrasts that has undergone transformative changes over the past 300,000 years - the era of modern humans. People have left increasingly deep and pervasive footprints across the region, resulting in the anthropogenically crafted landscape of the present. The book shows how understanding contemporary issues, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, conservation, agricultural development, and achieving the sustainable development agenda, all require an appreciation of the past. The volume explore these interactions from the origins of human species with a particular focus on the last 500 years the Anthropocene. As trade, particularly of ivory, maize, and munitions, expanded with the Asia, Europe and the Americas this shaped many of the current issues in East Africa’s society, economy, and environment. These trade links paved the way for the colonial era that started at an atypical moment in East African environmental history. The colonial impacts on society, ecosystems, Protected Areas, biodiversity conservation, and the ensuing legacy through the independent states of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are explored. Given this rich, diverse, and connected past, what the future will be like for East African societies, ecosystems, and landscapes under climate change, high population growth, and rapid development? Rob Marchant is Professor of Tropical of Ecology at the University of York, UK. Much of his research is focused on East Africa, where over the past thirty years of working in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania he has developed close collaborations with the numerous University, NGO, UN and Governmental institutions that, alongside multiple conversations with individuals, have profoundly influenced and shaped the perspectives presented here. The interplay between the climate, ecosystems, cultures, livelihoods, and land uses are explore to document how the massive challengesfacing the region have been created, are being addressed and future opportunities maximized.},

The research method is descriptive qualitative which the data and studies are based on various sources, which are then analyzed using a semiotic approach and Riffaterre's theory by looking at the indirectness of expressions, models, variants, matrices, and hypograms based on the previous reading heuristically and hermeneutically. The results analysis is described and presented in the words form. The subject of the research is the poem Īkbarῑ Īsyrῑna 'Āman, while the object of research is the meaning or matrix in the poem Īkbarῑ Īsyrῑna 'Āman. This researcher based the analysis on Riffaterre's semiotic reading, which revealed that the holistic meaning of this poem is about a man who loves a girl who is still young and has different age from him. This research shows a strong sense of love in Nizar so that he can compose poetry in a very beautiful way. The meaning is obtained based on hermeneutic reading, which is strengthened by the "falling in love" model, which has 3 variants, namely: waiting, time and age, and meeting. The matrix of this poem is "the expectation and belief of a man that he can gain his love with the young girl in the twenty years later". This poem consisted of hypogram text that related to another Nizar’s poem, Uchibbuka.},

 abstract = {The archaeopaleontological site of Dmanisi in Georgia, dated to ∼1.8 Ma, provides evidence on the first hominin dispersal out of Africa, while the sites of Barranco León and Fuente Nueva-3 in Spain, dated to ∼1.4 Ma, record the earliest hominin settlements in Europe. However, a number of issues related to the dispersal route, the climatic conditions and the ecological scenario of this dispersal event are subject to debate. In a recent paper in L’anthropologie, Agustí and Lordkipanidze (2019) proposed an alternative scenario for the arrival of hominins in the Caucasus, which they conceived as a forest refugium area during the Early Pleistocene, and discarded that their dispersal coincided with that of other members of the Ethiopian and Asian faunas, like the sabertooth Megantereon whitei or the giant hyena Pachycrocuta brevirostris. Our review of these issues suggests that: (i) the elongated sabers and reduced postcanine teeth of African M. whitei limited the ability of this predator to process the prey carcass, which resulted in scavengeable resources for the Dmanisi hominins; (ii) the mass estimate in excess of 100kg obtained for the trochlear perimeter of the distal humerus of the hyena from Dmanisi shows that it can be confidently ascribed to the genus Pachycrocuta; (iii) the postcranial anatomy of the Dmanisi hominins was not advantageous for scavenging tree-stored prey; (iv) the laterally flattened upper canines of M. whitei could not withstand the loads that would result from climbing a prey carcass into a tree; (v) paleobotanical analyses suggest a temperate grassland ecosystem in Dmanisi, not dominant forest conditions, with enhanced aridity in the level of hominin occupation; (vi) similarly, the low frequency of arboreal pollen in the Levantine Corridor at ∼1.8 Ma points to more arid conditions than today in this area; (vii) many archaeopaleontological sites of the Rift Valley and its extension towards the Red Sea, the Levant and the Caucasus show evidence of tectonic, volcanic and/or hydrothermal events; and (viii) the delay of 400 ka in the arrival of hominins in Western Europe did not result from a lower availability of scavengeable resources.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Background The gut microbiome is a crucial element that facilitates a host’s adaptation to a changing environment. Host-specificity often coincides with distinctions in gut microbes, suggesting a co-evolution of the holobionts. However, it is unclear how gut microbiota shared by a common host ancestor would co-diversify with hosts and eventually become distinct among sister hosts. In this context, understanding the evolutionary pathway of gut microbiomes of the same host species could provide insight on how holobionts co-adapt along environmental gradients. Specifically, we ask which factor, nature or nurture, i.e., genetics or diets, contributes more to the shaping of gut microbiome, along with host diversification and range expansion.   Results  We compared and analyzed the gut microbiomes of 99 Asian honeybees, Apis cerana, from genetically diverged populations covering 13 provinces across China. Bacterial composition varied significantly across populations at phylotype, sequence-discrete population (SDP), and strain levels, but with extensive overlaps, indicating the diversity of microbial community among A. cerana populations is driven by nestedness. Taken together, genetics exhibited tangential impacts, while pollen diets were significantly correlated with both the composition and function of gut microbiome. Core bacteria, Gilliamella and Lactobacillus Firm-5, showed antagonistic turnovers and contributed to the enrichment in carbohydrate transport and metabolism. By feeding and inoculation bioassays, we confirmed that the variations in pollen polysaccharide composition contributed to the trade-off of these core bacteria.    Conclusions Progressive change, i.e., nestedness, is the foundation of gut microbiome evolution in the Asian honeybee. Such a transition during the co-diversification of gut microbiomes is shaped primarily by environmental factors, diets in general, pollen polysaccharide in particular. },

Unlike cows, there have been limited studies linking body linear traits with male reproductive ability and semen cryo-preservability of breeding bulls. Present study reported the age-related changes in body linear type traits in Frieswal (N = 378) dairy bulls and its relevance with reproductive potentials of breeding bulls. Our results indicated that body frame size traits were significantly and positively correlated with gonadal linear traits. Among the selected body mophometric parameters body length, chest girth and head circumference were the important body linear type traits having capability to discriminate between bulls of frozen semen doses (FSD) and non-FSD categories. Discriminant function has been developed based on body linear traits of crossbred dairy bulls to find out males of superior reproductive potentials. Our finding provided evidence that body length (humerous tuberosity to tuber ischii) was the most powerful linear body trait associated with breeding bulls' reproductive ability and semen quality.},

 abstract = {The submerged site of Ohalo II was occupied during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 23,500-22,500 cal BP, bridging the Upper Paleolithic/Epipaleolithic transition in the southern Levant. The site is known for the excellent preservation of its brush huts and botanical remains. This study examines the behavior of its past inhabitants through analysis of the entire faunal assemblage found on the three successive floors of Brush Hut 1. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to test differing models of prey choice and assess whether the observed resource diversification is the result of resource depression (explained by Optimal Foraging Theory) or resource abundance (explained by Niche Construction Theory). We focused on a quantitative, qualitative and spatial investigation of the more than 20,000 faunal remains, combining traditional zooarchaeological methods with microwear analysis of teeth and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of burnt bones. Identification of faunal remains to the most detailed level possible, combined with analysis of skeletal element frequencies allowed reconstruction of a profile of the desired prey, highlighting the importance of small, expedient prey compared to larger game (ungulates). FTIR was used to identify degrees of burning and to develop a key to identifying burnt bones from water-logged environments. Availability of multiple food sources within a rich habitat may have driven exploitation of those varied local resources, rather than targeting energetically-rich large prey. The choice of a littoral habitat that could be intensively exploited is an example of niche selection. Comparison with contemporaneous and later sites contributes to the ongoing discussion about Early Epipaleolithic prey choice, and the impact, if any, of the LGM in the Jordan Valley. Ohalo II is an example of diverse prey choice motivated by abundance rather than stress, at a 23,000-year-old fisher-hunter-gatherers camp.},

 abstract = {We propose a predator-prey model to explain diachronic changes in Palaeolithic diet breadth. The fraction of rapidly-reproducing hard-to-catch hares and birds among small animals in the hominin diet shows a significant increase between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in the Levant, with an associated decrease in slowly-reproducing easily-caught tortoises. Our model interprets this fraction in terms of foraging effort allocated to, and foraging efficiency for each of these two classes of resource, in addition to their abundances. We focus on evolutionary adjustments in the allocation of foraging effort. The convergence stable strategy (CSS) of foraging effort and the dietary fraction of hares/birds are both highly sensitive to variation in the foraging efficiencies, which may have been upgraded by advanced technology introduced from Africa or developed locally. A positive correlation (not necessarily a cause and effect relationship) is observed between this fraction and forager population when the foraging efficiency for hares/birds is varied. Overexploitation can however result in a reduction of both diet breadth and forager population, as can food sharing within the forager group. Food sharing is routine among recent (and perhaps also Palaeolithic) foragers. We speculate that some controversial issues regarding this public goods problem might be resolved if we could incorporate sexual selection into our model.},

@article{pub.1145263781,
 abstract = {The Federmesser culture in Denmark in light of an amateur archaeologist’s flint collectionIn 2010, the dedicated amateur archaeologist Ingvor Filtenborg passed away. For more than 30 years he had systematically walked the fields near his home just to the east of Store Andst near Kolding, Southern Jutland. As this area lies on the current administrative boundary between the museums in Kolding and Sønderskov, his collection became divided. This meant that the culture-historical significance of some aspects of this material has not previously been fully appreciated. This article presents and describes flint tools from his collection that are diagnostic of the so-called Federmesser culture (arch- or curved-backed point groups) dating to the Allerød warm phase of the Late Glacial (12000-11000 years BC). This was a time during which Southern Scandinavia saw dramatic changes in the composition of the local fauna and flora (fig. 2). The diagnostic flint tools from this techno-complex are slender arch-backed points, small flake-scrapers and blade-scrapers with invasive lateral retouch, often forming a tang (so-called Wehlen scrapers). Sites of the Federmesser culture are rare in Denmark and their relationship to the older Hamburgian culture and, in particular, the slightly later Bromme culture remains uncertain.There are methodological challenges associated with surface-collected flint, which clearly limit the analytical potential of such material. The Filtenborg collection is no exception in this regard. However, recent research conducted in other parts of Northern Europe is drawn upon here in order to argue for the likely coherence of the Late Glacial elements in the Filtenborg collection. Importantly, the tools usually seen as diagnostic of the Bromme culture – the large tanged ‘Bromme’ or ‘Lyngby’ points – are found together with the above-mentioned arch-back points in Ing­vor Filtenborg’s collection. However, rather than seeing the material as being derived from repeated occupation episodes by people of two separate cultures (the Federmesser culture and Bromme culture, respectively), It is argued that the finds presented here form a single assemblage, and that the inventory actually fits neatly into the artefact spectrum known from many other sites of the Federmesser culture. On the basis of radiocarbon dates and the topographic position of these localities, an attempt is made to place them in their culture-historical and landscape contexts.Material from eight separately recorded localities is presented (site numbers HBV 185, HBV 187, HBV 189, HBV 191, MKH 411, MKH 1111, MKH 1124, and MKH 1116). These cluster around the hilly area to the north of Lake Dollerup and stretch towards the now largely drained wetlands by the village of Gamst (fig. 1). It is likely that material from the immediately adjacent localities HBV 185 and 189, as well as material from HBV 191, MKH 411, MKH 1111, and MKH 1116, should be seen as belonging to only two rather than six different sites. The assemblages contain classic components of the Federmesser culture flint repertoire such as arch-backed points, large tanged points, small thumbnail scrapers and tanged Wehlen scrapers as well as simple scrapers on blades and flakes (Table 1 and figs. 3-6). Furthermore, previous work conducted near the village of Gamst also produced Late Glacial flints, including large tanged and arch-backed points, as well as scrapers (fig. 7).Widening the geographic perspective, this particular combination of tool types also occurs at many localities of the Federmesser culture outside Denmark. The majority of the sites at which the slender arch-backed points occur together with the bulkier large tanged points extend along the periphery of Late Glacial human settle­ment, from England in the west to Poland and possibly as far as Lithuania, the Ukraine and Belarus in the east (Table 2). It is likely that such a co-occurrence reflects the parallel use of two distinct hunting weapons, the bow and arrow (tipped with arch-backed points) and the dart and spear thrower (tipped with large tanged points). Interestingly, a small but steadily increasing number of these localities has been dated by radiometric methods (see Table 3). Calibration of these dates, together with the dates available for the Bromme culture, shows that the Federmesser culture precedes the Bromme culture in Southern Scandinavia, and that the transition from Federmesser culture to Bromme culture happened some time around 10900 cal BC (fig. 8). What remains unclear is why and how this transition happened and why arch-backed points together with a range of other characteristic tools, seemingly disappeared from the toolkit of the Bromme culture.As Ingvor Filtenborg labelled most of his collection and produced maps of where particular parts of it came from, it was also possible to investigate the position of the localities presented here within their local and regional landscape context. Several other Late Glacial localities are known from the area around Lake Dollerup, such as Hjarup Mose to the south and Estrup Mose and Gamst immediately to the east, and all these sites have yielded very similar flint assemblages. The densest find concentration, however, is found around the lakes near Jels, about 15 km to the south of Lake Dollerup. There too, arch-backed points occur together with large tanged points. Taking an off-site and landscape-focused perspective, these localities can be interpreted as having been part of a diffuse and taphonomically filtered form of settlement hierarchy. Within this, sites such as Jels with relatively high find densities, represent the upper ranks, while the localities around Lake Dollerup represent lower levels of settlement activity (fig. 9). Interestingly, it appears that at Lake Dollerup and elsewhere during the Allerød particular landscape types were preferentially targeted for settlement: undulating terrain with dry, sandy soils in the vicinity of, but rarely directly by, bodies of freshwater. Past decision making about where to rest and settle in the Allerød, it is argued, was contingent on the combined presence of these attributes as well as, perhaps, on a settlement legacy created by previous visits. Late Glacial settlement was thus channelled by particular landscape configurations such as the undulating and topographically complex terrain of the Jutland Ridge. The Late Glacial flint scatters around Lake Dollerup likely constituted ‘significant localities’ repeatedly visited by small groups of pioneering hunter-gatherers. In addition, they were also part of a ‘significant landscape’ stretching from Northern Germany to Lake Dollerup, and beyond to the north and east. Ethnographic observations suggest that such significant landscapes were imbued not only with economic significance, but that they also became integral parts of the social fabric through stories, legends and named topographic features.Over 30 years of fastidious field recognisance by the late Ingvor Filtenborg has produced an interesting collection of Late Glacial flint material, including tools of the elusive Federmesser culture. These flints derive from more or less disturbed surface scatters, but nonetheless hold some analytical value, at least within an off-site context. The co-occurrence of arch-backed points usually associated with the Federmesser culture and large tanged points usually associated with the Bromme culture throws into sharp relief the fact that such typological automatism has so far prevented us from recognising the culture-historical importance of this kind of locality: The presence of large tanged points together with arch-backed points appears to assign such inventories to the earlier part of the Allerød warm phase. If large tanged points are accepted as an integral part of the flint inventory of the Federmesser culture, then many of the single finds of such tools from around Denmark may say more about the settlement patterns of the that techno-complex, rather than the Bromme culture, with which they are usually linked. Other collectors, archaeologists and museums are therefore urged to come forth with similar flint material, so that the actual extent and nature of Federmesser culture occupation in Denmark can be investigated in more detail. Felix RiedeAfdeling for Forhistorisk ArkæologiAarhus UniversitetSteffen Terp LaursenMoesgård MuseumEjvind HertzSkanderborg Museum},

 abstract = {Cognitive biases like underinference, the hard-easy effect, and recurrently non-monotonic confidence are evolutionarily puzzling when viewed as persistent flaws in how people learn from environmental feedback. To explain these empirically robust cognitive biases from an evolutionary perspective, we propose a model of ancestral human learning based on the cultural-evolutionary-theoretic hypothesis that the primary selection pressure acting on ancestral human cognition pertained not to learning individually from environmental feedback, but to socially learning task-specific knowledge. In our model-which is inspired by classical Bayesian models-an ancestral human learner (the student) attempts to learn task-specific knowledge from a role model, with the option of switching between different tasks and role models. Suppose that the student's method of learning from their role model is a priori uncertain-in that it can either be successful imitation learning or de facto innovation learning-and the ecological fitness costs of meaningfully retaining environmental feedback are high. Then, the student's fitness-maximizing strategy does not retain their environmental feedback and-depending on the choice of model parameters-can be characterized by all of the aforementioned cognitive biases. Specifically, in order for the evolutionarily optimal estimate of confidence in this learning environment to be recurrently non-monotonic, it is necessary (as long as the environment's marginal payoff function satisfies a plausible quantitative condition) that a positive proportion of ancestral humans' attempted imitation learning was unknowingly implemented as de facto innovation learning. Moreover, an ecologically rational strategy of selective social learning can plausibly cause the evolutionarily optimal estimate of confidence to be recurrently non-monotonic in the empirically documented way: general increase with an intermediate period of decrease.},

 abstract = {Associative Tool Use (ATU) describes the use of two or more tools in combination, with the literature further differentiating between Tool set use, Tool composite use, Sequential tool use and Secondary tool use. Research investigating the cognitive processes underlying ATU has shown that some primate and bird species spontaneously invent Tool set and Sequential tool use. Yet studies with humans are sparse. Whether children are also able to spontaneously invent ATU behaviours and at what age this ability emerges is poorly understood. We addressed this gap in the literature with two experiments involving preschoolers (E1, <i>N</i> = 66, 3 years 6 months to 4 years 9 months; E2, <i>N</i> = 119, 3 years 0 months to 6 years 10 months) who were administered novel tasks measuring Tool set, Metatool and Sequential tool use. Participants needed to solve the tasks individually, without the opportunity for social learning (except for enhancement effects). Children from 3 years of age spontaneously invented all of the types of investigated ATU behaviours. Success rates were low, suggesting that individual invention of ATU in novel tasks is still challenging for preschoolers. We discuss how future studies can use and expand our tasks to deepen our understanding of tool use and problem-solving in humans and non-human animals.},

 abstract = {The origins and significance of an aquatic diet in hominin evolution is a scientific research topic of high significance. Some have argued that marine shellfish collection was a key ingredient in the emergence of modern human behavioral and cultural complexity. The collection of marine resources, which can be productive and predictable, may have evolved into a coastal adaptation that led to reduction in residential mobility and other important changes in behavior and culture. Therefore, studying the emergence and intensity of coastal occupations is important to understand the rise of this particular aspect of modern humans' behavioral and cultural evolution. In this article, we use an agent-based model to explore the interaction between foraging behavior and the environment, and the impact of such interaction on sites' length of occupation, which in turn affects the accumulation of artifacts and ecofacts. The results of the model suggest that the intensive occupation of coastal sites is likely to be influenced by their position within a restricted band of productive coastal habitat. Even when foragers spend most of their time in other habitats, the cyclical reoccupation of coastal sites – due to the coast's cyclical productivity as well as the low number of locations that can be occupied there – could naturally result in higher artifact density in coastal than inland sites. Here, we argue that, given those results, coastal locations should accumulate large and dense deposits of occupation debris. These will be obvious features on the landscape and should be easier to find than inland occupations because of the coastal habitats' confined space. Finally, given the higher find densities of those sites, this may lead archaeologists to overestimate the contribution of marine resources in prehistoric diets. Therefore, what archaeologists have interpreted as intensive coastal adaptation in the past may be more the result of geographical constraints rather than important evolutionary changes.},

 abstract = {Cultural evolution depends on both innovation (the creation of new cultural variants by accident or design) and high-fidelity transmission (which preserves our accumulated knowledge and allows the storage of normative conventions). What is required is an overarching theory encompassing both dimensions, specifying the psychological motivations and mechanisms involved. The bifocal stance theory (BST) of cultural evolution proposes that the co-existence of innovative change and stable tradition results from our ability to adopt different motivational stances flexibly during social learning and transmission. We argue that the ways in which instrumental and ritual stances are adopted in cultural transmission influence the nature and degree of copying fidelity and thus also patterns of cultural spread and stability at a population level over time. BST creates a unifying framework for interpreting the findings of otherwise seemingly disparate areas of enquiry, including social learning, cumulative culture, overimitation, and ritual performance. We discuss the implications of BST for competing by-product accounts which assume that faithful copying is merely a side-effect of instrumental learning and action parsing. We also set out a novel "cultural action framework" bringing to light aspects of social learning that have been relatively neglected by behavioural ecologists and evolutionary psychologists and establishing a roadmap for future research on this topic. The BST framework sheds new light on the cognitive underpinnings of cumulative cultural change, selection, and spread within an encompassing evolutionary framework.},

 abstract = {In the East African region, Tanzania represents a nucleus of early human origin. Central Tanzania in particular abounds in prehistoric and historical human and cultural evidences. Archaeologically, Dodoma Region (35°–37° E and 4°–7° S) in Central Tanzania is a centre of attraction for rock art and early human settlements. Apart from earlier discoveries of some of the potential archaeological sites, new scholarly investigations including our surveys in and around the Dodoma Region have yielded substantial evidence to strengthen the dense nature of habitat, congenial environment, subsistence and survival of early humans. Some of the archaeological sites such as Isimila, the late Acheulian/Early Stone Age site, Kondoa, Singida and Bahi rock art sites (Culwick AT, J R Anthropol Inst Great Brit Irel. 61:443–453, 1931) of early Holocene times; and Stone Age and historical sites around the University of Dodoma are a few instances of evidence in the Dodoma Region revealing temporary, semi-sedentary and sedentary settlements located in different habitats and environments. Our research activities, which include reconnaissance survey, intrusive excavation and geospatial investigations, have uncovered several topographical and geomorphic features of archaeological sites in the region. Geomorphological features as shown by the stratigraphic profiles of test excavations in various archaeological and cultural heritage sites, location aspects, physiographic and environmental conditions and variations derived from non-intrusive geospatial technological applications such as aerial photos, satellite imagery and GPS coordinates substantively corroborate the idea of subsistence and adaptation to survival of early human populations within the existing ecological conditions. The data pertaining to satellite images for the past 60 years were used to analyse climate and other geographical conditions in the study region. This chapter examines the geographical and geomorphic features of habitat, environmental adaptation and settlement pattern of human populations in space and time through geospatial analysis. Some archaeological sites as case studies were investigated for surfacial and sub-surfacial data collection. The results of terrain analysis revealed that elevation, slope and aspect had played a vital role in human settlement locations. The evidence of climate change and variability in the case study sites showed early human adaptation strategies including settlement abandonment and migration. The use of geospatial analysis has provided better insight to relate early human settlement and environment. Further our investigations revealed threats caused by natural calamities and human vandalism to the most precious archaeological and cultural heritage sites, the promoters of tourism and plausible solutions.},

 abstract = {Organismal survival depends on a well-balanced immune system and maintenance of host-microbe mutualism. The fine-tuned relationship between the gut microbiota and host immunity is constantly challenged by opportunistic bacteria testing the integrity of gastrointestinal (GI) barrier defenses. Barrier dysfunction reduces immunological tolerance towards otherwise innocuous microbes; it is a process that may instigate chronic inflammation. Paradoxically, sustained inflammation further diminishes barrier function, enabling bacterial translocation to extra-intestinal tissues. Once translocated, these bacteria stimulate systemic inflammation, thereby compromising organ function. While genetic risk alleles associate with barrier dysfunction, environmental stressors are key triggers of GI inflammation and associated breakdown in immune tolerance towards resident gut microbes. As dietary components dictate substrate availability, they also orchestrate microbiota composition and function, including migratory and pro-inflammatory potential, thus holding the capacity to fuel both GI and extra-intestinal inflammation. Additionally, Western diet consumption may weaken barrier defenses via curbed Paneth cell function and diminished host-defense peptide secretion. This review focuses on intervenable niches of host-microbe interactions and mucosal immunity with the ambition to provide a framework of plausible strategies to improve barrier function and regain tolerance in the inflamed mucosa via nutritional intervention.},

Though the overall health situation of the host and the contribution of intestinal micro-biota have been a popular area of research, yet there are numerous gaps to be filled and the exact mechanisms are yet to be found out. This chapter intends to provide an overview of the influence of diet on gut microbiota and interventions on the modulation of gut microbiota. The chapter provides information of various gut microbiodata, evalution, relation with diet, nutrient, and overall health benefits. The gut microbiota plays numerous roles in host metabolism and maintaining host immunity and health, elevating its status to that of a forgotten organ. Gut microbiota takes part in diverse functions including nutrient metabolism, gut barrier integrity, antimicrobial protection and immunomodulation. In nutrient metabolism, gut microbiota plays an important role. The antimicrobial substances produced by the resident microbes also inhibit the growth of pathogens. The digestion and absorption of dietary components are greatly influenced by the gut microbiota. There are the fundamental role and mutual interaction between the gut microbes and the dietary components. A change in the dietary lipid can cause modulation in the gut microbiota composition. The dietary intervention is the most cost-effective and the easiest method to manipulate the gut microbiome.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are novel drugs that have proven efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes. Roles for the PCSK9 molecule in metabolic pathways beyond LDL receptor processing and cholesterol homeostasis are well established. PCSK9 genetic variants associated with lower LDL-C levels correlate with a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), calling into question the appropriateness of these drugs in patients with T2DM and those at high risk of developing diabetes, and whether cardiovascular benefit seen with PCSK9 inhibitors might be offset by resultant dysglycemia. The purpose of this review was to examine the role of PCSK9 protein in glucose homeostasis, the impact of PCSK9 inhibition in relation to glucose homeostasis, and whether some of the cardiovascular benefit seen with PCSK9 inhibitors and statins might be offset by resultant dysglycemia.
METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches of electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and OVID were conducted by using the search terms hyperlipidaemia, PCSK9, diabetes, and glucose as well as other relevant papers of interest collected by the authors. The retrieved papers were reviewed and shortlisted most relevant ones.
FINDINGS: Genetically determined lower circulating LDL-C and PCSK9 concentrations may have an incremental effect in increasing T2DM incidence, but any perceived harm is outweighed by the reduced risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease achieved through lower lifetime exposure to LDL-C. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are effective and safe in patients with T2DM and those at high risk of developing it. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent one atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) study in the subgroup with diabetes is significantly lower than for those without. Therefore, T2DM or being at high risk to develop it should not be a reason to avoid these agents. The safety of PCSK9 inhibition in relation to glucose homeostasis may depend on the method of inhibition and whether it occurs in circulation or the cells. Data from experimental studies and randomized controlled trials suggest no detrimental effect of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on glucose homeostasis. More data and large randomized controlled studies are needed to assess the impact of other methods of PCSK9 inhibition on glucose homeostasis.
IMPLICATIONS: PCSK9monoclonal antibodies markedly reduce LDL-C and consistently reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Current evidence does not suggest an adverse effect of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on glycemic parameters.},

 abstract = {Humans are standouts in their propensity to trade. More specially, the kind of trading found in humans—featuring the exchange of many different goods and services with many different others, for the mutual benefit of all the involved parties—far exceeds anything that is found in any other creature. However, a number of important questions about this propensity remain open. First, it is not clear exactly what makes this propensity so different in the human case from that of other animals. Second, it is not clear why other animals did not acquire this propensity to the extent that humans did. Third, it is not clear what explains the fact that the extent to which humans engage in trade is culturally highly variable. The paper argues that at the heart of the human-animal divergence in this propensity is the particular socio-cultural environment in which humans evolved. This has led them to sometimes, but not always, acquire the cognitive technology (writing, algebra, tallying devices, money, etc.) to support a sophisticated disposition and capacity for reciprocal cooperation, and deep and wide concepts of property and exchange value.},

 abstract = {Social foraging decisions depend on individual payoffs. However, it is unclear how individual variation in phenotypic and behavioural traits can influence these payoffs, thereby the decisions to forage socially or individually. Here, we studied how individual traits influence foraging tactics of net-casting fishers who interact with wild dolphins. While net-casting is primarily an individual activity, in the traditional fishery with dolphins, fishers can choose between fishing in cooperative groups or solitarily. Our semi-structured interviews with fishers show their social network is mapped onto these foraging tactics. By quantifying the fishers’ catch, we found that fishers in cooperative groups catch more fish per capita than solitary fishers. By quantifying foraging and social traits of fishers, we found that the choice between foraging tactics—and whom to cooperate with—relates to differences in peer reputation and to similarities in number of friends, propensity to fish with relatives, and frequency of interaction with dolphins. These findings indicate different payoffs between foraging tactics and that by choosing the cooperative partner fishers likely access other benefits such as social prestige and embeddedness. These findings reveal the importance of not only material but also non-material benefits of social foraging tactics, which can have implications for the dynamics of this rare fishery. Faced with the current fluctuation in fishing resource availability, the payoffs of both tactics may change, affecting the fishers’ social and foraging decisions, potentially threatening the persistence of this century-old fishery involving humans and wildlife.Significance statementSocial foraging theory proposes that decisions to forage in groups are primarily driven by cost–benefit trade-offs that individuals experience, but it remains unclear whether, and how much, individual foragers’ characteristics influence these trade-offs and consequently the choice to forage in social groups. We study the artisanal net-casting fishers who choose between cooperating with each other or fishing alone when engaging in a rare interaction with wild dolphins. Our findings suggest that cooperative fishers capture more fish than solitary fishers, and that by choosing cooperative partners based on similarities and differences in key social (peer reputation, kinship, friendships) and foraging (fishing frequency) traits; these fishers also experience higher social prestige and more social embeddedness. These results suggest that material gains from foraging—but also non-material benefits accrued from socializing with like-minded individuals—can influence the dynamics of human social foraging.},

 abstract = {Abstract
Schooling is ubiquitous in the modern world and academic development is now a critical aspect of preparation for adulthood. A step back in time to pre-modern societies and an examination of life in remaining traditional societies today reveals that universal formal schooling is an historically recent phenomenon. This evolutionary and historical recency has profound implications for understanding academic development, including how instructional practices modify evolved or biological primary abilities (e.g., spoken language) to create evolutionarily novel or biologically secondary academic competencies (e.g., reading). We propose the development of secondary abilities promotes the emergence of academic self-concepts that in turn are supported by evolved systems for self-awareness and self-knowledge. Unlike some forms of self-knowledge (e.g., relative physical abilities) that appear to be universal and central to many people’s overall self-concept, the relative importance of academic self-concepts are expected to be dependent on explicit social and cultural supports for their valuation. These culturally contingent self-concepts are contrasted with universal social and physical self-concepts, with implications for understanding variation students’ relative valuation of academic competencies and their motivations to engage in academic learning.},

Recent ideas, framed as the 4E perspective to cognition, highlight that human experience depends causally on both cerebral and extracranial processes, but also is embedded in a particular sociomaterial context and is a product of historical accumulation of trajectory changes throughout life. Accordingly, the human microbiome is one of the most intriguing actors modulating brain function and physiology. Here, we present the 4E approach to the Human Microbiome for understanding mental processes from a broader perspective, encompassing one's body physiology and environment throughout their lifespan, interconnected by microbiome community structure and dynamics. We review evidence supporting the approach theoretically and motivates the study of the global set of microbial ecosystem networks encountered by a person across their lifetime (from skin to gut to natural and built environments). We furthermore trace future empirical implementation of the approach. We finally discuss novel research opportunities and clinical interventions aimed toward developing low-cost/high-benefit integrative and personalized bio-psycho-socio-environmental treatments for mental health and including the brain-gut-microbiome axis.},

 abstract = {Hunter decision-making influences prey selection and is key to understanding the impacts of hunting on biodiversity. Optimal foraging theory (OFT) is often used to describe the decision-making and prey selection of subsistence hunters. We examined the behavior and game meat use of hunters in an indigenous Amazonian community and used free listing and generalized linear mixed-effects models under the framework of OFT to assess the decision-making of individuals who hunt for economic gain and subsistence. We found that prey selection generally followed OFT, and was influenced by hunters’ skills, patch choice, and characteristics of the prey encountered. Hunters preferred paca (Cuniculus paca), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and brocket deer (Mazama americana), and only partially preferred tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large-bodied primates likely due to economic influences such as access to markets and prices, contrary to OFT predictions.},

 abstract = {The digestive tract microorganisms play a very important role in the host's nutrient intake, environmental suitability, and affect the host's physiological mechanism. Previous studies showed that in different seasons, mammalian gut microbes would be different. However, most of them are concentrated in wild animals. It remains unclear how seasonal change affects the gut microbes of Chinese merino fine-wool Sheep. Therefore, in this experiment, we continuously collected blood and feces samples of 50 Chinese merino fine-wool sheep in different seasons, measured the physiological indicators of blood, and passed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, determined the microbial community structure of fecal microorganisms and predicted flora function by PICRUSt. The results of blood physiological indicators showed that WBC, Neu and Bas in spring were significantly higher than those of other seasons. Fecal microbial sequencing revealed seasonal changes in gut microbial diversity and richness. Among them, Chinese merino fine-wool sheep had the highest gut microbes in summer. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, and they were unaffected by seasonal fluctuations. LEfSE analysis was used to analyze representative microorganisms in different seasons. The Lachnospiraceae and its genera (<i>Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, g_unclassified_f_ Lachnospiraceae</i>) were representative microorganisms in the three seasons of spring, summer and winter with harsh environmental conditions; while in autumn with better environmental conditions, the Ruminococcaceae and its genus (<i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005</i>) were the representative microorganism. In autumn, the ABC transporter and the pyruvate metabolic pathway were significantly higher than other seasons. Correlation analysis results showed that Lachnospiraceae participated in the ABC transporters metabolic pathway, which caused changes in the blood physiological indicators. Overall, our results showed that, in response to seasonal changes, Chinese merino fine-wool sheep under house-feeding have adjusted their own gut microbial community structure, causing changes in the metabolism, and thus changing the physiological conditions of the blood. In the cold season, producers should focus on regulating the nutritional level of feed, enhancing the level of butyric acid in young animals to increase the ABC transporter, resist the external harsh environment, and improve the survival rate.},

 abstract = {The 1013–1014 microorganisms present in the human gut (collectively known as the human gut microbiota) dedicate substantial percentages of their genomes to the degradation and uptake of carbohydrates, indicating the importance of this class of molecules. Carbohydrates function not only as a carbon source for these bacteria but also as a means of attachment to the host, and a barrier to infection of the host. In this Review, we focus on the diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), how gut microorganisms use them for carbohydrate degradation, the different chemical mechanisms of these CAZymes and the roles that these microorganisms and their CAZymes have in human health and disease. We also highlight examples of how enzymes from this treasure trove have been used in manipulation of the microbiota for improved health and treatment of disease, in remodelling the glycans on biopharmaceuticals and in the potential production of universal O-type donor blood.},

 abstract = {Processed foods often include food additives such as xanthan gum, a complex polysaccharide with unique rheological properties, that has established widespread use as a stabilizer and thickening agent. Xanthan gum’s chemical structure is distinct from those of host and dietary polysaccharides that are more commonly expected to transit the gastrointestinal tract, and little is known about its direct interaction with the gut microbiota, which plays a central role in digestion of other dietary fibre polysaccharides. Here we show that the ability to digest xanthan gum is common in human gut microbiomes from industrialized countries and appears contingent on a single uncultured bacterium in the family Ruminococcaceae. Our data reveal that this primary degrader cleaves the xanthan gum backbone before processing the released oligosaccharides using additional enzymes. Some individuals harbour Bacteroides intestinalis that is incapable of consuming polymeric xanthan gum but grows on oligosaccharide products generated by the Ruminococcaceae. Feeding xanthan gum to germfree mice colonized with a human microbiota containing the uncultured Ruminococcaceae supports the idea that the additive xanthan gum can drive expansion of the primary degrader Ruminococcaceae, along with exogenously introduced B. intestinalis. Our work demonstrates the existence of a potential xanthan gum food chain involving at least two members of different phyla of gut bacteria and provides an initial framework for understanding how widespread consumption of a recently introduced food additive influences human microbiomes.},

 abstract = {The question about genetic causes of a global decrease in male fertility observed in recent decades in many countries is among the hot spots of reproductive genetics. An impairment of the hormonal regulation of reproductive processes is one of the causes of male infertility and subfertility. Androgens, which are secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes are required for sexual differentiation, pubertal development, spermatogenesis and sexual behavior. Many physiological functions of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR) that belongs to the family of steroid hormone receptors, and the gene encoding the AR is localized on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq12 locus). The AR gene has two polymorphic trinucleotide repeats (CAG and GGC) in exon 1. The association of AR gene (CAG)n and (GGC)n polymorphism with different diseases is intensively studied (including male infertility and spermatogenesis disorders). The aim of this review is to summarize current views on the role of CAG and GGC polymorphism of the AR gene in male fertility and to systematize the results of population studies on ethnic variability in the length of AR CAG and GGC repeats and the association with male infertility, semen parameters and androgen production. Available data confirm the association of CAG and GGC repeat of the AR gene with the risk of male infertility and pathozoospermia, while identification of the number of repeats can be an efficient way to estimate the risk of male infertility and to control the hormone therapy with androgens.},

 abstract = {North American Indigenous (NAI) youth suffers disproportionately from consequences associated with alcohol use. Previous research has found that positive alcohol expectancies are robustly related to alcohol consumption among NAI youth and that changes in alcohol consumption are associated with concurrent changes in happiness. However, no work to date has examined the relation between happiness and alcohol expectancies, or the influence of happiness on the association between alcohol expectancies and alcohol consumption. First Nation adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 living on a rural reserve in Eastern Canada (<i>N</i> = 106, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 14.6 years, 50.0% female) completed a pencil-and-paper survey regarding their subjective happiness, positive alcohol expectancies, and alcohol consumption. Moderation analyses revealed a significant main effect of subjective happiness (<i>b</i> = -.10, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) but not alcohol expectancies (<i>b</i> = .02, <i>p</i> = .14) on alcohol consumption. The interaction of alcohol expectancies and subjective happiness was significant, (<i>b</i> = -.01, <i>p</i> = .002). Analysis of simple slopes revealed that the effect of alcohol expectancies on alcohol consumption was significant for those reporting low (<i>b</i> = .07, <i>p</i> = .001), but not high levels of subjective happiness (<i>b</i> = -.02, <i>p</i> = .25). Results of the present study provide preliminary support for the utility of positive psychological interventions aiming to increase adolescent's subjective happiness to indirectly target alcohol consumption. Future work should test the effectiveness of such interventions and aim to replicate these findings in larger samples. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},

Two types of processes are distinguished, namely dispersing and concentrating ones. A basic result shows that dispersing processes provide a selective advantage for more balanced and mutualistic interaction; whereas concentrating ones favor weaker, less balanced and less mutualistic interaction. We also show that societies with more balanced and mutualistic interaction induce more income equality and a non-stratified society, while less balanced and less mutualistic ones induce more inequality and a possibly stratified society. Also, more equal societies are more resilient in the sense of being quicker to recover from shocks and return to steady state than less equal ones.

Many people perish on perilous treks around the world in search of a better life. However, there is not much being done to track down these people. DNA profiling has made it possible to track these migrants with its advanced techniques and established protocols. DNA profiling is still a gold standard technology for human identification. In the last three decades, genetic research has become increasingly applicable in the study of human history. Several advancements in our knowledge of human migration have been made possible by developments in the sequencing and study of both current and ancient peoples’ genomes. They have helped to prove that anatomically modern humans initially arose in Africa around 250,000–350,000 years ago and then spread to other provinces of the world, and the humans’ genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions are among them. Analyses of this original genetic data are transforming our understanding of humans’ migration history and adaption. We may now collect whole-genome sequences from a variety of existing and prehistoric Africans using today’s sequencing technologies. In the coming years, significant discoveries will be made in the study of human migration.},

 abstract = {We synthesize data on the ecology of large carnivores in the Tarangire Ecosystem (TE). Despite anthropogenic pressures, all large carnivore species (lions Panthera leo, spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta, striped hyena Hyena hyena, leopard Panthera pardus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, and wild dog Lycaon pictus) have persisted in this fragmented ecosystem consisting of multiple protected areas among a matrix of village lands. The focal species were widely distributed across land-use gradients. While the comparatively abundant spotted hyena permanently occupied village lands, other species only sporadically used these human-dominated areas. Across species, carnivores used village lands more frequently during the rainy season, possibly following seasonal shifts in the movement of prey species. These processes can increase human-carnivore interactions, expanding the potential for conflict. In some areas, leopards, lions, and striped hyenas reached high densities, whereas cheetahs and wild dogs occurred patchily and at low densities. Our review suggests that the existence of diverse protected areas contribute to the persistence of the large carnivore community. The persistence of lions, cheetahs, and wild dogs appears dependent on human-induced mortality and prey depletion. Conserving large carnivores in TE requires the application of interventions that reduce human-induced mortality while simultaneously conserving the spatio-temporal distributions of prey species.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiome performs many important functions in mammalian hosts, with community composition shaping its functional role. However, the factors that drive individual microbiota variation in wild animals and to what extent these are predictable or idiosyncratic across populations remains poorly understood. Here, we use a multi-population dataset from a common rodent species (the wood mouse, <i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>), to test whether a consistent "core" gut microbiota is identifiable in this species, and to what extent the predictors of microbiota variation are consistent across populations. Between 2014 and 2018 we used capture-mark-recapture and 16S rRNA profiling to intensively monitor two wild wood mouse populations and their gut microbiota, as well as characterising the microbiota from a laboratory-housed colony of the same species. Although the microbiota was broadly similar at high taxonomic levels, the two wild populations did not share a single bacterial amplicon sequence variant (ASV), despite being only 50km apart. Meanwhile, the laboratory-housed colony shared many ASVs with one of the wild populations from which it is thought to have been founded decades ago. Despite not sharing any ASVs, the two wild populations shared a phylogenetically more similar microbiota than either did with the colony, and the factors predicting compositional variation in each wild population were remarkably similar. We identified a strong and consistent pattern of seasonal microbiota restructuring that occurred at both sites, in all years, and within individual mice. While the microbiota was highly individualised, some seasonal convergence occurred in late winter/early spring. These findings reveal highly repeatable seasonal gut microbiota dynamics in multiple populations of this species, despite different taxa being involved. This provides a platform for future work to understand the drivers and functional implications of such predictable seasonal microbiome restructuring, including whether it might provide the host with adaptive seasonal phenotypic plasticity.},

 abstract = {Apex predators play an important role in the top-down regulation of ecological communities. Their hunting and feeding behaviors influence, respectively, prey demography and the availability of resources to other consumers. Among the most iconic—and enigmatic—terrestrial predators of the late Cenozoic are the Machairodontinae, a diverse group of big cats whose hypertrophied upper canines have earned them the moniker “sabertooths.” Many aspects of these animals’ paleobiology, especially their prey preferences and carcass consumption behavior, remain unsettled. While skeletal anatomy, dental morphology and wear, and isotopic profiles provide important insights, the most direct way to resolve these issues is through the fossil remains of sabertooth prey. Here, we report on a taphonomic analysis of an early Pleistocene faunal assemblage from Haile 21A (Florida, USA) that preserves feeding damage from the lion-sized sabertooth Xenosmilus hodsonae. Patterns of tooth-marking and bone damage indicate that Xenosmilus fully defleshed the carcasses of their prey and even engaged in some minor bone consumption. This has important implications for Pleistocene carnivoran guild dynamics, including the carcass foraging behavior of the first stone-tool-using hominins.},

Disruption of the symbiosis between host and gut microbiota, the so-called dysbiosis, as well as the inadequate diet from which it results, contribute to the etiology of immunometabolic disorders. Research into the development of these diseases is highly influenced by our understanding of the evolutionary roots of metabolic functioning, thereby considering that chronic non-communicable diseases arise from an evolutionary mismatch. However, the lens has been mostly directed toward energy availability and metabolism, but away from our closest environmental factor, the gut microbiota.

Organisms modulate various physiological mediators to respond to unpredictable changes in their environment. The gut microbiome is a key example of a physiological mediator that coordinates a myriad of host functions including counteracting stressors. Here, we highlight the gut microbiome as a mediator of host stress resilience in the framework of the reactive scope model. The reactive scope model integrates physiological mediators with unpredictable environmental changes to predict how animals respond to stressors. We provide examples of how the gut microbiome responds to stressors within the four ranges of the reactive scope model (i.e., predictive homeostasis, reactive homeostasis, homeostatic overload, and homeostatic failure). We identify measurable metrics of the gut microbiome that could be used to infer the degree to which the host is experiencing chronic stress, including microbial diversity, flexibility, and gene richness. The goal of this perspective piece is to highlight the underutilized potential of measuring the gut microbiome as a mediator of stress resilience in wild animal hosts.},

 abstract = {The study of human diet in the past investigates the presence and post-depositional survival of indicators to identify human interactions with animals and plants. When present, their recognition requires the use of high-resolution images to distinguish their provenance. Nevertheless, inconspicuous surface modifications, such as human tooth scores, are difficult to identify even through high quality images. The use of laser scanning confocal microscopy offers quality images, which when combined with morphometric values, provide means of differentiating between different types of anthropogenic bone surface modifications. This paper presents a neotaphonomic experimental study testing whether measurement types and magnification level affect the accuracy of established identifications methods for grouping different categories of human modifications related to the consumption of small vertebrates. Through the multivariate statistical analyses of repeated measures, this paper proposes the best combination of parameters to identify human tooth scores in small vertebrates using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results have implications for the study of human consumption of small prey, including rabbits, rodents, birds and reptiles, a key piece in the research of human occupation patterns and behaviour during the Pleistocene in Eurasia and Island Southeast Asia.},

 abstract = {Teaching likely evolved in humans to facilitate the faithful transmission of complex tasks. As the oldest evidenced hunting technology, spear hunting requires acquiring several complex physical and cognitive competencies. In this study, we used observational and interview data collected among BaYaka foragers (Republic of the Congo) to test the predictions that costlier teaching types would be observed at a greater frequency than less costly teaching in the domain of spear hunting and that teachers would calibrate their teaching to pupil skill level. To observe naturalistic teaching during spear hunting, we invited teacher-pupil groupings to spear hunt while wearing GoPro cameras. We analysed 68 h of footage totalling 519 teaching episodes. Most observed teaching events were costly. Direct instruction was the most frequently observed teaching type. Older pupils received less teaching and more opportunities to lead the spear hunt than their younger counterparts. Teachers did not appear to adjust their teaching to pupil experience, potentially because age was a more easily accessible heuristic for pupil skill than experience. Our study shows that costly teaching is frequently used to transmit complex tasks and that instruction may play a privileged role in the transmission of spear hunting knowledge.},

Researchers have hypothesized that play with objects may have a foundational role in the ontogeny of tool use and, over evolutionary timescales, in cumulative technological innovation. Yet, there are few systematic studies investigating children's interactions with objects outside the post-industrialized West. Here, we survey the ethnohistorical record to uncover cross-cultural trends regarding hunter-gatherer children's use of objects during play and instrumental activities. Our dataset, consisting of 434 observations of children's toys and tools from 54 hunter-gatherer societies, reveals several salient trends: Most objects in our dataset are used in play. Children readily manufacture their own toys, such as dolls and shelters. Most of the objects that children interact with are constructed from multiple materials. Most of the objects in our dataset are full-sized or miniature versions of adult tools, reflecting learning for adult roles. Children also engage with objects related to child culture, primarily during play. Taken together, our findings show that hunter-gatherer children grow up playing, making, and learning with objects.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
                
                  Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) represent individual genomes recovered from metagenomic data. MAGs are extremely useful to analyse uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAGs reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the non-binning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used, however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAGs recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to co-assemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAGs reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated co-assembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAGs recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at:
                  https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird_pipeline_registry/magneto
                  .
                
                
                  IMPORTANCE
                  
                    Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic datasets. We propose a novel approach to automate co-assembly, avoiding the requirement for
                    a priori
                    knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous co-assembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing co-assembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes. MAGNETO integrates complementary assembly-binning strategies to optimize genome reconstruction and provides a complete reads-to-genomes workflow for the growing microbiome research community.

The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol sulfate (PCS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDM generation; however, it is unclear if inter-individual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here, we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. During dietary homogeneity, the coefficient of variation in PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome) did not decrease, nor did inter-individual variation in most identified metabolites; other microbiome metrics showed no or modest responses to the intervention. Host identity and age are dominant contributors to variability in MDMs. These results highlight the potential need to pair dietary modification with microbial therapies to control MDM profiles.},

 abstract = {Across vertebrates, testosterone is an important mediator of reproductive trade-offs, shaping how energy and time are devoted to parenting versus mating/competition. Based on early environments, organisms often calibrate adult hormone production to adjust reproductive strategies. For example, favorable early nutrition predicts higher adult male testosterone in humans, and animal models show that developmental social environments can affect adult testosterone. In humans, fathers’ testosterone often declines with caregiving, yet these patterns vary within and across populations. This may partially trace to early social environments, including caregiving styles and family relationships, which could have formative effects on testosterone production and parenting behaviors. Using data from a multidecade study in the Philippines (n = 966), we tested whether sons’ developmental experiences with their fathers predicted their adult testosterone profiles, including after they became fathers themselves. Sons had lower testosterone as parents if their own fathers lived with them and were involved in childcare during adolescence. We also found a contributing role for adolescent father–son relationships: sons had lower waking testosterone, before and after becoming fathers, if they credited their own fathers with their upbringing and resided with them as adolescents. These findings were not accounted for by the sons’ own parenting and partnering behaviors, which could influence their testosterone. These effects were limited to adolescence: sons’ infancy or childhood experiences did not predict their testosterone as fathers. Our findings link adolescent family experiences to adult testosterone, pointing to a potential pathway related to the intergenerational transmission of biological and behavioral components of reproductive strategies.},

 abstract = {Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are Critically Endangered and show continued population decline. Consequently, pressure is mounting to better understand their conservation threats and ecology. Gastrointestinal symbionts, such as bacterial and eukaryotic communities, are believed to play vital roles in the physiological landscape of the host. Gorillas host a broad spectrum of eucaryotes, so called parasites, with strongylid nematodes being particularly prevalent. While these communities are partially consistent, they are also shaped by various ecological factors, such as diet or habitat type. To investigate gastrointestinal symbionts of wild western lowland gorillas, we analysed 215 faecal samples from individuals in five distinct localities across the Congo Basin, using high-throughput sequencing techniques. We describe the gut bacterial microbiome and genetic diversity of strongylid communities, including strain-level identification of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). We identified strongylid ASVs from eight genera and bacterial ASVs from 20 phyla. We compared these communities across localities, with reference to varying environmental factors among populations, finding differences in alpha diversity and community compositions of both gastrointestinal components. Moreover, we also investigated covariation between strongylid nematodes and the bacterial microbiome, finding correlations between strongylid taxa and Prevotellaceae and Rikenellaceae ASVs that were consistent across multiple localities. Our research highlights the complexity of the bacterial microbiome and strongylid communities in several gorilla populations and emphasizes potential interactions between these two symbiont communities. This study provides a framework for ongoing research into strongylid nematode diversity, and their interactions with the bacterial microbiome, among great apes.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews changes to lifecycle temporality in Southwest Asian plant and animal domestication, exploring their relationship to long-term processes associated with ancient and contemporary globalization. We survey changes under domestication to the timing of seed dispersal, germination, vegetative growth, flowering and maturation in wheat and barley and to birth, reproduction, lactation, wool production and death in sheep, goats and cattle. Changes in biological temporality among domesticates are ultimately related to globally increasing production intensity, geographic diffusion, and agricultural diversity associated with cultivar/breed evolution. Recently, however, increasing crop production intensity and geographic diffusion are accompanied by declining agricultural diversity worldwide. Similar processes are apparent in contemporary economic and cultural globalization, suggesting that long-term agricultural developments might be viewed as a subset of globalization. Moreover, the origin of certain features of contemporary globalization may be traced back to the beginnings of plant and animal domestication. Thus, while biologists since Darwin considered domestication as a model for the study of evolution, we suggest that domestication may also offer a model for the study of globalization.},

Although the genetic adaptability of yak and rumen metagenomes is increasingly understood, the relative contribution of host genetics and maternal symbiotic microbes throughout early intestinal microbial successions in yaks remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the intestinal microbiota succession of co-inhabiting yak and cattle (<i>Bos taurus</i>) calves at different weeks after birth as well as the modes of transmission of maternal symbiotic microbes (i.e., rumen fluid, feces, oral cavity, and breast skin) to their calves' intestinal microbiota colonization. We found that the fecal microbiota of yak and cattle calves after birth was dominated by members of the families <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>. The Source Tracker model revealed that maternal fecal microbes played an important role (the average contribution was about 80%) in the intestinal microbial colonization of yak and cattle calves at different weeks after birth. Unlike cattle calves, there was no significant difference in the fecal microbiota composition of yak calves between 5 and 9 weeks after birth (Wilcoxon test, <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), indicating that yak may adapt to its natural extreme environment to stabilize its intestinal microbiota composition. Additionally, our results also find that the intestinal microbial composition of yak and cattle calves, with age, gradually tend to become similar, and the differences between species gradually decrease. The findings of this study are vital for developing strategies to manipulate the intestinal microbiota in grazing yaks and cattle for better growth and performance on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.},

These interactions provide important benefits to both the human and wildlife communities involved, have wider impacts on the local ecosystem, and represent a unique intersection of human and animal cultures. The remaining active forms are human-honeyguide and human-dolphin cooperation, but these are at risk of joining several inactive forms (including human-wolf and human-orca cooperation). Human-wildlife cooperation faces a unique set of conservation challenges, as it requires multiple components-a motivated human and wildlife partner, a suitable environment, and compatible interspecies knowledge-which face threats from ecological and cultural changes. To safeguard human-wildlife cooperation, we recommend: (i) establishing ethically sound conservation strategies together with the participating human communities; (ii) conserving opportunities for human and wildlife participation; (iii) protecting suitable environments; (iv) facilitating cultural transmission of traditional knowledge; (v) accessibly archiving Indigenous and scientific knowledge; and (vi) conducting long-term empirical studies to better understand these interactions and identify threats. Tailored safeguarding plans are therefore necessary to protect these diverse and irreplaceable interactions.

However, little research has examined the factors that influenced small game hunting in the arid and semi-arid tropics of eastern Africa during this period. To address this research gap, we report on a large MIS 2/1 (N = 81,986) faunal assemblage from Guli Waabayo rock shelter in southern Somalia. Dates from the site show repeated Later Stone Age (LSA) forager occupation throughout the mostly arid MIS 2 and wetter African Humid Period (AHP; 14.7–5 ka). Evidence of a major lithic transition between MIS 2 and the AHP suggests changing LSA mobility patterns and economic systems corresponded with regional precipitation fluctuations. However, unusually high frequencies of small taxa (e.g., dik-dik, rock hyrax, monitor lizard) and fewer large and medium species (e.g., kudu and warthog) throughout the Guli Waabayo sequence crosscut both climatic and technological changes. These findings contrast with studies in other world regions that emphasize small game hunting in response to environmental reorganization, changing forager land use strategies, and large game overhunting.},

The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of the research on fire among Neanderthals. We compiled and reviewed the archaeological evidence and scientific studies on the topic, including different methodological approaches, theoretical considerations about the complexity of fire as an element of technology, and different interpretations regarding the Neanderthals’ ability to make fire. Approaching fire as an artefact through experimental research, ethnography, and archaeology at different scales of observation and using different methods has furnished a robust data set that allows us to objectively interpret Neanderthal behaviour around fire, such as in fuel gathering, fire lighting, use, and reuse. This research paves the way to identify cultural aspects of pyrotechnology and understand Neanderthal social behaviour around fire.},

Ms all de este inters, existen fuentes de variacin a nivel de las historias de vida que resultan poco visibles en el registro arqueolgico y han recibido poca atencin. Sin embargo, el registro etnogrfico global muestra que las historias de vida son claves y tambin lo habran sido en escala arqueolgica. Para conectar estas dimensiones, exploramos diferentes niveles de la movilidad, considerando esferas de movimientos cotidianos y disruptivos. Proponemos un modelo de base etnogrfica que conecta formas generales de organizacin del parentesco con las historias de vida. Luego, exploramos una va de contrastacin del modelo mediante istopos de estroncio (87Sr/86Sr), que permiten estudiar el rango geogrfico de movimientos, y de istopos estables (carbono y nitrgeno), que ofrecen un marcador de amplitud de nichos. Aplicamos este modelo a dos regiones del norte de la Provincia de Mendoza (Argentina): Barrancas, situada en las planicies orientales (2500-2000 aos cal. AP), y Valle de Uspallata (1200-700 aos cal. AP). El anlisis permite evaluar la escala de movilidad diaria, la estabilidad en la vida de los individuos, la existencia de sistemas intensivos y extensivos de organizacin del parentesco y la incidencia de procesos de migracin. Abstract: Mobility is a key issue in the archaeology of southern South America, providing a lens through which multiple aspects of past social and economic organization can be visualized. Beyond this focus, there are multiple sources of behavioral variation that have little archaeological visibility and are thus seldom considered. However, the global ethnographic record shows that these aspects play a key role which may have also been significative at the archaeological scale. To connect these analytical levels, we explore different dimensions of daily and anomalous-potentially disruptive-human mobility. We develop an ethnography-based model that centers on individual life histories and incorporates aspects of mobility and kinship organization. Building on this, we present a first archaeological evaluation based on strontium isotopes, which allows us to track paleomobility, and stable isotopes, providing insights on paleodiet and niche width. This is applied to two archaeological contexts from northern Mendoza Province (Argentina): Barrancas, located in the eastern lowlands (2000-2300 cal BP) and the Uspallata Valley, between the geological units of the Precordillera and Cordillera Frontal (1200-700 cal years BP). The analysis enables us to evaluate the scale of daily mobility, stability of life histories, existence of different forms of kinship organization, and the incidence of migration.},

 abstract = {Previous research has suggested that reduced humeral asymmetry in robusticity in European Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene populations may be a result of increased left humeral robusticity due to muscle loading from increased use of bow hunting. This paper provides a basis for considering the causes of such changes by assessing the overall intensity and level of asymmetry in the distribution of muscle activation and muscle force among living male archers. In this experiment, 20 right-handed archers drew a replica of the self bows characteristic for the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic. We measured activation of eight muscles (biceps, triceps [long head], triceps [lateral head], deltoid [anterior part], deltoid [middle part], deltoid [posterior part], infraspinatus, and latissimus) using surface electromyography. We observed about a 15%–28% left bias in total maximum muscle force. The main muscles employed were triceps (lateral head), deltoid (middle part), and deltoid (posterior part) on both sides and triceps (long head) on the left arm. The most asymmetrical toward the right arm was the activation of biceps (123% right bias in mean muscle activation) and toward the left was triceps (long head) and triceps (lateral head) (70%–110% left bias in mean muscle activation). We conclude that left biased asymmetry in maximum muscle force produced during bow shooting may be responsible for the increase in robusticity of the left humerus and that the pattern of activation of specific individual muscles suggests that archery may be identifiable in the prehistoric record using skeletal features associated with muscle activity.},

 abstract = {The peoples of the Swahili coast of eastern Africa established a literate urban culture by the second millennium CE. They traded across eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and were among the first sub-Saharan practitioners of Islam. An open question has been the extent to which these early interactions between Africans and non-Africans were accompanied by genetic admixture. We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 80 individuals in five medieval and early modern (1300-1800 CE) coastal towns, as well as people from an inland town postdating 1650 CE. Over half of the ancestry of most coastal individuals came from African ancestors; these African ancestors were primarily female. A slightly smaller proportion of ancestry was from Asia. This Asian component was approximately eighty to ninety percent from Near Eastern males and ten to twenty percent from Indian females. Peoples of African and Asian origins began to mix by around 1000 CE, a time when archaeological evidence documents changes on the coast that are often interpreted as marking the large-scale adoption of Islam. Before roughly 1500 CE, the Near Eastern ancestry detected in the individuals was mainly Persian-related, consistent with the narrative of the Kilwa Chronicle, the oldest history told by the Swahili themselves. After this time, the sources of Near Eastern ancestry became increasingly Arabian, consistent with the archaeological and historical evidence of growing interactions between the Swahili coast and parts of southern Arabia. Subsequent interactions of Swahili coast peoples with other Asian and African groups further changed the ancestry of present-day peoples relative to the ancient individuals we sequenced, highlighting how Swahili genetic legacies can be more clearly understood with ancient DNA.},

 abstract = {Researchers commonly use puppets in development science. Amongst other things, puppets are employed to reduce social hierarchies between child participants and adult experimenters akin to peer interactions. However, it remains controversial whether children treat puppets like real-world social partners in these settings. This study investigated children's imitation of causally irrelevant actions (i.e., over-imitation) performed by puppet, adult, or child models. Seventy-two German children (Age<sub>Range</sub>  = 4.6-6.5 years; 36 girls) from urban, socioeconomically diverse backgrounds observed a model retrieving stickers from reward containers. The model performed causally irrelevant actions either in contact with the reward container or not. Children were more likely to over-imitate adults' and peers' actions as compared to puppets' actions. Across models, they copied contact actions more than no-contact actions. While children imitate causally irrelevant actions from puppet models to some extent, their social learning from puppets does not necessarily match their social learning from real-world social agents, such as children or adults. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: We examined children's over-imitation from adult, child, and puppet models to validate puppetry as an approach to simulate non-hierarchical interactions. Children imitated adults and child models at slightly higher rates than puppets. This effect was present regardless of whether the irrelevant actions involved physical contact to the reward container or not. In our study children's social learning from puppets does not match their social learning from human models.},

 abstract = {Abstract
Serrated stone points have been documented in a variety of archaeological settings worldwide. In Indonesia, serrated points known as Maros point began to appear during the mid-Holocene as part of the Toalean techno-complex in southern South Sulawesi. Researchers have speculated functional and cultural reason behind the emergence of these distinctive artefact as projectile points, an assumption that has yet to be verified by archaeological data. In particular, the edge serration has been suggested to allow for deeper penetration and/or act as barbs to prevent the easy withdrawal of the points from the target. In this study, we experimentally test these functional hypotheses regarding the effect of edge serration on stone arrowheads resembling Maros points when fired using different bow draw weights. We also investigate variation in breakage and impact fracture pattern between serrated and non-serrated points. Our result show that, compared to the non-serrated points, the serrated arrows not only deliver deeper penetrations, but also require less force to withdraw from the ballistic gel target. However, these relationships are complicated by the inclusion of skin and bone in the ballistic target. The findings demonstrate that the effect of serrated stone points on projectile performance depends on factors such as the projectile delivery system and prey type. Moreover, under identical firing settings, the serrated points develop more variable macrofracture patterns than the non-serrated points, likely owing the irregular edge morphologies. Taking these results together, we discuss the implications of our experimental study on the appearance of Maros points and the Toalean techno-complex in South Sulawesi during the mid-Holocene.},

 abstract = {The Interaction Engine Hypothesis postulates that humans have a unique ability and motivation for social interaction. A crucial juncture in the ontogeny of the interaction engine could be around 2-4 years of age, but observational studies of children in natural contexts are limited. These data appear critical also for comparison with non-human primates. Here, we report on focal observations on 31 children aged 2- and 4-years old in four preschools (10 h per child). Children interact with a wide range of partners, many infrequently, but with one or two close friends. Four-year olds engage in cooperative social interactions more often than 2-year olds and fight less than 2-year olds. Conversations and playing with objects are the most frequent social interaction types in both age groups. Children engage in social interactions with peers frequently (on average 13 distinct social interactions per hour) and briefly (28 s on average) and shorter than those of great apes in comparable studies. Their social interactions feature entry and exit phases about two-thirds of the time, less frequently than great apes. The results support the Interaction Engine Hypothesis, as young children manifest a remarkable motivation and ability for fast-paced interactions with multiple partners. This article is part of the theme issue 'Revisiting the human 'interaction engine': comparative approaches to social action coordination'.},

Dietary fiber is broken down into monosaccharides and then is fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microorganisms of chickens. However, research on impacts of it on the gut microbiota of chickens was limited. Given this, three different levels (0%, 1%, and 2%) of eubiotic lignocellulose were added to the feed of ISA brown hens for 0–8 weeks, with the aim of observing the impacts of it on the performance, gut microbiota, and SCFAs. The results showed that there were no significant effects on the performance and the development of the cecum (P > 0.05); however, added eubiotic lignocellulose increased the relative abundance of the most excellent fiber-degradation species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and fiber digestibility (P < 0.05). The addition of 1% significantly increased Lactobacillus panis and Oscillospira (P < 0.05), resulting in increasing of the production of SCFAs. Adding 1% eubiotic lignocellulose is appropriate in this experiment, but one or more group less than 1% (e.g., 0.75%, 0.5%, or 0.25%) should be set to verify the impact and determine a more appropriate amount of it added in the feed of chickens between 0 and 8 weeks in the future.},

 abstract = {People believe that effort is valuable, but what kind of value does it confer? We find that displays of effort signal moral character. Eight studies (<i>N</i> = 5,502) demonstrate the nature of these effects in the domains of paid employment, personal fitness, and charitable fundraising. The exertion of effort is deemed morally admirable (Studies 1-6) and is monetarily rewarded (Studies 2-6), even in situations where effort does not directly generate additional product, quality, or economic value. Convergent patterns of results emerged in South Korean and French cross-cultural replications (Studies 2b and 2c). We contend that the seeming irrationality of valuing effort for its own sake, such as in situations where one's efforts do not directly increase economic output (Studies 3-6), reveals a "deeply rational" social heuristic for evaluating potential cooperation partners. Specifically, effort cues engender broad moral trait ascriptions, and this moralization of effort influences donation behaviors (Study 5) and cooperative partner choice decision-making (Studies 4 and 6). In situating our account of effort moralization into past research and theorizing, we also consider the implications of these effects for social welfare policy and the future of work.

 abstract = {Background The Industrial Revolution presented technological advancements that improved shelflife, palatability, convenience, availability, and safety of foods. These advancements led to reduced micronutrient-related diseases, greater food diversity, and enhanced food security; however, their chronic consumption, starting in the 1960s, has been implicated in epidemics of diet-related chronic diseases. Scope and approach This commentary implies that diet potentially alters the human genome, evidenced by isolated populations consuming high starch versus low starch over successive generations. The control of fire and subsequent application to cooking illustrate that food processing potentially acts as an evolutionary discourse, and selective pressure favors less tooth dentation. Each is important to establish that the lack of whole food structure, the introduction of xenobiotics, and refined components in ultra-processed foods is an evolutionary discourse. Key findings and conclusions Over the past 100 years, the displacement of dietary patterns that include meals and dishes prepared from whole or minimally processed foods by those increasingly based on ultra-processed foods and drinks has occurred globally. Such rapid, neoteric changes to food choice/diet had not occurred since the onset of bipedally when Neanderthals ventured from the forest searching for new food sources in response to changing climates. Only time can tell if changes imparted by ultra-processed foods being Western Society's staple represent a significant enough environmental discourse to drive evolutionary adaptations. Epidemiological studies are already pointing to the parallel between the globalization of UPF consumption and the rapid emergence of chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide (244 words).},

This study aimed to assess the precision of the triangulation bee lining technique in locating Apis mellifera scutellata colonies within wild habitats, locate A. m. scutellata colony site population distribution and develop a predictive model of A. m. scutellata habitat suitability using SDM algorithms within Hurugwe Safari Area (HSA)-Rifa section, northern Zimbabwe. A survey of A. m. scutellata was carried out between February and October 2019. The triangulation bee lining technique was used to track wild bees to their colony sites. The bee lining technique was evaluated to assess its precision in locating honeybee colonies. Ensemble models were used to develop a predictive suitability niche ecosystem for A. m. scutellata nesting sites. The study located wild honeybee colonies using the triangulation bee lining technique with an 18% accuracy. Bee colonies were found at a mean distance of 27.7 m ± 2.06 from triangulated points. The predicted suitable areas were primarily areas close to the water sources and low-lying areas. The study recommended the use of the triangulation honeybee hunting method in locating wild honeybee colonies for research purposes, wild bee colony inspection for pests and diseases and sustainable organic honey collection.},

 abstract = {Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, formate, propionate, and butyrate are the end products of dietary fiber and host glycan fermentation by the human gut microbiota (HGM). SCFAs produced in the column are of utmost importance for host physiology and health. Butyrate and propionate improve gut health and play a key role in the neuroendocrine and immune systems. Prediction of HGM metabolic potential is important for understanding the influence of diet and HGM-produced metabolites on human health. We conducted a detailed metabolic reconstruction of pathways for the synthesis of SCFAs and L- and D-lactate, as additional fermentation products, in a reference set of 2,856 bacterial genomes representing strains of &gt;800 known HGM species. The reconstructed butyrate and propionate pathways included four and three pathway variants, respectively, that start from different metabolic precursors. Altogether, we identified 48 metabolic enzymes, including five alternative enzymes in propionate pathways, and propagated their occurrences across all studied genomes. We established genomic signatures for reconstructed pathways and classified genomes according to their simplified binary phenotypes encoding the ability ("1") or inability ("0") of a given organism to produce SCFAs. The resulting binary phenotypes combined into a binary phenotype matrix were used to assess the SCFA synthesis potential of HGM samples from several public metagenomic studies. We report baseline and variance for Community Phenotype Indices calculated for SCFAs production capabilities in 16S metagenomic samples of intestinal microbiota from two large national cohorts (American Gut Project, UK twins), the Hadza hunter-gatherers, and the young children cohort of infants with high-risk for type 1 diabetes. We further linked the predicted SCFA metabolic capabilities with available SCFA concentrations both for <i>in vivo</i> fecal samples and <i>in vitro</i> fermentation samples from previous studies. Finally, we analyzed differential representation of individual SCFA pathway genes across several WGS metagenomic datasets. The obtained collection of SCFA pathway genes and phenotypes enables the predictive metabolic phenotype profiling of HGM datasets and enhances the <i>in silico</i> methodology to study cross-feeding interactions in the gut microbiomes.},

 abstract = {L’archéologie de la préhistoire ne dispose pas des moyens d’observation directe de l’anthropologie sociale. Aussi, la question des indices de l’inégalité au Paléolithique est un sujet central, qui reste insuffisamment débattu. Suivant la tendance positiviste de l’archéologie, nous raisonnons actuellement plutôt en termes quantitatifs, mettant en avant les différences de richesses comme indices d’inégalités sociales transmises par hérédité, allant jusqu’à utiliser des outils économiques tels le coefficient de Gini comme révélateurs des degrés d’inégalités applicables aux sociétés du passé. Toutefois, en tirant de ces résultats chiffrés des conclusions sur l’organisation sociale, nous oublions de nous interroger sur le rapport entre inégalités de richesse et inégalités sociales. Avant même que n’intervienne une série de filtres déformants propres à l’archéologie (taphonomie, conservation, hypothèses de recherche, localisation des recherches, etc.), le degré de matérialisation des inégalités ne reflète pas nécessairement le degré d’inégalités dans une société. Au-delà de ces questions d’ordre méthodologique, c’est plus largement notre vision des types d’organisation sociale qui doit être renouvelée. La majeure partie de la littérature archéologique dévolue à la question des inégalités repose sur un modèle évolutionniste implicite. Chaque chercheur est tenté de voir dans sa période de spécialisation les signes décisifs menant à l’émergence ou au développement des sociétés inégalitaires. Tout se passe comme si le bénéfice des recherches récentes se résumait à avoir repoussé la frontière entre sociétés égalitaires et sociétés inégalitaires un peu plus loin dans le temps, la déplaçant du tournant de la néolithisation au Paléolithique récent, voire au Paléolithique moyen. À partir des études de cas publiées ces vingt dernières années en archéologie, je propose une revue critique des proxies employés pour ce faire, dans l’optique de contribuer à une discussion méthodologique plus vaste.},

 abstract = {Abstract
Strontium isotope ratios in human teeth from the three Swedish prehistoric Stone Age hunter-fisher-gathering societies Norje Sunnansund (Maglemose), Skateholm (Ertebølle) and Västerbjers (Pitted Ware Culture) were analysed with laser ablation to produce data on both individual movement patterns and societal mobility trends. The analyses of teeth from both Skateholm and Västerbjers displayed homogeneous ratios and corresponding mobility patterns, while the data from Norje Sunnansund showed larger variances with heterogenous strontium ratios and varied inter-individual mobility patterns. Correlation with the bioavailable baseline suggests that the size of the geographical areas, where human strontium ratios could have originated, was roughly comparable for all three sites. The teeth measurements were reflected within a 50-km radius of the surrounding landscape and the 25–75% data quartile matched with distances between 3 and 30 km from the sites, suggesting limited mobility ranges among aquatically dependent foragers from southernmost Sweden. By applying ethnographic analogies and site-specific contextual inferences, the results suggest that mobility ranges at Norje Sunnansund were likely not delimited by neighbouring group territories. This changed over time and an increasing territorialisation of the landscape may have influenced movement patterns and caused restrictions to the foraging activities at both Skateholm and Västerbjers.},

 abstract = {Flavor perception has several characteristics: (1) smell is a key part, but there is little awareness of its role; (2) central interactions occur between smell, taste, and somatosensation; (3) flavor is localized to the mouth; (4) discontinuities in odorant delivery are not noticed; and (5) there is limited access to some parts. Together, these suggest flavor is partially holistic, with odor and taste forming a common sensory channel in the mouth. One reason for this mode of perception is food choice. Flavor memories can support the identification of safe and nutritious food via: (1) recovery of the flavor percept—thus including taste (and somatosensory) experiences—via sniffing; (2) visual priming of flavor expectancies; and (3) affective reaction to flavor, reflecting the consequences of previous bouts of ingestion (e.g., sickness). These allow food acceptability to be assessed prior to ingestion, as well as supporting the expectancies to detect adulterated food.},

According to one important and influential research program, the basic (fundamental and discrete) emotions can be identified by their possession of a biologically based unique and universally recognized facial signal. To the classic set of six such emotions, researchers recently advanced 12 new candidates, which were examined in the present study with a standard free-labeling procedure in three samples: English-speaking Americans (<i>n</i> = 200), Mandarin-speaking Chinese (<i>n</i> = 101), and Malayalam-speaking Indians (<i>n</i> = 200). In the three samples, respectively, a majority of respondents chose the predicted label for only one, one, and none of the 12 faces. That is, a majority of respondents failed to choose the predicted label for 11 of the 12 faces in the English-speaking (proportion of respondents range for the 11: .04 to .45) and Mandarin-speaking (proportion of respondents range for the 11: .00 to .44) samples; a majority of respondents failed to choose the predicted label for any of the 12 faces in the Malayalam-speaking sample (proportion of respondents range: .00 to .42). The modal choice in the three samples was the predicted label for five, six, and one, respectively, of the 12 faces. "Recognition" of the predicted emotion was negligible (&lt; 15% of respondents) for five, eight (two of which were modal), and 10, respectively, of the 12 faces.

 abstract = {There is debate about the metabolic impact of sugar-sweetened beverages. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ad lib consumption of glucose (Gluc) or high-fructose (HiFruc) syrups improves glucose tolerance in mice. We provided C57BL/6 mice with a control (chow and water) or experimental (chow, water and sugar solution) diet across two consecutive 28-day exposure periods, and monitored changes in body composition, glucose tolerance, cephalic-phase insulin release (CPIR) and insulin sensitivity. The sugar solutions contained 11% concentrations of Gluc or HiFruc syrup; these syrups were derived from either corn starch or cellulose. In Experiment 1, consumption of the Gluc diets reliably enhanced glucose tolerance, while consumption of the HiFruc diets did not. Mice on the Gluc diets exhibited higher CPIR (relative to baseline) by the end of exposure period 1, whereas mice on the control and HiFruc diets did not do so until the end of exposure period 2. Mice on the Gluc diets also exhibited higher insulin sensitivity than control mice at the end of exposure period 2, while mice on the HiFruc diets did not. In Experiment 2, we repeated the previous experiment, but limited testing to the corn-based Gluc and HiFruc syrups. We found, once again, that consumption of the Gluc (but not the HiFruc) diet enhanced glucose tolerance, in part by increasing CPIR and insulin sensitivity. These results show that mice can adapt metabolically to high glucose diets, and that this adaptation process involves upregulating at least two components of the insulin response system.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiome is a crucial element that facilitates a host's adaptation to a changing environment. Compared to the western honeybee <i>Apis mellifera</i>, the Asian honeybee, <i>Apis cerana</i> populations across its natural range remain mostly semi-feral and are less affected by bee management, which provides a good system to investigate how gut microbiota evolve under environmental heterogeneity on large geographic scales. We compared and analyzed the gut microbiomes of 99 Asian honeybees, from genetically diverged populations covering 13 provinces across China. Bacterial composition varied significantly across populations at phylotype, sequence-discrete population (SDP), and strain levels, but with extensive overlaps, indicating that the diversity of microbial community among <i>A. cerana</i> populations is driven by nestedness. Pollen diets were significantly correlated with both the composition and function of the gut microbiome. Core bacteria, <i>Gilliamella</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> Firm-5, showed antagonistic turnovers and contributed to the enrichment in carbohydrate transport and metabolism. By feeding and inoculation bioassays, we confirmed that the variations in pollen polysaccharide composition contributed to the trade-off of these core bacteria. Progressive change, i.e., nestedness, is the foundation of gut microbiome evolution among the Asian honeybee. Such a transition during the co-diversification of gut microbiomes is affected by environmental factors, diets in general, and pollen polysaccharides in particular.},

 abstract = {Abstract Musk deer are famous for their secretion of musk; however, the scale of artificial breeding of musk deer is limited. Considering the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiota, there is a need to study the gut microbiota of Siberian musk deer (SMD). Quantitative PCR analysis and high-throughput sequencing were used to show the differences in gut microbial communities and functions between SMD and forest musk deer (FMD). The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly higher in SMD than in FMD, with a corresponding decrease in Bacteroidetes, and showed significant seasonal variation. The gut microbiome of FMD has enriched activity for carbohydrate metabolism, while in SMD, amino acids and energy metabolism was higher. The key enzymatic reactions were related to pyruvate metabolism in SMD; however, in FMD, enzymes that digest cellulose (EC:3.2.1.21, EC:3.2.1.4.) were more abundant, and these were related to the living environment and feeding habits. This indicates that FMD and SMD have significant differences in their microbial communities and functions. Furthermore, antibiotic resistances were identified and significantly different in gut microbes of SMD and FMD. For SMD, seasonal variations alter microbial communities and function. The key enzymes of the short-chain fatty acids (EC:1.3.1.44, EC:6.4.1.2) were significantly different, with higher relative abundance in winter—a mechanism of natural selection and environmental adaptation. This study is the first to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota of SMD and can be used to develop or modify conservation and husbandry strategies for musk deer, to improve their productivity.Graphical abstractKey points• Significant differences in microbial communities and their function between FMD and SMD.• The energy metabolism and the relative abundance of Firmicutes were significantly higher in SMD.• Seasonal variations alter microbial function in SMD, carbohydrate metabolism was higher in summer.},

 abstract = {The evolution of basic color terms in language is claimed to be stimulated by technological development, involving technological control of color or exposure to artificially colored objects. Accordingly, technologically "simple" non-industrialized societies are expected to have poor lexicalization of color, i.e., only rudimentary lexica of 2, 3 or 4 basic color terms, with unnamed gaps in the color space. While it may indeed be the case that technology stimulates lexical growth of color terms, it is sometimes considered a sine qua non for color salience and lexicalization. We provide novel evidence that this overlooks the role of the natural environment, and people's engagement with the environment, in the evolution of color vocabulary. We introduce the Maniq-nomadic hunter-gatherers with no color technology, but who have a basic color lexicon of 6 or 7 terms, thus of the same order as large languages like Vietnamese and Hausa, and who routinely talk about color. We examine color language in Maniq and compare it to available data in other languages to demonstrate it has remarkably high consensual color term usage, on a par with English, and high coding efficiency. This shows colors can matter even for non-industrialized societies, suggesting technology is not necessary for color language. Instead, factors such as perceptual prominence of color in natural environments, its practical usefulness across communicative contexts, and symbolic importance can all stimulate elaboration of color language.},

 abstract = {The earliest hominin archaeological sites preserve a record of stone tools used for cutting and pounding. Traditionally, sharp-edged flakes were seen as the primary means by which our earliest ancestors interacted with the world. The importance of pounding tools is increasingly apparent. In some cases, they have been compared with stone hammers and anvils used by chimpanzees for nut-cracking. However, there has been little focus on providing a robust descriptive and quantitative characterization of chimpanzee stone tools, allowing for meaningful comparisons between chimpanzee groups and with archaeological artefacts. Here we apply a primate archaeological approach to characterize the range of chimpanzee nut-cracking stone tools from Djouroutou in the Taï National Park. By combining a techno-typological analysis, and two- and three-dimensional measures of damage, we identify clear differences in the location and extent of damage between nut-cracking hammerstones and anvils used at Djouroutou and when compared with other wild chimpanzee populations. Furthermore, we discuss these results in relation to interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene percussive technology. We highlight potential difficulties in identifying the underlying function of percussive artefacts based on morphological or techno-typological attributes alone. The material record from Djouroutou represents an important new datum of chimpanzee regional and material culture.},

 abstract = {It has been proposed that humans' exceptional locomotor endurance evolved partly with foraging in hot open habitats and subsequently about 2 million years ago with persistence hunting, for which endurance running was instrumental. However, persistence hunting by walking, if successful, could select for locomotor endurance even before the emergence of any running-related traits in human evolution. Using a heat exchange model validated here in 73 humans and 55 ungulates, we simulated persistence hunts for prey of three sizes (100, 250, and 400 kg) and three sweating capacities (nonsweating, low, high) at 6237 combinations of hunter's velocity (1-5 m s<sup>-1</sup>, intermittent), air temperature (25-45 °C), relative humidity (30-90%), and start time (8:00-16:00). Our simulations predicted that walking would be successful in persistence hunting of low- and nonsweating prey, especially under hot and humid conditions. However, simulated persistence hunts by walking yielded a 30-74% lower success rate than hunts by running or intermittent running. In addition, despite requiring 10-30% less energy, successful simulated persistence hunts by walking were twice as long and resulted in greater exhaustion of the hunter than hunts by running and intermittent running. These shortcomings of pursuit by walking compared to running identified in our simulations could explain why there is only a single direct description of persistence hunting by walking among modern hunter-gatherers. Nevertheless, walking down prey could be a viable option for hominins who did not possess the endurance-running phenotype of the proposed first persistence hunter, Homo erectus. Our simulation results suggest that persistence hunting could select for both long-distance walking and endurance running and contribute to the evolution of locomotor endurance seen in modern humans.},

 abstract = {Stone tool backing repeatedly occurred on several continents throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene. Yet, any potential utilitarian advantages or disadvantages of backed stone tools relative to non-backed tools has been experimentally under-explored. Modern engineering experiments involving adhesion mechanics suggest an inverse relationship between surface area and the strength of a bond, especially on heterogeneous surfaces like stone. Some stone flakes, especially those with longer edges, may have been backed to make them easier to hold and safer to use. Further, Stone Age humans hafted both backed and un-backed tools for millennia in many parts of the world, suggesting effective hafting could occur with or without backing. Backing itself is a relatively simple technique providing toolmakers with an easy way to shape stone flakes. Some archaeologists have even hypothesized backed tool shaping was an end to communicate social information via stone symbols. This is the first pilot in a series of experiments testing a straightforward null and alternative hypothesis assessing the relationship between backing and adhesion and shaft damage with respect to projectile weaponry. Overall, our experimental results suggested two central conclusions with respect to backing. First, backing does not appear to improve adhesion but instead significantly worsens it. Second, laterally backed tools seem to increase the chances of shaft splitting relative to laterally hafted non-backed tools. Assuming for a moment that our results are supported by our future experimental research, our findings suggest that factors other than increased adhesion, such as intentional ‘failure,’ drift, or non-functional bias during social signaling or symbolic communication events, may have been responsible for the adoption and transmission of backed tools.},

Evidence from the archaeological record and contemporary human entanglements with meat are discussed across evolutionary, geologic, geographic, and biosocial scales to examine cellular agriculture as the evolution of human diet in the Anthropocene. Without critical attention to uncertainties inherent to interpreting the fossil record, moments in prehistory are woven into a timeline, creating a narrative of technological innovation in the diet that evolves toward the present. This primordial view of meat-eating and its intersection with technology struggles to avoid an essentialist view of the past and a teleological view of the present, but also impacts how we imagine our future, limiting critical examination of the future human diet.},

 abstract = {Intergroup and long-distance relationships are both central features of human social life, but because intergroup relationships are emphasized in the literature, long-distance relationships are often overlooked. Here, we make the case that intergroup and long-distance relationships should be studied as distinct, albeit related, features of human sociality. First, we review the functions of both kinds of relationship: while both can be conduits for difficult-to-access resources, intergroup relationships can reduce intergroup conflict whereas long-distance relationships are especially effective at buffering widespread resource shortfalls. Second, to illustrate the importance of distinguishing the two relationship types, we present a case study from rural Bolivia. Combining ethnography and two different experimental techniques, we find that the importance of intergroup relationships—and the salience of group membership itself—varies across populations and across methods. Although ethnography revealed that participants often rely on long-distance relationships for resource access, we were unable to capture participant preferences for these relationships with a forced-choice technique. Taken together, our review and empirical data highlight that (1) intergroup and long-distance relationships can have different functions and can be more or less important in different contexts and (2) validating experimental field data with ethnography is crucial for work on human sociality. We close by outlining future directions for research on long-distance relationships in humans.},

Hunters often gift game meat to their friends or family in return for reciprocation or other social benefits. We used interviews to assess how hunters in an Amazonian Indigenous community navigate the economic, subsistence, and social aspects of hunting. We found that hunters typically sell the most valuable and preferred species whole, except for the head, gift better cuts of less-preferred species, and consume the lowest quality portions of non-preferred species. We conclude that hunters use species and portions of carcasses differentially to maximize profit and food security and fit the social norms of the community. Understanding the social systems surrounding wild game use in rural Amazonian communities provides insight into how the loss of wild mammals could influence food security and social relationships.},

From these mechanisms and processes, we mainly zoom in on symbiosis and we investigate how it underlies the rise of (1) human, plant, animal, and machine interactions typical of agriculture, animal husbandry, farming, and industrialization; (2) diet-microbiome relationships; and (3) host-virome and other pathogen interactions that underlie human health and disease. We demonstrate that reticulate evolution necessitates an understanding of behavioral and cultural evolution at a community level, where reticulate causal processes underlie the rise of synergistic organizational traits.},

It presents an extensive analysis of postcolonial music education in relation to globalization, westernization, cosmopolitanism, and nationalization. It makes contributions to the theoretical arguments that can be used to interpret the impact of China on the previously Western orientation of education in Hong Kong. This book also explicitly problematizes the theoretical foundations of mandated policies such as play-based learning and moral education in early childhood through music in Hong Kong and across the globe. The analysis of historical context, political influences, and education ideologies in Hong Kong’s early childhood education subsystem provides fertile ground for a thorough understanding of the meaning and implications of globalization in education at multiple levels. Many empirical-based discussions in this book reflect the ideologies, trends, and practices of music education globally. Framed by Bandura’s social cognitive theory, the empirical studies discussed in the book explore the self-efficacy and practices of education leaders and teachers, reflecting the contemporary challenges of music education. Ultimately, it makes a vital contribution by offering a new conceptual model of music teacher education within a globally resonant framework. Fanny M. Y.

Som den hollandske fysiolog og materialist Jacob Moleschott skrev i værket Kreislauf des Lebens fra 1852: Menneskets ekskrementer nærer planten. Planten omdanner luften til stof og nærer dyret. Kødædende dyr spiser planteædere, for derefter selv at gå til grunde og sprede nyt spirende liv i planteverdenen. Denne materielle udveksling er blevet kaldt stofskifte. Vi bør med rette benævne dette ord med en vis ærbødighed. For ligesom udveksling er handlens sjæl, er den evige cirkulation af stof selve verdens sjæl. (Citeret fra Schmidt 1971, 87) Lort, ligesom livet, er stof, der er skiftet. Lort er transformation, både nedbrydning og genskabelse. Lort er bogstaveligt talt levende, det indeholder trillioner af mikroorganismer, der tilsammen udgør små flerartede økosystemer. Lort er også toksisk og kan sprede sygdomme; i det store kredsløb er den enes lort både potentielt den andens død såvel som brød. Lort er livgivende, men kan også have for meget eller det forkerte liv, hvis det optræder det forkerte sted. Det er intimt, forbudt, hverdagsagtigt, og tabuiseret i højeste potens. Lort bevæger sig på tværs af grænser – liv og død, det private og det offentlige, afsky og fascination, krop og omverden. Det løber, bogstaveligt og metaforisk, som en flod under vores civilisation, allestedsnærværende, men ofte gjort usynligt. Lort er med andre ord prægnant, fyldt med liv, død og energi, på tværs af det materielle og det symbolske.},

This article aims to provide data that helps characterise the puma’s taphonomic signature and add information about its diet. We present and discuss the results of the analysis of bones recovered in puma scats collected in Sierra de las Quijadas National Park, province of San Luis, Argentina. This analysis indicates a high taxonomic richness dominated by medium-sized taxa, particularly Dolichotis. The skeletal remains are highly fragmented, most show gastric digestion of varying intensity, while a low percentage exhibit tooth marks. This study is helpful for its application in the Americas, where puma has a wide distribution. It can also be relevant as an analog in other parts of the world where big cats have lived in the past.},

 abstract = {Human carnivory is atypical among primates. Unlike chimpanzees and bonobos, who are known to hunt smaller monkeys and eat them immediately, human foragers often cooperate to kill large animals and transport them to a safe location to be shared. While it is known that meat became an important part of the hominin diet around 2.6-2 Mya, whether intense cooperation and food sharing developed in conjunction with the regular intake of meat remains unresolved. A widespread assumption is that early hominins acquired animal protein through klepto-parasitism at felid kills. This should be testable by detecting felid-specific bone modifications and tooth marks on carcasses consumed by hominins. Here, deep learning (DL) computer vision was used to identify agency through the analysis of tooth pits and scores on bones recovered from the Early Pleistocene site of DS (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). We present the first objective evidence of primary access to meat by hominins 1.8 Mya by showing that the most common securely detectable bone-modifying fissipeds at the site were hyenas. The absence of felid modifications in most of the carcasses analyzed indicates that hominins were the primary consumers of most animals accumulated at the site, with hyenas intervening at the post-depositional stage. This underscores the role of hominins as a prominent part of the early Pleistocene African carnivore guild. It also stresses the major (and potentially regular) role that meat played in the diet that configured the emergence of early <i>Homo</i>.},

 abstract = {FTIR spectroscopy has played an important role in attempts to understand the use of fire in prehistory, particularly through the identification of heated bone. The presence of the OH libration band at ca. 630 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of archaeological bone has been assumed to be indicative of bone that has been altered by fire. However, no definitive research has explored what the effects of heating variables may be on the appearance of this band. This paper studied the nature of heated bone, with the understanding that the FTIR 630 cm−1 band is the result of the formation of pure hydroxyapatite through the loss of carbonates from the bone mineral, carbonated hydroxyapatite. A set of experiments was designed to determine the impact of temperature, duration, and bone size on the appearance of the 630 cm−1 band: using samples of cortical bone from micro- and macrofauna, heating experiments were carried out to explore the appearance and change in the OH libration band. Results showed that this band appeared in bone samples heated to temperatures above 537 °C, and demonstrated that microfauna were more sensitive to thermal alteration. Bones heated in reducing conditions and bones which are fluoridated do not express the 630 cm−1 OH libration band, therefore FTIR is underrepresenting burning in the archaeological record. A quantitative method “HATI” was created to objectively assess whether a bone sample has been heated above 537 °C.},

Among social influences, those by external authorities (e.g. educational, cultural, religious, political, administrative, etc.) are particularly important owing to their potential reach and power. To better understand the effects of 'soft' power of authorities we develop a unifying theoretical framework integrating material, cognitive and social forces controlling the joint dynamics of individual actions and beliefs. We apply our approach to three different phenomena: evolution of food sharing in small-scale societies, participation in political protests and effects of priming social identity in behavioural experiments. For each of these applications, we show that our approach leads to different (or simpler) explanations of human behaviour than alternatives. We highlight the type of measurements which can be helpful in developing practical applications of our approach. We identify and explicitly characterise the degree of mismatch between individual actions and attitudes. We assert that the effects of external authorities, of changing beliefs and of differences between people must be studied empirically, included in mathematical models, and accounted for when developing different policies aiming to modify or sustain human behaviour.},

 abstract = {Paleolithic archaeologists often rely on cave and rockshelter sites with rich occupation levels to explore hominin behavior and settlement patterns. However, a closer look into regional occupation data may reveal an uneven distribution of sites and the presence of occupational hiatuses or low-density occupation horizons that often remain understudied. In contrast to this trend, this paper focuses on low-density occupation data to explore regional settlement patterns, using the rich and well-studied Paleolithic record of the Swabian Jura, Germany, as a case study. In this regard, we employ a geoarchaeological approach based on micromorphology to investigate the formation processes of two low-density occupation sites, Schafstall II and Fetzershaldenhöhle, and compare their formation history with the geogenic sequence from Lindenhöhle. We demonstrate that the investigated sites have comparable formation processes, despite their differences in chronology and context. We argue that humans used Schafstall II and Fetzershaldenhöhle for short-term activities, while the sites mostly served as carnivore activity areas, emphasizing the importance of fauna in the accumulation of thick sedimentary sequences. In addition, our findings corroborate the regional climatic record and provide novel insights into the geomorphological history of the less studied Lauchert Valley, where Schafstall II is located. By comparing our results with data from intensively occupied caves in the Swabian Jura, we provide broader implications for the settlement patterns of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. We conclude with methodological suggestions for investigating sites in hunter-gatherer contexts combining a distributional and a site-specific approach.},

 abstract = {Hearths exposed on the eroding surface of the Lake Mungo lunette include the remains of ovens lined or capped with heat retainers, discrete patches of cemented and organic rich sediment, and discrete clusters of burned bone. Microstratigraphic investigation of four late Pleistocene hearths was undertaken using thin section microscopy and mineral mapping, involving Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (QEM-EDS). This provided the basis for interpreting the activities represented by the hearths and for assessing the impact of depositional and post-depositional processes on their preservation. Although thin section microscopy proved more useful than QEM-EDS for this purpose. Microstratigraphic study of baked sediment hearths is critical to understanding the cooking and food processing activities they represent, and for documenting the impact of depositional, post-depositional and post-exposure processes on the way they are preserved.},

                The effect of lifelong dynamics on host longevity of the gut microbiome is largely unknown. Herein, we analyzed the longitudinal fecal samples of seven sibling mice across their lifespan from birth to natural death, spanning over 1,000 days of age, and maintained them under controlled environmental and dietary conditions. Our 16S-rRNA sequencing analysis revealed 38 common “life-core” bacterial species/OTUs (operational taxonomic units) detected in ≥80% of all samples collected across the lifespan of individual mice. Despite the shared genetic background and dietary habits, the gut microbiome structure significantly diversified with age and among individuals. We found a strong positive correlation between longevity and the alpha diversity in middle age (500-700 days) and negative correlation in old age (>800 days). Furthermore, host longevity was significantly associated with the abundance of 17 bacterial species/OTUs, most of which were “life-core” species. Our data suggest that temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome are strongly linked to host longevity.},

 abstract = {The hunting activities of Neanderthals inhabiting the European Lowlands during the Weichsel glaciation are poorly understood due to the scarcity of faunal remains. This work concerns the puzzling accumulation of mammalian remains at the Middle Palaeolithic site Haller Av. in Wrocław, southwestern Poland. The site yielded lithic artifacts in two levels and numerous bone remains typical for steppe-tundra fauna, dominated by steppe bison (Bison priscus). As the site was transformed by fluvial processes, the question arose whether the accumulation of faunal bones was the result of human activity. To resolve this question, we used a multiproxy approach, including spatial analysis with GIS, as well as taphonomic and paleozoological analyses. It was found that the accumulation of bone remains was multi-stage and involved a large area. Only the bison remains were spatially correlated with the traces of human activity. In our opinion, these data indicate the presence of a hunting site of monospecific fauna, demonstrating the profound knowledge of Neanderthals about the ecosystem of which they were a part.},

 abstract = {We investigated the communicative gestures used by chimpanzee and human infants. In contrast to previous studies, we compared the species at the same age (12–14 months) and used multiple groups living in diverse socioecological settings for both species. We recorded gestures produced by infants and those produce by others and directed toward infants. We classified the gestures into the following types: human-usual, chimpanzee-usual, and species-common; and searched for within species and between species differences. We found no significant differences between groups or species in overall rates of infant-produced or infant-received gestures, suggesting that all of these infants produced and received gestures at similar levels. We did find significant differences, however, when we considered the three types of gesture. Chimpanzee infants produced significantly higher rates of chimpanzee-usual gestures, and human infants produced significantly higher rates of human-usual gestures, but there was no significant species difference in the species-common gestures. Reports of species differences in gesturing in young infants, therefore, could be influenced by investigators’ choice of gesture type. Interestingly, we found that 1-year-old infants produced the gesture of “hold mutual gaze" and that the chimpanzee infants had a significantly higher rate than the human infants. We did not find strong evidence that the specific types of gestural environment experienced by young infants influenced the types of gestures that infants produce. We suggest that at this point in development (before human infants use lots of speech), nonverbal communicative gestures may be equally important for human and chimpanzee infants.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe relationship between the gut microbiome and diet has been the focus of numerous recent studies. Such studies aim to characterize the impact of diet on the composition of the microbiome, as well as the microbiome’s ability to utilize various compounds in the diet and produce metabolites that may be beneficial for the host. Consumption of dietary fibers (DFs)—polysaccharides that cannot be broken down by the host’s endogenous enzymes and are degraded primarily by members of the microbiome—is known to have a profound effect on the microbiome. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of microbiome compositional and functional shifts in response to the consumption of specific DFs is still lacking.ResultsHere, we introduce a computational framework, coupling metagenomic sequencing with careful annotation of polysaccharide degrading enzymes and DF structures, for inferring the metabolic ability of a given microbiome sample to utilize a broad catalog of DFs. We demonstrate that the inferred fiber degradation profile (IFDP) generated by our framework accurately reflects the dietary habits of various hosts across four independent datasets. We further demonstrate that IFDPs are more tightly linked to the host diet than commonly used taxonomic and functional microbiome-based profiles. Finally, applying our framework to a set of ~700 metagenomes that represents large human population cohorts from 9 different countries, we highlight intriguing global patterns linking DF consumption habits with microbiome capacities.ConclusionsCombined, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept for the use of DF-specific analysis for providing important complementary information for better understanding the relationship between dietary habits and the gut microbiome.},

 abstract = {Abstract According to Mary Midgley, philosophy is like plumbing: like the invisible entrails of an elaborate plumbing system, philosophical ideas respond to basic needs that are fundamental to human life. Melioristic projects in philosophy attempt to fix or reroute this plumbing. An obstacle to melioristic projects is that the sheer familiarity of the underlying philosophical ideas renders the plumbing invisible. Philosophical genealogies aim to overcome this by looking at the origins of our current concepts. We discuss philosophical concepts developed in Indigenous cultures as a source of inspiration for melioristic genealogy. Examining the philosophical concepts of these communities is useful because it gives us a better idea of the range of ethical, political, and metaphysical approaches that exist in the world. Members of western societies do not get a clear view of this range, in part because living in large groups presents its own constraints and challenges, which limit philosophical options. We argue that features of Indigenous philosophies, such as egalitarianism and care for one's natural environment, are not inevitable byproducts of Native material conditions and lifestyles, but that they are deliberate forms of conceptual engineering. We propose that comparative philosophy is an integral part of the genealogical project.},

To evaluate if and how selection for running influenced the evolution of the human foot, we use functional, comparative, and fossil evidence to assess the three major biomechanical challenges posed to the foot by running versus walking: impact, elastic energy storage, and propulsion. Although human feet unambiguously evolved numerous adaptations for walking, the human foot also has several key derived adaptations for running, especially to store and release elastic energy but also to cope with impacts and to sustain repeated, high, rapid propulsive forces. In addition, some features of the human foot traditionally considered adaptations for walking, especially the longitudinal arch, may play a less important role in walking than commonly assumed but are essential for running. In order to understand the anatomy and function of the unique human foot, it is necessary to consider both walking and running.},

The practices of Hadrami descendant in kampong (hamlet) Arab Surabaya closely related to their respect toward local inhabitants. It is usually expressed through their language and its manners. Besides, their interaction with local people imposes them to switch speaking in Indonesian, Javanese, and Maduranese. They used two languages (bilingualism) or more (multilingualism) in an everyday conversation. Interestingly, they attempt to practice and maintain Arabic to show their identity as holy people relate to their claim that they trace their descent to the Prophet Muhammad.

The researcher uses archival or documentary method to search the various languages and ethnography method to describe and explore daily language of native.  This paper reveals that the daily practices of Arabic code emphasize their identity individually or socially and defend their language in social multilingualism. In addition, fushah language or high level of Arabic language is used only in formal situation. However, most of them is using low level of Arabic language called ‘Amiyah in non formal situation both in public or private sphere.},

 abstract = {Here, we present a thorough taphonomic analysis of the 1.84 million-year-old site of Phillip Tobias Korongo (PTK), Bed I, Olduvai Gorge. PTK is one of the new archaeological sites documented on the FLK Zinj paleolandscape, in which FLK 22 level was deposited and covered by Tuff IC. Therefore, PTK is pene-contemporary with these sites: FLK Zinj, DS, AMK and AGS. The occurrence of these sites within a thin clay unit of ∼20 cm, occupying not only the same vertically discrete stratigraphic unit, but also the same paleosurface, with an exceptional preservation of the archaeological record in its primary depositional locus, constitutes a unique opportunity to explore early hominin behavioral diversity at the most limited geochronological scale possible. The Olduvai Bed I sites have been the core of behavioral modelling for the past half a century, and the newly discovered sites, excavated with 21st century technology, will increase significantly our understanding of early human adaptive patterns. Here, we present PTK as another assemblage where faunal resources were acquired by hominins prior to any carnivore, and where stone-tool assisted bulk defleshing was carried out. The abundance of juvenile individuals extends our understanding, as in Kanjera (Kenya), about the hunting skills of early Homo sensu lato. The increasing number of sites, where bulk defleshing of small and medium-sized carcasses took place is underscoring the importance of meat in the diets of some of the early hominins, and their patterned use of the space for food processing and consumption. The patterning emerging has a profound importance for the evolution of some of the features that have traditionally been used to identify the behavior of the genus Homo.},

 abstract = {Packaging and label design are crucial in facilitating the perception of brand premiumness. However, we know relatively little about how common design characteristics used in a product’ packaging affect consumers' perception of premiumness. Related research suggests that consumers may associate some features, such as symmetry, with premiumness, given their quality connotations. In this article, we report an online study (n = 741) designed to evaluate the influence of curvature (round vs. angular), symmetry (symmetrical vs. asymmetrical), and mark (black vs. no fill) on consumers' premiumness perceptions, across four different food product categories (chocolate, coffee, jam, and ice-cream), and two price conditions. Overall, we find a significant positive effect of symmetry, and a significant effect of mark on all except one product category. The effect of mark and curvature on consumers’ premiumness perception appeared to be affected more by context and product-category. Consistent with evolutionary theory, the results provide evidence for the hypothesis that symmetry is a key indicator of brand premiumness. This contributes to our understanding of the aesthetics of premium brands and suggests specific implications for practitioners.},

 abstract = {Humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans independently adapted to a wide range of geographic environments and their associated food odors. Using ancient DNA sequences, we explored the <i>in vitro</i> function of thirty odorant receptor genes in the genus <i>Homo</i>. Our extinct relatives had highly conserved olfactory receptor sequence, but humans did not. Variations in odorant receptor protein sequence and structure may have produced variation in odor detection and perception. Variants led to minimal changes in specificity but had more influence on functional sensitivity. The few Neanderthal variants disturbed function, whereas Denisovan variants increased sensitivity to sweet and sulfur odors. Geographic adaptations may have produced greater functional variation in our lineage, increasing our olfactory repertoire and expanding our adaptive capacity. Our survey of olfactory genes and odorant receptors suggests that our genus has a shared repertoire with possible local ecological adaptations.},

 abstract = {This research attempts to offer hermeneutics of reception by Hans Robert Jauss as an alternative to understanding the Quran. Starting from the concern of some contemporary Islamic thinkers about the limitations of the classical Quran in overcoming human problems that are always dynamic, hermeneutics has become a much-demanded approach. In addition, the methodological principle of classical interpretation tends to forget the role of human participation in interpreting the Quran. Nevertheless, the practice of the reception approach has stagnated in the study of the living Quran, which only performs a simple analysis of a tradition into three reception typologies: exegesis, functional, and aesthetic, without any more profound critique. This article aims to describe Hans Robert Jauss’ hermeneutics of reception as a relevant offer to fill the void of Quranic studies from the reader's perspective. For this reason, this article is compiled using qualitative methods based on literature studies so that essential aspects that need to be considered as material for hermeneutics of reception analysis can be well elaborated. There are three crucial aspects to the hermeneutics of reception; the Horizon of expectations, the three levels of reading, and the validity of the aesthetic experience.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Strain-level diversity is widespread among bacterial species and can expand the functional potential of natural microbial communities. However, to what extent communities undergo consistent shifts in strain composition in response to environmental/host changes is less well understood. Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to compare the gut microbiota of two behavioral states of the Western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ), namely nurse and forager bees. While their gut microbiota is composed of the same bacterial species, we detected consistent changes in strain-level composition between nurses and foragers. Single nucleotide variant profiles of predominant bacterial species clustered by behavioral state. Moreover, we identified strain-specific gene content related to nutrient utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and cell-cell interactions specifically associated with the two behavioral states. Our findings show that strain-level diversity in host-associated communities can undergo consistent changes in response to host behavioral changes modulating the functional potential of the community. },

 abstract = {The archaeological record of the Lagar Velho rock shelter (Lapedo Valley, Leiria, Portugal) bears testimony to several significant Upper Palaeolithic occupations, most notably the Lapedo Child burial (LV1) dating from the Gravettian. Excavations undertaken at the site since 2018 have seen the recovery of a large quantity of coprolites, above all in layer 143 (c. 29 ka cal BP). The study of these fossilized remains points to the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) as the main coprogenic agent and provides the first descriptions of these avian coprolites in archaeological assemblages. The analyses reported involved the comparison of the coprogenic samples with modern bearded vulture scats. A new morphotype is proposed for discriminating the faeces of this avian scavenger based on (1) macroscopic analyses, (2) morphometric comparisons with other fossil and modern scats and (3) their mineralogical and elemental composition. Among the criteria proposed here to identify the coprolites of the bearded vulture are their cylindrical shape, diameter, pointed extremities and homogeneous porous texture, as well as their massive internal texture, hard consistency and total absence of bone inclusions (attributable in all likelihood to a high digastric juice acidity capable of dissolving bones). Our results indicate that, as well as being used by humans for short-term stays, the Lagar Velho rock shelter was used by the bearded vulture as a nesting site. We provide new evidence from Iberia of the activity of this avian scavenger as a bone accumulator in archaeological sites.},

 abstract = {Scholars have long debated whether the relationship between Islam and Javanese culture should be considered syncretism or inculturation. This article analyzes Javanese literature to discuss post-syncretism in Islamic studies. It argues that Javanese literature exemplifies the vernacularization of Islamic theology into Javanese language and discourse. It describes how Islamic theology was used in eight Javanese texts at different historical points in the 19th Century. The leading Islamic theological terms (God, angels, Al-Qur’an, Prophet, and the Last Day) have consistent meanings in the Javanese text. Differences were only found in spelling, pronunciation, and written script that converted Arabic to Javanese and Pegon. Vernacularization functions as a tool for transmitting knowledge while the substance, meaning, and content remain unchanged. Therefore, there is no evidence of syncretism in using these terms. Syncretism may have operated in Javanese culture (e.g., Javanese Islamic rituals), but it does not appear that syncretism has penetrated the realm of theology. Accordingly, future studies on local Islam should explore discursive traditions and how knowledge has been generated alongside the process of Islamization. [Para sarjana telah berdebat lama apakah hubungan Islam dan budaya Jawa, sebaiknya berupa sinkretisme atau inkulturasi. Artikel ini membahas literatur Jawa untuk mendiskusikan post-sinkretisme dalam kajian Islam. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa literatur Jawa mencerminkan penyebaran teologi Islam melalui bahasa Jawa dan wacananya. Artikel ini menunjukkan teologi Islam dalam enam teks Jawa dengan penekanan historis yang berbeda pada abad 19. Istilah teologi penting seperti, Allah, malaikat, al-Qur’an, nabi dan kiamat, mempunyai makna yang tetap dalam teks Jawa. Perbedaan yang muncul hanya ejaan, pengucapan dan penulisan saat dialihkan dari bahasa Arab ke bahasa Jawa dan aksara pegon. Pribumisasi berfungsi sebagai alat transmisi pengetahuan, sedangkan substansi, makna dan kandungannya tidak berubah. Oleh karena itu tidak ada sinkretisme yang digunakan dalam pribumisasi ini. Sinkretisme mungkin berlangsung di wilayah budaya, tetapi tidak dalam konteks teologi. Dengan demikian, kajian ke depan tentang Islam lokal mengarah pada diskursif tradisi dan bagaimana pengetahuan berkembang seiring dengan proses islamisasi.]},

Some of the previous literature limited the object to the behavior of the Muslim community towards the ideology of the caliphate in the historical context and its relation to the modern state, neglecting the source of inspiration for the caliphate ideology as understood and perceived by figures of mass organization Indonesia. Therefore, using a phenomenological approach, the researchers attempt to fill the gap in this particular issue. This research was conducted in two cities in Indonesia, Aceh and West Java. This form of field study takes a phenomenological approach and thus is exploratory. Interviews and documentation have been used to collect data. This research found three main tendencies of Islamic mass organizations in Aceh and West Java in understanding the concept of the caliphate, textualist-substantive, contextualist-substantive, and ideological-political. Textualist-functionalists see the Islamic caliphate as mandatory, without having to change the ideology or identity of a country. Contextualist-Substantive argues that the Khilafah is a value that does not contradict with Pancasila's state ideology. Ideological and political Islamists believe that the fight to establish an Islamic State, or Daulah Islamiyyah Khilafah, is a necessity and even an obligation.},

 abstract = {Abstract    Daily light–dark cycles shape the circadian physiology and behaviour of nearly all organisms, with variation in circadian phenotypes having cascading effects on individual fitness, species interactions and species co‐evolution.   Recent evidence that circadian rhythms in host immunity and metabolism are synchronised by the gut microbiota suggest that the circadian dynamics of gut microbes are a crucial component of their function. However, there remains little knowledge or understanding of the diurnal dynamics of gut microbiomes in natural populations or the consequences for host physiology and ecology.   Here, we summarise the hallmarks of gut microbiota oscillations reported to date and the mechanisms by which they synchronise rhythms in host immunity and metabolism. We outline the consequences for diverse biological processes such as host pathogen susceptibility and seasonal switches in metabolism, and discuss how the breakdown of these circadian interactions, for example during senescence or because of light pollution, may affect wildlife infection risk and disease.   We also provide practical guidelines for the measurement of microbial oscillations in wildlife, highlighting that whilst faecal samples of wild animals are rarely available over a 24‐h period, characterising even parts of the gut microbial cycle can be informative.   An improved understanding of how gut microbial diurnal rhythms manifest in wildlife is essential to fully comprehend their role in shaping variation in host circadian phenotypes and the consequences for host physiology and ecology.

Abstract    Der Tag‐Nacht‐Zyklus prägt die zircadiane Physiologie und das tägliche Verhalten fast aller Organismen, mit weitreichenden Auswirkungen auf individuelle Fitness, Interaktionen zwischen Arten und ko‐evolutionäre Prozesse.   Laut jüngsten Erkenntnissen werden die zirkadianen Rhythmen des Immunsystems und des Stoffwechsels des Wirts durch die Darmmikrobiota synchronisiert, was darauf schließen lässt, dass die tageszeitliche Dynamik des wirtsassoziierten Mikrobioms ein wichtiger Faktor für dessen Funktion ist. Bislang gibt es jedoch nur wenig gesicherte Erkenntnisse über die tageszeitliche Dynamik von Darmmikrobiomen in Wildtierpopulationen und die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen für die Physiologie und Ökologie des Wirts.   Hier fassen wir die bisher bekannten Grundsätze der Oszillationen der Darmmikrobiota und die Mechanismen, über die sie die zirkadianen Rhythmen in Immunsystem und Stoffwechsel des Wirts synchronisieren, zusammen. Wir skizzieren die Folgen dieser zircadianen Rhythmen im Mikrobiom für verschiedene biologische Prozesse, wie die Anfälligkeit des Wirts für Krankheitserreger und saisonale Veränderungen im Stoffwechsel, und erörtern die potentiellen Folgen eines Zusammenbruch dieser zircadianen Interaktionen, zum Beispiel im Laufe des Alterungsprozesses oder als Folge von Lichtverschmutzung, auf Infektionsrisiko und Krankheiten bei Wildtieren.   Zuletzt stellen praktische Leitlinien für die Messung mikrobieller Oszillationen bei Wildtieren vor. Auch wenn Kotproben von Wildtieren selten über einen Zeitraum von 24 Stunden zur Verfügung stehen, möchten wir betonen, dass auch die Charakterisierung von Teilen des mikrobiellen Darmrhythmus zum Erkenntnisgewinn beitragen kann.   Ein besseres Verständnis darüber, wie sich mikrobielle Tagesrhythmen in Wildtieren manifestieren, ist unerlässlich um ihre Rolle für die Variation im circadianen Phänotyp des Wirts und dessen Auswirkungen auf die Physiologie und Ökologie des Wirts vollständig zu verstehen.   
Abstract    Los ritmos fisiológicos y comportamentales diarios de la mayoría de los organismos están gobernados por los ciclos diarios de luz‐oscuridad. A su vez, la variación en estos fenotipos circadianos tiene efectos sobre la eficacia biológica y, las interacciones entre especies y su co‐evolución.   Recientemente se ha observado que los ritmos circadianos en el sistema inmune y metabolismo de los individuos están sincronizados por oscilaciones diarias en su microbioma intestinal, lo cual sugiere un papel fundamental de estos últimos para el desarrollo de su función. Sin embargo, nuestro conocimiento de la dinámica diaria del microbioma intestinal en poblaciones naturales o de sus consecuencias para la fisiología y ecología de los huéspedes es limitado.   En este trabajo, resumimos los rasgos distintivos de las oscilaciones diarias del microbioma intestinal y los mecanismos a través de los cuales el microbioma intestinal sincroniza los ritmos de inmunidad y metabolismo del huésped. Además, resumimos las consecuencias de tal sincronización para diversos procesos biológicos, tales como la susceptibilidad a patógenos y los cambios estacionales en el metabolismo; y, discutimos cómo la ruptura de esta sincronización diaria, por ejemplo, a causa de la senescencia o de la contaminación lumínica, puede afectar al riesgo de infección y enfermedad de la fauna.   Por último, incluimos una guía práctica para medir las oscilaciones diarias en el microbioma intestinal de especies salvajes, remarcando que, aunque obtener muestras fecales de fauna en libertad durante un periodo de 24 horas es complicado, la caracterización parcial del ritmo circadiano del microbioma intestinal puede ser informativa.   Mejorar el conocimiento sobre el funcionamiento de los ritmos diurnos en el microbioma intestinal de la fauna salvaje es esencial para comprender su efecto sobre la variación natural en los ritmos circadianos de los huéspedes y, las consecuencias para su fisiología y ecología.   },

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examines changes in dental wear magnitude in the past ∼8000 years, i.e., since Mesolithic until the 19th century, in southwestern Iberia. Thus, it encompasses the transition from hunting-gathering to agro-pastoralism, and then to the industrialization of food production and pre-processing.
DESIGN: Dental wear magnitude was scored in a total of 191 individuals and 1557 teeth from Mesolithic (individuals=56; teeth=643), Neolithic (individuals=35; teeth=169), Chalcolithic (individuals =35; teeth=221), Modern Age (individuals=17; teeth=209), and Late Modern Age (individuals=48; teeth=315) samples originating in southwestern Iberia (i.e., present central and southern Portugal) and according to the 8 levels ordinal scale of Smith (1984).
RESULTS: Results show a general trend for decreased wear magnitude in these two major transitions and during this timespan (although the hunting-gathering - agro-pastoralism transition had larger impact). The only meaningful differences in wear rate were found between the Late Modern Age and all remaining samples.
CONCLUSION: Dental wear generally decreased during this timespan (although wear magnitude was less impacted by the industrialization of food production and pre-processing). Our results are consistent with studies documenting skull morphological gracilization associated with reduced masticatory demands due to the adoption of softer diets.},

 abstract = {In recent years, increased attention has been paid to traditional sports and games as useful phenomenon to understand cultural identities in African countries. With this re-evaluation, national and international institutions began to develop educational programs for the transmission and conservation of traditional games. However, due to limited empirical investigation of play activities in different subsistence groups in Africa, understanding of play as cultural phenomena still pays little attention to children and their roles in cultural generations. This limitation may lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of play and its transmission in different sociocultural contexts. Till now, anthropological studies focused on children and their development in non-western contexts highlighted the active roles children take in cultural generations through their participation in social activities. These studies emphasized the importance of understanding the diverse forms of children,s cultural learning in different sociocultural contexts, and this focus could also be applied to the study of play and its transmission in time and space.   This study investigates the daily play of children and its transformations across generations within a pastoralist Maasai society in Southern Kenya. Focal observation of the daily activities of 13 children (2 to 11 years old) has been conducted, and children,s daily play was documented considering their contents, locations and participants. In addition, 80 adults (40 females, 40 males) in the same area were interviewed about their playing experiences during childhood.   Findings of this study show, first, various play activities were continuously practiced by Maasai across generations during childhood. Second, children,s participation in play activities are usually only undertaken with peers, and without instructions or guidance from adults. Third, through daily play children continuously develop their intimate relationship with livestock and natural elements such as plants, insects and wild animals. Results from this study highlight that culturally significant play activities are still continuously practiced by young generations in societies where children continue their social activities whilst performing other roles. In these societies, instead of taking traditional sports and games as practices of the past, and incorporating them into the school curriculum, it is necessary to document the transformations of different local play activities in concurrent sociocultural contexts considering children,s social participation, their roles in culture generation, adult generations, play experience during childhood, and the features of learning in the targeted society. For doing so, further investigation of daily childhood experiences using ethnographic documentation is recommended.},

 abstract = {The late Early Pleistocene archaeological site of Fuente Nueva 3 (Orce, Guadix-Baza Depression, SE Spain), dated to ~1.4 Ma, provides evidence on the subsistence strategies of the first hominin population that dispersed in Western Europe. The site preserves Oldowan tool assemblages associated with abundant remains of large mammals. A small proportion of these remains show cut marks and percussion marks resulting from defleshing and bone fracturing, and a small proportion of bones also show tooth marks. Previous taphonomic studies of FN3 suggested that the hominins had secondary access to the prey leftovers abandoned by sabretooth cats and other primary predators. However, a recent analysis by Yravedra et al. (2021) of the frequency of anthropogenic marks and tooth marks has concluded that the hominins had primary access to the carcasses of a wide variety of ungulate prey, even though the frequency of evisceration marks is strikingly low. In this rebuttal, we analyse the patterns of bone preservation in FN3, which show that the exploitation of bone marrow by the hominins after hammerstone breakage was a usual activity at the site. Our study also reviews the evidence available on the lesser abilities of sabretooth cats for carcass processing compared to pantherine felids. This reinforces the hypothesis that primary predators provided the hominins the opportunity to scavenge sizeable chunks of meat and bone marrow of their prey carcasses before the arrival of hyaenas. Finally, we also provide new inferences on resource availability and competition intensity among the members of the carnivore guild in FN3, which reinforce our interpretation that a secondary access by the Oldowan hominins to the prey leftovers of sabretooth cats was an optimal foraging strategy in the Guadix-Baza Depression.},

 abstract = {Distributed adaptations are cases in which adaptation is dependent on the population as a whole: the adaptation is conferred by a structural or compositional aspect of the population; the adaptively relevant information cannot be reduced to information possessed by a single individual. Possible examples of human-distributed adaptations are song lines, traditions, trail systems, game drive lanes and systems of water collection and irrigation. Here we discuss the possible role of distributed adaptations in human cultural macro-evolution. Several kinds of human-distributed adaptations are presented, and their evolutionary implications are highlighted. In particular, we discuss the implications of population size, density and bottlenecks on the distributed adaptations that a population may possess and how they in turn would affect the population's resilience to ecological change. We discuss the implications that distributed adaptations may have for human collective action and the possibility that they played a role in colonization of new areas and niches, in seasonal migration, and in setting constraints for minimal inter-population connectivity.

 abstract = {This work examines the possible behaviour of Neanderthal groups at the Cueva Des-Cubierta (central Spain) via the analysis of the latter’s archaeological assemblage. Alongside evidence of Mousterian lithic industry, Level 3 of the cave infill was found to contain an assemblage of mammalian bone remains dominated by the crania of large ungulates, some associated with small hearths. The scarcity of post-cranial elements, teeth, mandibles and maxillae, along with evidence of anthropogenic modification of the crania (cut and percussion marks), indicates that the carcasses of the corresponding animals were initially processed outside the cave, and the crania were later brought inside. A second round of processing then took place, possibly related to the removal of the brain. The continued presence of crania throughout Level 3 indicates that this behaviour was recurrent during this level’s formation. This behaviour seems to have no subsistence-related purpose but to be more symbolic in its intent.},

 abstract = {Abstract Humans produce two forms of cognitively complex vocalizations: speech and song. It is debated whether these differ based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or if acoustical features can reliably distinguish them. We study the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies across six continents. Specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations, overlapping within categories and across societies, significantly differentiate speech from song. Machine-learning classification shows that this effect is cross-culturally robust, vocalizations being reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal features across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with the cultures classify these vocalizations using similar spectro-temporal cues as the machine learning algorithm. Finally, spectro-temporal features are better able to discriminate song from speech than a broad range of other acoustical variables, suggesting that spectro-temporal modulation—a key feature of auditory neuronal tuning—accounts for a fundamental difference between these categories.  Two-Sentence Summary What distinguishes singing from speaking? The authors show that consistent acoustical spectro-temporal features are sufficient to distinguish speech and song reliably across different societies throughout the world. },

 abstract = {Abstract This article draws upon ethnographic fieldwork among children in Helsinki, Finland, to determine how cooperative behaviors unfold in their everyday lives. Two concepts—fairness and partner choice—emerged as particularly relevant, and related behaviors were examined in the context of ongoing debates regarding cooperation in human societies. Children consistently invoked fairness as an important moral value, and they showed evidence of undergoing a developmental shift from equality‐based to equity‐based fairness by around seven years old. Children mediated disagreements primarily through partner choice strategies (avoidance and disengagement) rather than partner conflict (punishment). Local social values and child‐rearing practices that promote personal autonomy and independence make punishment undesirable and rare in this context. The observed aversion to punishment in Helsinki differs from typical characterizations of so‐called WEIRD societies and demonstrates the value that nuanced ethnographic studies in diverse societies can bring to understandings of human cooperation.
Abstrakti  Artikkelissa tarkastellaan etnografisen kenttätyöaineiston pohjalta, miten yhteistyöhaluinen käyttäytyminen kehittyy helsinkiläisten lasten arjessa. Kaksi käsitettä – oikeudenmukaisuus ( fairness ) ja partnerin valinta (partner choice) – nousivat aineistosta erityisen oleellisiksi, ja niitä tutkittiin suhteessa inhimillistä yhteistyötä koskeviin viimeaikaisiin debatteihin. Lapset pitivät oikeudenmukaisuutta tärkeänä moraalisena arvona, ja aineiston perusteella heidän käsityksensä oikeudenmukaisuudesta kehittyi tasapuolisesta (equality‐based) tarveperustaiseen (equity‐based) oikeudenmukaisuuteen noin 7 vuoden ikään mennessä. Lasten väliset erimielisyydet soviteltiin ensisijaisesti partnerinvalintastrategioiden kautta partnerikonfliktin (rangaistuksen) sijaan. Paikalliset sosiaaliset arvot ja lastenkasvatustavat, jotka korostavat henkilökohtaista autonomiaa ja itsenäisyyttä, tekevät rangaistuksista ei‐toivottuja ja harvinaisia tässä kontekstissa. Helsingissä havaittu rangaistuksen vastenmielisyys poikkeaa niin kutsuttujen WEIRD‐yhteiskuntien tyypillisistä piirteistä, mikä osoittaa, kuinka tärkeää vivahteikas etnografinen tutkimus monenlaisissa yhteisöissä voi olla inhimillisen yhteistyön ymmärtämiselle. },

 abstract = {Abstract
Although intra-site spatial approaches are considered a key factor when interpreting archaeological assemblages, these are often based on descriptive, qualitative, and subjective observations. Currently, within the framework of research into spatial taphonomy and palimpsest dissection, several studies have begun to employ more quantitative and objective techniques, implementing tools such as geostatistics and geographic information system (GIS) methods. This is precisely the approach that the Abric Romaní team is following. In this work, we present GIS and geostatistics methods applied to the faunal and lithic assemblages from archaeolevel Ob, including an analysis of the spatial structure, the identification of clusters and sectors, size and fabric analyses, the projection of vertical profiles, and the reconstruction of a digital elevation model of the paleosurface. The results obtained indicate a clustered distribution, primarily concentrated into four dense accumulations. The predominance of remains < 3 cm in length and the absence of preferential orientations make it possible to rule out a generalised postdepositional movement affecting most of the site, although some local movement has been identified. The horizontal and vertical spatial analyses allow us to identify accumulations of a single material (lithic or faunal) in addition to mixed accumulations (lithic and faunal). Integrating all this data with the results of previous studies (zooarchaeological, refits, combustion structures, and partial lithic technological analyses), we evaluate and combine the interpretations proposed previously using different approaches, thereby improving the overall interpretation of the archaeolevel Ob. Finally, we also develop a preliminary comparison between Ob and some other levels at the same site (in particular M and P).},

It was near the middle of the twentieth century when archaeologists actively began to quantify the materials they recovered. In archaeobotany and zooarchaeology, there exist relatively simple counting units, some simple statistical manipulations of data, and with increases in computer power and statistical sophistication, a number of increasingly complex multivariate analytical methods. Plant remains range from macroscopic – anything not requiring a microscope to observe and identify, such as seeds, leaves, and stems – to microscopic materials such as pollen, phytoliths, and starch residues. Zooarchaeologists have something of an advantage over palaeoethnobotanists when it comes to quantification. Quantitative data in zooarchaeology and archaeobotany also facilitate intersite comparisons such that the analyst can zoom out and study patterns across space and changes over time for topics such as past diet or landscapes.},

 abstract = {Shift of ingestive behavior is an important strategy for animals to adapt to change of the environment. We knew that shifts in animal dietary habits lead to changes in the structure of the gut microbiota, but we are not sure about if changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota respond to changes in the nutrient intake or food items. To investigate how animal feeding strategies affect nutrient intakes and thus alter the composition and digestion function of gut microbiota, we selected a group of wild primate group for the study. We quantified their diet and macronutrients intake in four seasons of a year, and instant fecal samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenomics. These results demonstrated that the main reason that causes seasonal shifts of gut microbiota is the macronutrient variation induced by seasonal dietary differences. Gut microbes can help to compensate for insufficient macronutrients intake of the host through microbial metabolic functions. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the causes of seasonal variation in host-microbial variation in wild primates.},

Progress has been hindered, we argue, by presumptions about nonverbal behavior that follow from both received wisdom and faulty evidence. In this article, we document four persistent misconceptions about nonverbal communication-namely, that people communicate using decodable body language; that they have a stable personal space by which they regulate contact with others; that they express emotion using universal, evolved, iconic, categorical facial expressions; and that they can deceive and detect deception, using dependable telltale clues. We show how these misconceptions permeate research as well as the practices of popular behavior experts, with consequences that extend from intimate relationships to the boardroom and courtroom and even to the arena of international security. Notwithstanding these misconceptions, existing frameworks of nonverbal communication are being challenged by more comprehensive systems approaches and by virtual technologies that ambiguate the roles and identities of interactants and the contexts of interaction.},

A phylosymbiotic link between Bangladeshi indigenous people and certain ethnic groups in India have also been discovered. A comparative analysis between all Bangladeshi samples (n=55) and several tropical and subtropical countries (n=132) such as Australia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam revealed that the gut microbiota profile of Bangladeshi people is remarkably distinct from others. The insights from this study will aid further epidemiological and translational research.

 abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess if molasses could modify VFA production and the rumen microbial community in vitro. Three beet (treatment Beet) and three cane (treatment Cane) molasses preparations were randomly selected from a variety of samples collected worldwide and incubated in vitro with rumen fluid along with a control sample (treatment CTR, in which no molasses was used). Flasks for VFA analysis were sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h of each incubation. For microbiota analysis, samples from each fermentation flask after 12 and 24 h were subjected to microbial DNA extraction and V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Total net VFA production was higher in the beet and cane preparations than in the control (CTR) group at 24 h (33 mmol/L, 34 mmol/L, and 24.8 mmol/L, respectively), and the composition of VFAs was affected by the inclusion of molasses: acetic acid increased in the CTR group (73.5 mol%), while propionic acid increased in the beet and cane molasses (19.6 mol% and 18.6 mol%, respectively), and butyric acid increased, especially in the cane group (23.2 mol%). Molasses even influenced the composition of the rumen microbiota, and particularly the relative abundance of the most dominant family in the rumen, Prevotellaceae, which decreased compared to CTR (37.13%, 28.88%, and 49.6%, respectively). In contrast, Streptococcaceae (19.62% and 28.10% in molasses compared to 6.23% in CTR), Veillonellaceae (6.48% and 8.67% in molasses compared to 4.54% in CTR), and Fibrobacteraceae (0.90% and 0.88% in molasses compared to 0.62% in CTR) increased in the beet and cane groups compared to the CTR group. Another important finding is the lower proportion of Methanobacteriaceae following the addition of molasses compared to CTR (0.26%, 0.28%, and 0.43%, respectively). This study showed the impact of molasses in influencing VFA production and composition as a result of a modified rumen microbial composition.},

 abstract = {The production of sharp-edged stone flakes is often viewed as a unique adaptation specific to the hominin lineage. The discovery of large stone cores and flakes dated to 3.3 Ma has shown that the earliest evidence of hominin stone flake production differs from the later Oldowan (dated to 2.6 Ma) record. Recent discoveries have shown that capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) can unintentionally produce sharp-edged flake assemblages as a by-product of percussive behaviour. Capuchin monkeys are the only wild primate to intentionally strike two stones together (stone-on-stone percussion) to produce quartz powder. In doing so, they unintentionally produce high frequencies of sharp-edged flakes. It has been suggested that these possess the same technological attributes commonly used to describe intentional hominin stone flakes. Here we directly compare the basic morphometric descriptions, technological and 3D morphometric properties of unintentional capuchin flakes with experimentally produced flakes derived from two intentional flaking techniques employed during the Plio-Pleistocene, freehand and passive hammer knapping and a sample of Oldowan freehand flakes from Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania). Our results show that unintentional stone-on-stone flakes overlap in terms of their shape, size and technological attributes with those produced through intentional knapping techniques. We, however, identify attributes that may be critical for differentiating between intentional knapping techniques documented in the early archaeological record and unintentional flakes. Using these data we show that Oldowan flakes more closely resemble intentional freehand techniques.},

Der unterhaltsam und leicht verständlich geschriebene Ratgeber zeigt mögliche Auswege aus dieser Krankheit und will somit zu einer Verbesserung der Lebensqualität von Adipösen beitragen. Der Autor, ein erfahrener Chirurg, war Leiter des Adipositas-Centrums Münster und erklärt einfühlsam die Hintergründe des Krankheitsbilds und die Grenzen der nicht-operativen Behandlungsmöglichkeiten. Im Mittelpunkt einer erfolgreichen Therapie steht ein ganzheitliches Konzept, in dem die Adipositas-Chirurgie wie ein Mosaikstein in ein komplexes Behandlungsregime eingebettet ist. Es gibt eben doch Lösungen jenseits von Frühlingsdiät und Jojo-Falle! Nicht durch eine neue Diät als letztem Schrei oder andere Zaubertricks, sondern mittels professioneller Diagnostik, Beratung und einer operativen Maßnahme können Übergewichtige wieder zu einem leichteren Leben zurückkehren. Durch umfangreiche Informationen will der Autor seinen Leser*innen die Angst vor einer Operation nehmen und Selbsthilfegruppen bei ihrer Aufklärungsarbeit unterstützen. Denn: Für die meisten Betroffenen ist die Operation nach aktuellsten wissenschaftliche Erkenntnissen keine „Ultima Ratio“, sondern der einzig erfolgversprechende Weg.

 abstract = {How organisms capture and ultimately use metabolic energy-a limiting resource of life-has profound implications for understanding evolutionary legacies and current patterns of phenotypic variation, adaptation, and health. Energetics research among humans has a rich history in biological anthropology and beyond. The energetics of childhood, however, remains relatively underexplored. This shortcoming is notable given the accepted importance of childhood in the evolution of the unique human life history pattern as well as the known sensitivity of childhood development to local environments and lived experiences. In this review, I have three objectives: (1) To overview current knowledge regarding how children acquire and use energy, highlighting work among diverse human populations and pointing to recent advances and remaining areas of uncertainty; (2) To discuss key applications of this knowledge for understanding human variation, evolution, and health; (3) To recommend future avenues for research. A growing body of evidence supports a model of trade-offs and constraint in childhood energy expenditure. This model, combined with advancements on topics such as the energetics of immune activity, the brain, and the gut, provides insights into the evolution of extended human subadulthood and the nature of variation in childhood development, lifetime phenotype, and health.},

 abstract = {BackgroundTime to diagnosis and treatment is a major factor in determining the likelihood of tuberculosis (TB) transmission and is an important area of intervention to reduce the reservoir of TB infection and prevent disease and mortality. Although Indigenous peoples experience an elevated incidence of TB, prior systematic reviews have not focused on this group. We summarize and report findings related to time to diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary TB (PTB) among Indigenous peoples, globally.MethodsA Systematic review was performed using Ovid and PubMed databases. Articles or abstracts estimating time to diagnosis, or treatment of PTB among Indigenous peoples were included with no restriction on sample size with publication dates restricted up to 2019. Studies that focused on outbreaks, solely extrapulmonary TB alone in non-Indigenous populations were excluded. Literature was assessed using the Hawker checklist. Registration Protocol (PROSPERO): CRD42018102463.ResultsTwenty-four studies were selected after initial assessment of 2021 records. These included Indigenous groups from five of six geographical regions outlined by the World Health Organization (all except the European Region). The range of time to treatment (24–240 days), and patient delay (20 days–2.5 years) were highly variable across studies and, in at least 60% of the studies, longer in Indigenous compared to non-Indigenous peoples. Risk factors associated with longer patient delays included poor awareness of TB, type of health provider first seen, and self-treatment.ConclusionTime to diagnosis and treatment estimates for Indigenous peoples are generally within previously reported ranges from other systematic reviews focusing on the general population. However among literature examined in this systematic review that stratified by Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, patient delay and time to treatment were longer compared to non-Indigenous populations in over half of the studies. Studies included were sparse and highlight an overall gap in literature important to interrupting transmission and preventing new TB cases among Indigenous peoples. Although, risk factors unique to Indigenous populations were not identified, further investigation is needed as social determinants of health among studies conducted in medium and high incidence countries may be shared across both population groups.Trial registration N/a.},

A development that had a particularly important impact in anthropological genetics was the introduction of the Polymerase Chain Reaction by Mullis in 1984. Each individual actually possesses two independent genomes. The nuclear genome located in the nucleus of each cell is comprised of DNA packaged into 23 pairs of linear structures called chromosomes. The full complement of chromosomes is called the karyotype.

 abstract = {Intentionally produced sharp-edged stone flakes and flaked pieces are our primary evidence for the emergence of technology in our lineage. This evidence is used to decipher the earliest hominin behavior, cognition, and subsistence strategies. Here, we report on the largest lithic assemblage associated with a primate foraging behavior undertaken by long-tailed macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). This behavior results in a landscape-wide record of flaked stone material, almost indistinguishable from early hominin flaked pieces and flakes. It is now clear that the production of unintentional conchoidal sharp-edged flakes can result from tool-assisted foraging in nonhominin primates. Comparisons with Plio-Pleistocene lithic assemblages, dating from 3.3 to 1.56 million years ago, show that flakes produced by macaques fall within the technological range of artifacts made by early hominins. In the absence of behavioral observations, the assemblage produced by monkeys would likely be identified as anthropogenic in origin and interpreted as evidence of intentional tool production.},

The discovery of antibiotics, increasing levels of pollution, and urban and agricultural intensification have led to the proliferation and diversification of novel resistance genes and microorganisms. This abundance has unfolded against a backdrop of microbial absence that is the other side of the antimicrobial coin; reductions in the quantity and diversity of human-microbe interactions are now registering as epidemics of chronic non-communicable diseases in urban populations. Building from this paradoxical situation of ‘abundance’ and ‘absence’, this article reviews the molecular-genetic, macroscale-infrastructural, and community-ecological aspects of microbial evolution at a time when human actions are a critical force in shaping their directions.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Background The question of which ecological and evolutionary processes structure the distribution of biodiversity has intrigued scientists for centuries, and historically, inferences have been gained predominantly by studying animals and plants. Although substantial progress has been made towards understanding the multitude of factors that shape host‐associated microbial communities (i.e., microbiomes), it remains largely unknown whether large‐scale geographical patterns in diversity observed for macroorganisms also apply for their microbiomes and whether microbiomes are shaped by the same processes that appear key for determining biogeographical patterns in their hosts.   The geographical distribution of microbiome diversity We discuss challenges and potential approaches for studying microbiome biogeography, with the goal of inspiring future lines of research that can stimulate the development of new ecological and evolutionary theory in the microbiome field. The theory and examples presented here focus specifically on bacterial microbiomes, and we give an overview of host‐associated bacterial microbiome research beginning to examine some of the classic biodiversity patterns central to the fields of ecology and evolution.   Potential impacts of microbiome variation for host ecology and evolution Microbiome diversity patterns are particularly important to consider because microbes are crucial for many aspects of the biology of their hosts. We discuss how more comprehensive knowledge of the geographical variation of microbiome diversity at the host individual and population levels might be crucial for understanding host ecology and evolution. },

However, little is known about the distribution patterns at sites identified as hunting camps, i.e., places occupied over multiple short periods for the capture of animals later transported to a base camp. The present work examines a Neanderthal hunting camp (the Navalmaíllo Rock Shelter in Pinilla del Valle, Madrid, Spain) to determine whether different activities were undertaken in different areas of the site. A spatial pattern was detected with a main cluster of materials (lithic tools, faunal remains, and coprolites) clearly related to the presence of nearby hearths—the backbone of the utilised space. This main cluster appears to have been related to collaborative and repetitive activities undertaken by the hunting parties that used the site. Spatial analysis also detected a small, isolated area perhaps related to carcasses processing at some point in time and another slightly altered by water.},

 abstract = {The urban peoples of the Swahili coast traded across eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and were among the first practitioners of Islam among sub-Saharan people1,2. The extent to which these early interactions between Africans and non-Africans were accompanied by genetic exchange remains unknown. Here we report ancient DNA data for 80 individuals from 6 medieval and early modern (ad 1250–1800) coastal towns and an inland town after ad 1650. More than half of the DNA of many of the individuals from coastal towns originates from primarily female ancestors from Africa, with a large proportion—and occasionally more than half—of the DNA coming from Asian ancestors. The Asian ancestry includes components associated with Persia and India, with 80–90% of the Asian DNA originating from Persian men. Peoples of African and Asian origins began to mix by about ad 1000, coinciding with the large-scale adoption of Islam. Before about ad 1500, the Southwest Asian ancestry was mainly Persian-related, consistent with the narrative of the Kilwa Chronicle, the oldest history told by people of the Swahili coast3. After this time, the sources of DNA became increasingly Arabian, consistent with evidence of growing interactions with southern Arabia4. Subsequent interactions with Asian and African people further changed the ancestry of present-day people of the Swahili coast in relation to the medieval individuals whose DNA we sequenced.},

 abstract = {As the ancestral homeland of our species, Africa contains elevated levels of genetic diversity and substantial population structure. Importantly, African genomes are heterogeneous: They contain mixtures of multiple ancestries, each of which have experienced different evolutionary histories. In this review, we view population genetics through the lens of admixture, highlighting how multiple demographic events have shaped African genomes. Each of these historical vignettes paints a recurring picture of population divergence followed by secondary contact. First, we give a brief overview of genetic variation in Africa and examine deep population structure within Africa, including the evidence of ancient introgression from archaic "ghost" populations. Second, we describe the genetic legacies of admixture events that have occurred during the past 10,000 years. This includes gene flow between different click-speaking Khoe-San populations, the stepwise spread of pastoralism from eastern to southern Africa, multiple migrations of Bantu speakers across the continent, as well as admixture from the Middle East and Europe into the Sahel region and North Africa. Furthermore, the genomic signatures of more recent admixture can be found in the Cape Peninsula and throughout the African diaspora. Third, we highlight how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the continent, noting that gene flow provides a potent source of adaptive variation and that selective pressures vary across Africa. Finally, we explore the biomedical implications of population structure in Africa on health and disease and call for more ethically conducted studies of genetic variation in Africa.},

 abstract = {<b>Aim:</b> The human gut <i>Bifidobacterium</i> community has been studied in detail in infants and following dietary interventions in adults. However, the variability of the distribution of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species and intra-species functions have been little studied, particularly beyond infancy. Here, we explore the ecology of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> communities in a large public dataset of human gut metagenomes, mostly corresponding to adults. <b>Methods:</b> We selected 9.515 unique gut metagenomes from curatedMetagenomicData. Samples were partitioned by applying Dirichlet's multinomial mixture to <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species. A functional analysis was performed on &gt; 2.000 human-associated <i>Bifidobacterium</i> metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) paired with participant gut microbiome and health features. <b>Results:</b> We identified several <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-based partitions in the human gut microbiome differing in terms of the presence and abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species. The partitions enriched in both <i>B. longum</i> and <i>B. adolescentis</i> were associated with gut microbiome diversity and a higher abundance of butyrate producers and were more prevalent in healthy individuals. <i>B. bifidum</i> MAGs harboring a set of genes potentially related to phages were more prevalent in partitions associated with a lower gut microbiome diversity and were genetically more closely related. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study expands our knowledge of the ecology and variability of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> community, particularly in adults, and its specific association with the gut microbiota and health. Its findings may guide the rational selection of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> strains for gut microbiome complementation according to the individual's endogenous <i>Bifidobacterium</i> community. Our results also suggest that gut microbiome stratification for particular genera may be relevant for studies of variations of species and associations with the gut microbiome and health.},

@article{pub.1157118119,
 abstract = {The basis of property rights is a central problem in political philosophy. The core philosophical dispute concerns whether property rights are natural facts, independent of human conventions. In this article, we examine adult judgments on this issue. We find evidence that familiar property norms regarding external objects (e.g., fish and strawberries) are treated as conventional on standard measures of authority dependence and context relativism. Previous work on the moral/conventional distinction indicates that people treat property rights as moral rather than conventional (e.g., Dahl & Waltzer, 2020; Nucci & Turiel, 1993; Tisak & Turiel, 1984). However, these studies explicitly assume that one person owns property that another steals. Study 1 explores judgments of authority dependence regarding ownership in cases that explicitly appeal to stealing and prior ownership as compared to cases that omit such explicit appeals. We find that participants tend to treat ownership as authority dependent when explicit appeals to stealing are absent, but not when the explicit appeals are present. Study 2 examines intuitions about authority dependence of ownership violations as compared to canonical conventional and harm-based moral violations. We find that ownership violations are treated as more authority dependent than harm-based moral violations. This all suggests that some central property norms are treated as conventional. However, we also find that the conventionality of property norms is restricted in several ways. In study 3, we find that people do not treat norms of self-ownership as conventional. Other people cannot take your hair or skin cells even if the teacher says it's okay. Study 4 uses a measure of context relativism to examine the conventionality of ownership norms, comparing different possible norms of ownership. We find that participants regard takings that are violations in their own culture as permissible in other cultures; however, only some foreign norms are deemed acceptable. In study 5 we find another limitation - participants think it's impermissible to take resources from someone based on a new property norm that is retrospectively imposed. Finally, in study 6 we explore whether some takings might be judged to be morally (non-conventionally) wrong as a function of scarcity. We find that when asked about another culture that allows taking, participants tend to say that taking a food item from the person who caught it is permissible when the food is plentiful, but not when the food is scarce.},

We show that instrumental imitation, contingent teaching, generative collaboration, and selective copying contribute to domain‐specific transmission of knowledge between peers. Stages of development and characteristics inherent to the learner and model influence how and when children learn from each other. Peer learning is persistent across societies despite cultural beliefs that favor adult–child transmission in some settings. Comparative research hints at the possibility that children's greater motivation to interact with and learn from each other may set humans apart from other primates. We conclude by outlining avenues for future research, including how individual characteristics and developmental changes in social networks, motivation, and cognition may contribute to cultural evolution.},

However, the effects on living organisms still need to be properly understood. The present study was designed to assess the combined effects of MPs and environmental contaminants on zebrafish (Danio rerio) health and behavior. Adult specimens were fed according to three different protocols: 1) untreated food (Control group); 2) food supplemented with 0.4 mg/L pristine polyethylene-MPs (PE-MPs; 0.1-0.3 mm diameter) (PEv group); 3) food supplemented with 0.4 mg/L PE-MPs previously incubated (PEi group) for 2 months in seawater. Analysis of contaminants in PEi detected trace elements, such as lead and copper. After 15 days of exposure, zebrafish underwent behavioral analysis and were then dissected to sample gills and intestine for histology, and the latter also for microbiome analysis. Occurrence of PEv and PEi in the intestine and contaminants in the fish carcass were analyzed. Both PEv- and PEi-administered fish differed from controls in the assays performed, but PEi produced more harmful effects in most instances. Overall, MPs after environmental exposure revealed higher potential to alter fish health through combined effects (e.g. proportion of microplastics, pollutants and/or microorganisms).},

 abstract = {Cross-cohort validation is essential for gut-microbiome-based disease stratification but was only performed for limited diseases. Here, we systematically evaluated the cross-cohort performance of gut microbiome-based machine-learning classifiers for 20 diseases. Using single-cohort classifiers, we obtained high predictive accuracies in intra-cohort validation (~0.77 AUC), but low accuracies in cross-cohort validation, except the intestinal diseases (~0.73 AUC). We then built combined-cohort classifiers trained on samples combined from multiple cohorts to improve the validation of non-intestinal diseases, and estimated the required sample size to achieve validation accuracies of >0.7. In addition, we observed higher validation performance for classifiers using metagenomic data than 16S amplicon data in intestinal diseases. We further quantified the cross-cohort marker consistency using a Marker Similarity Index and observed similar trends. Together, our results supported the gut microbiome as an independent diagnostic tool for intestinal diseases and revealed strategies to improve cross-cohort performance based on identified determinants of consistent cross-cohort gut microbiome alterations.},

 abstract = {Landscape, climate, and culture can all structure human populations, but few existing methods are designed to simultaneously disentangle among a large number of variables in explaining genetic patterns. We developed a machine learning method for identifying the variables which best explain migration rates, as measured by the coalescent-based program MAPS that uses shared identical by descent tracts to infer spatial migration across a region of interest. We applied our method to 30 human populations in eastern Africa with high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array data. The remarkable diversity of ethnicities, languages, and environments in this region offers a unique opportunity to explore the variables that shape migration and genetic structure. We explored more than 20 spatial variables relating to landscape, climate, and presence of tsetse flies. The full model explained ∼40% of the variance in migration rate over the past 56 generations. Precipitation, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and elevation were the variables with the highest impact. Among the three groups of tsetse flies, the most impactful was fusca which transmits livestock trypanosomiasis. We also tested for adaptation to high elevation among Ethiopian populations. We did not identify well-known genes related to high elevation, but we did find signatures of positive selection related to metabolism and disease. We conclude that the environment has influenced the migration and adaptation of human populations in eastern Africa; the remaining variance in structure is likely due in part to cultural or other factors not captured in our model.},

 abstract = {Humans' sophisticated language system and advanced ability to cooperate with non-relatives are unique amongst animals. Verbal arguments have asserted that language, in particular, facilitated the evolution of large-scale cooperation—but the specific mechanisms by which language influences cooperation have not been tested in formal models. Here we develop a mathematical model that explicitly considers three possible influences of language on the evolution of cooperation: 1) increasing the payoff of cooperative interactions, 2) allowing cooperation to succeed with fewer cooperators in the group, and 3) promoting the positive assortment of cooperators. Our results show that the role of language in the evolution of cooperation is not as straightforward as often believed, with each model variant showing a different effect of language. Notably, when language decreases the number of cooperators needed to successfully reach a positive group payoff, the equilibrium frequency of cooperators can actually decrease with increasing language proficiency. Language does consistently favor the evolution of cooperation when it leads to higher payoffs of cooperation or facilitates the positive assortment of cooperators. However, language cannot lead to the evolution of cooperation in a population of only defectors, except when it leads to positive assortment in both cooperators and defectors. Overall, our results demonstrate that the way that language alters cooperative interactions determines its effect on social evolution.},

 abstract = {Color naming in natural languages is not arbitrary: it reflects efficient
partitions of perceptual color space modulated by the relative needs to
communicate about different colors. These psychophysical and communicative
constraints help explain why languages around the world have remarkably
similar, but not identical, mappings of colors to color terms. Languages
converge on a small set of efficient representations. But languages also
evolve, and the number of terms in a color vocabulary may change over time.
Here we show that history, i.e. the existence of an antecedent color
vocabulary, acts as a non-adaptive constraint that biases the choice of
efficient solution as a language transitions from a vocabulary of size n to n+1
terms. Moreover, as vocabularies evolve to include more terms they explore a
smaller fraction of all possible efficient vocabularies compared to
equally-sized vocabularies constructed de novo. This path dependence on the
cultural evolution of color naming presents an opportunity. Historical
constraints can be used to reconstruct ancestral color vocabularies, allowing
us to answer long-standing questions about the evolutionary sequences of color
words, and enabling us to draw inferences from phylogenetic patterns of
language change.},

 abstract = {It has been argued that hunter-gatherers' food-sharing may have provided the basis for a whole range of social interactions, and hence its study may provide important insight into the evolutionary origin of human sociality. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple network optimization model inspired by a food-sharing dynamic that can recover some empirical patterns found in social networks. We focus on two of the main food-sharing drivers discussed by the anthropological literature: the reduction of individual starvation risk and the care for the group welfare or egalitarian access to food shares, and show that networks optimizing both criteria may exhibit a community structure of highly-cohesive groups around special agents that we call hunters, those who inject food into the system. These communities appear under conditions of uncertainty and scarcity in the food supply, which suggests their adaptive value in this context. We have additionally obtained that optimal welfare networks resemble social networks found in lab experiments that promote more egalitarian income distribution, and also distinct distributions of reciprocity among hunters and non-hunters, which may be consistent with some empirical reports on how sharing is distributed in waves, first among hunters, and then hunters with their families. These model results are consistent with the view that social networks functionally adaptive for optimal resource use, may have created the environment in which prosocial behaviors evolved. Finally, our model also relies on an original formulation of starvation risk, and it may contribute to a formal framework to proceed in this discussion regarding the principles guiding food-sharing networks.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT  Background Increasing levels of industrialization have been associated with changes in gut microbiome structure and loss of features thought to be crucial for maintaining gut ecological balance. The stability of gut microbial communities over time within individuals seems to be largely affected by this transition but has been overlooked among transitioning populations from low to middle-income countries. Here, we used shotgun sequencing to characterize the temporal dynamics of gut microbiomes of 24 individuals living in an urban non-industrialized lifestyle in the Brazilian Amazon and contextualized our data with 165 matching longitudinal samples from an urban industrialized and a rural non-industrialized population.   Results We show that gut microbiome composition and diversity have greater variability over time among non-industrialized individuals when compared to industrialized counterparts and that taxa may present diverse temporal dynamics across human populations. Enterotype classifications show community types are generally stable over time despite shifts in microbiome structure. Further, by tracking genomes over time, we show that levels of bacterial population replacements are more frequent among Amazonian individuals and non-synonymous variants accumulate in genes associated with degradation of host dietary polysaccharides.   Conclusions Our results suggest that the stability of gut microbiomes is influenced by levels of industrialization and that tracking microbial population dynamics is important to understand how the microbiome will adapt to these transitions. },

 abstract = {A wide variety of human diseases are associated with loss of microbial diversity in the human gut, inspiring a great interest in the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of the microbiota. However, the ecological forces that drive diversity reduction in disease states remain unclear, rendering it difficult to ascertain the role of the microbiota in disease emergence or severity. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that microbial diversity is diminished as disease states select for microbial populations that are more fit to survive environmental stress caused by inflammation or other host factors. Here, we tested this hypothesis on a large scale, by developing a software framework to quantify the enrichment of microbial metabolisms in complex metagenomes as a function of microbial diversity. We applied this framework to over 400 gut metagenomes from individuals who are healthy or diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that high metabolic independence (HMI) is a distinguishing characteristic of microbial communities associated with individuals diagnosed with IBD. A classifier we trained using the normalized copy numbers of 33 HMI-associated metabolic modules not only distinguished states of health versus IBD, but also tracked the recovery of the gut microbiome following antibiotic treatment, suggesting that HMI is a hallmark of microbial communities in stressed gut environments.},

 abstract = {Tropical root and tuber crops are considered as the third important crops after cereals and grain legumes and have important role in food security, nutrition and climate change adaptation. Tuber crops have the highest biological efficiency of all the crops and produce the most dry matter per day per unit area. The high photosynthetic ability of the tuber crops coupled with the tolerance to pests, diseases and drought and adaptability to various agro-ecological zones as well as marginal soils make them ideal crops in developing and less developed nations. The main nutritional value of roots and tubers is attributed to their high energy content, which is approximately one-third of an equivalent weight of grain, such as rice or wheat. Besides being an underground food or energy storehouse, most of the root and tuber crops are also rich in vitamins and minerals. Nutritional disorders resulting from the deficiency of vitamin A, vitamin C and calcium can be easily alleviated by consumption of tuber crops like cassava, sweet potato, yams and aroids. The orange- and yellow-fleshed sweet potato roots and green leaves are good sources of vitamin A, which can prevent night blindness and malnutrition. Sweet potato is also rich in antioxidants such as β-carotene, ascorbic acid and tocopherol (vitamin E), which can prevent coronary disorders and many lifestyle diseases. There is a great variation in the nutritional quality of roots and tubers depending on the variety, location, soil type, agricultural practices, etc.},

El objetivo de este trabajo es identificar cómo las acciones tecnológicas y prácticas sociales configuraron un paisaje de canteras-taller en Antofagasta de la Sierra (provincia de Catamarca, Argentina). En este sentido, interesa conocer cómo las personas interactuaron con su entorno físico y la variabilidad de actividades que se realizaron en el interior de un paisaje de aprovisionamiento. Para ello se hicieron prospecciones sistemáticas, muestreos, excavaciones y un análisis tecno-tipológico de conjuntos líticos. A partir de este estudio se identificaron loci de actividades con un registro lítico con atributos tecno-tipológicos distintos. Entre los contextos arqueológicos documentados se encuentran campamentos de actividades múltiples, o AET, talleres de reducción de grandes nódulos, o ADT, parapetos (estructuras de muro simple con forma de U), acumulaciones de rocas y reparos rocosos. Cada una de estas áreas de actividades se emplaza en el interior de una zona de canteras-taller y conforma un paisaje social que fue utilizado persistentemente. Precisamente, a partir de esta investigación se logró comprender cómo las personas configuraron un paisaje de tareas a través de sus prácticas sociales y sus modos de habitar un lugar.
Abstract  Quarry-workshop sites are places where individuals and groups carry out several social practices linked to the procurement of lithic resources. The aim of this work is to identify how technological actions and social practices shaped a landscape of quarry-workshops in Antofagasta de la Sierra (Catamarca province, Argentina). Our main interest is knowing how people interacted with their physical environment and the variety of activities that were carried out within a procurement landscape. For this, systematic surveys, sampling, excavations, and techno-typological analysis of lithic assemblages were used. Through this study, loci of activities with a lithic record that present different techno-typological attributes were identified. Among the archaeological contexts recorded are multiple activity camps, or AET, workshops of nodule reduction, or ADT, parapetos (structures of simple walls with U shape), rock accumulations, and rockshelters. Each of these activity areas is located inside a quarry-workshop zone and integrates a social landscape that was used for thousands of years. Precisely from this research it is possible to understand how people configured taskscapes in quarry-workshops through their social practices and their ways of inhabiting a place. },

 abstract = {The microbial cells colonizing the human body form an ecosystem that is integral to the regulation and maintenance of human health. Elucidation of specific associations between the human microbiome and health outcomes is facilitating the development of microbiome-targeted recommendations and treatments (e.g., fecal microbiota transplant; pre-, pro-, and post-biotics) to help prevent and treat disease. However, the potential of such recommendations and treatments to improve human health has yet to be fully realized. Technological advances have led to the development and proliferation of a wide range of tools and methods to collect, store, sequence, and analyze microbiome samples. However, differences in methodology at each step in these analytic processes can lead to variability in results due to the unique biases and limitations of each component. This technical variability hampers the detection and validation of associations with small to medium effect sizes. Therefore, the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) Nutritional Microbiology Group Engaging Members (GEM), sponsored by the Institute for the Advancement of Food and Nutrition Sciences (IAFNS), hosted a satellite session on methods in nutrition and gut microbiome research to review currently available methods for microbiome research, best practices, as well as tools and standards to aid in comparability of methods and results. This manuscript summarizes the topics and research discussed at the session. Consideration of the guidelines and principles reviewed in this session will increase the accuracy, precision, and comparability of microbiome research and ultimately the understanding of the associations between the human microbiome and health.},

Ain Boucherit consists of two archaeological layers, Ain Boucherit Upper (AB-Up) and Ain Boucherit Lower (AB-Lw), estimated to ~ 1.9 Ma and ~ 2.4 Ma, respectively. Cutmarked and hammerstone percussed bones associated with Oldowan stone tools were found in both layers, with AB-Lw yielding the oldest in North Africa. The faunal assemblages from both deposits are dominated by small-sized bovids and equids. Evidence of cutmarks and percussion marks in both assemblages shows that hominins exploited animal carcasses, involving skinning, evisceration and defleshing activities. The evidence of meat and marrow acquisition is more abundant at AB-Lw with carnivore activity being scarce. However, the AB-Up assemblage shows more carnivore damage and less hominin-induced tool marks. Ain Boucherit evidence, is similar, in type and chronology, to that provided by the Early Pleistocene sites in East Africa (e.g., the Gona sites), where the oldest evidence of stone tools used in faunal exploitation have been discovered. This paper reports on the ability of early North African Oldowans to compete successfully for accessing animal resources with other predators.},

As a result, some previous assumptions of appendicular elements were tested, confirming the idea that spongy tissue have more bone grease and that the smaller fragments are more efficiency. Furthermore, new evidences showed that the selection of element, or part of them, which are mainly constituted of spongy tissue, enhance the extraction of this resource.

 abstract = {Honors Research: PPE @ UPenn | This thesis seeks to address some of the most central questions to the fields of political philosophy and political economy. How can social order and government develop from anarchy under standard economic assumptions of rationality, where all agents act strictly in their own interests? What are the deontological limits to the State’s use of force such that political legitimacy is maintained, and how do these ethical boundaries of government relate to moral obligations conferred upon individuals? Finally, what sets of policies and social institutions ought the State implement to achieve the best welfare outcomes for a society, and is there a necessary conflict between policy consequentialism and deontological ethics? This thesis will first show that a laissez-faire capitalist social order spontaneously emerges from the State of Nature as a result of mutual self-interest between rational agents, with the institution of government being a mere product of market forces that is best modeled as a locally-monopolized, excludable, collective entity with global competition. Then, this thesis will defend a theory of natural rights on the basis that persons are normatively separate, before establishing that laissez-faire capitalism and its contractual form of government are uniquely in compliance with these universal moral standards of conduct that predate the institution of any state. Finally, it will be argued in this thesis that the key tenets of laissez-faire capitalism - strong individual rights to life, liberty, and property - produce maximal human welfare from both individualist and collectivist aggregations, before such conclusions are translated into a foundation for limited government. These arguments serve to solidify libertarianism as both the dominant political philosophy and the globally convergent equilibrium of political organization, while also demonstrating that laissez-faire capitalism is the optimal form of social order.},

Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway has been reported to be associated with a wide range of human diseases. A growing number of in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the gut microbes and its complex metabolites can regulate host metabolic and immune responses through the mTOR pathway, and result in disorders of host phys-iological functions. In this review, we summarize the regulatory mechanisms of gut microbes and mTOR in different diseases, and discuss the crosstalk between gut microbes and their metabolites and mTOR in the disorders in gastrointestinal tract, liver, heart and other organs. We also discuss the promising appli-cation of multiple potential drugs that can adjust the gut microbiota and mTOR signal pathways. Despite the limited findings between gut microbes and mTOR, elucidating their relationship may provide new clues for the prevention and treatment of various diseases.},

 abstract = {Abstract    The small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the most commonly used marker for the identification of microbial taxa, but its full‐length reconstruction from high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) data remains challenging. Metagenomics and total RNA sequencing (total RNA‐Seq) are target‐PCR‐free HTS methods that are used to characterize microbial communities and simultaneously reconstruct SSU rRNA sequences. However, more testing is required to determine and improve their effectiveness.   We processed metagenomics and total RNA‐Seq data retrieved from a commercially available mock microbial community and an aquarium sample using 112 combinations of data processing tools. We determined the SSU rRNA reconstruction completeness of both sequencing methods for both samples and analysed the impact of data processing tools on SSU rRNA completeness.   In contrast to metagenomics, total RNA‐Seq allowed for the complete or near‐complete reconstruction of all mock community SSU rRNA sequences and generated up to 438 SSU rRNA sequences with ≥80% completeness from the aquarium sample using only 1/5 of an Illumina MiSeq run. SSU rRNA completeness of metagenomics significantly correlated with the genome size of mock community species. Data processing tools impacted SSU rRNA completeness, in particular the utilized assemblers.   These results are promising for the high‐throughput reconstruction of novel full‐length SSU rRNA sequences and could advance the simultaneous application of multiple ‐omics approaches in routine environmental assessments to allow for more holistic assessments of ecosystems.   },

Human microbiome data are biased toward industrialized populations, limiting our understanding of non-industrialized microbiomes. Here, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing on 351 fecal samples from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania and comparative populations in Nepal and California. We recovered 91,662 genomes of bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes, 44% of which are absent from existing unified datasets. We identified 124 gut-resident species vanishing in industrialized populations and highlighted distinct aspects of the Hadza gut microbiome related to in situ replication rates, signatures of selection, and strain sharing. Industrialized gut microbes were found to be enriched in genes associated with oxidative stress, possibly a result of microbiome adaptation to inflammatory processes. This unparalleled view of the Hadza gut microbiome provides a valuable resource, expands our understanding of microbes capable of colonizing the human gut, and clarifies the extensive perturbation induced by the industrialized lifestyle.},

 abstract = {Racialisation and colonialism are central to sustaining (dis)embodied inequalities. We bring together our distinct ethnographic projects to explore this. The first project accompanied a microbiome expedition involving Amazonian Indigenous non/human communities, whereas the second project focussed on medical professional’ encounters with Mbya Guarani communities in the Atlantic Forest region. Both projects explore racialised assumptions of human difference and colonial extractive practices. In the case of medical intervention with the Mbya, and their forms of life, this is perpetuated through the imposition of anthropometric growth standards. With the human microbiome initiatives, identifying Indigenous Peoples as potential reservoirs for novel probiotics also ultimately amplifies racialised (dis)embodied inequalities. Rather than these interventions addressing such disembodied equalities, we draw parallels between the two, to show that they perpetuate them. Finally, we propose that part of ceasing to reproduce these (dis)embodied inequalities requires ‘us’ to challenge the racialised and colonial histories of the life and geological sciences, to recognise their embodied consequences in the present, as well as how they are implicated in emergent proposals for new geological ‘-cenes’.},

We review the factors driving microbiome variation within and between individuals and populations, as well as comparative data from nonhuman primates that allow a more direct examination of microbial relationships with host ecology and evolution. Collectively, these data sets can help illuminate generalizable principles governing host-microbiome-environment interactions, the processes contributing to bidirectional influences between the human gut microbiota and the human ecological niche, and past changes in the human microbiome that may have harbored consequences for human adaptation. Developing richer insight into host-microbiome-environment interactions will ultimately broaden our view of human biology and its response to changing environments.},

 abstract = {Genetically determined variation of killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) and their HLA class I ligands affects multiple aspects of human health. Their extreme diversity is generated through complex interplay of natural selection for pathogen resistance and reproductive health, combined with demographic structure and dispersal. Despite significant importance to multiple health conditions of differential effect across populations, the nature and extent of immunogenetic diversity is under-studied for many geographic regions. Here, we describe the first high-resolution analysis of KIR and HLA class I combinatorial diversity in Northern Africa. Analysis of 125 healthy unrelated individuals from Cairo in Egypt yielded 186 KIR alleles arranged in 146 distinct centromeric and 79 distinct telomeric haplotypes. The most frequent haplotypes observed were KIR-A, encoding two inhibitory receptors specific for HLA-C, two that are specific for HLA-A and -B, and no activating receptors. Together with 141 alleles of HLA class I, 75 of which encode a KIR ligand, we identified a mean of six distinct interacting pairs of inhibitory KIR and HLA allotypes per individual. We additionally characterize 16 KIR alleles newly identified in the study population. Our findings place Egyptians as one of the most highly diverse populations worldwide, with important implications for transplant matching and studies of immune-mediated diseases.},

 abstract = {The narrative of the progression of the ‘horse family’ through geological time, from dog-sized fruit-eating animals with four toes on their front and three toes on their hind legs, to the valiant long-legged, single-toed modern grazing horses, beloved by racing enthusiasts, is the poster child of evolution. However, like the rhinos or tapirs, the horse-like zebras, wild asses, kulans, kiangs, onagers, and the real horses are often portrayed as being past their evolutionary peak as compared to the more recently evolved ruminants (especially bovids and deer) which now dominate the grazing niche. That story of a species group over its evolutionary zenith is compelling, but anyone who has travelled in the remote savannas of Africa or the cold wild deserts of Central Asia is awed with herds of glorious animals that clearly do not ruminate. It appears as though these, so-named ‘hind-gut fermenters’, are perhaps much better adapted to these environments than one is led to believe. The purpose of this book is to dispel the myth of the inferior Equidae by describing, and investigating, the evolutionary and ecological journey of the horse family in all its glory.},

 abstract = {Zooarchaeology is the study of animal bones from archaeological sites. Africa has the longest archaeological record in the world, potentially extending into the Pliocene and spanning the entire Pleistocene epoch. However, in comparison to other regions of Eurasia, this extended chronology in Africa has not translated to larger numbers of identified sites, more even distribution of sites, or more abundant faunal data. Here, we describe the methods commonly used by zooarchaeologists to analyze faunal assemblages, followed by a summary of general faunal taxonomic patterns across the continent. We then compile data from all Pleistocene zooarchaeological assemblages in Africa for which there is a published record of the site in a peer-reviewed journal or book as of the end of 2020. This facilitates a region-by-region discussion of trends in readily available zooarchaeological data and evaluation of their potential to inform about past environments and hominin interactions with faunal communities. We note that faunal remains exclusively recovered from surface contexts are not included as it is not possible to ascertain their chronological coherence or certainty of association.The reviewed faunal assemblages (N = 409) display a great deal of variability in composition, size, and distribution patterns, largely driven by a combination of depositional factors (in which fossils are likely to preserve in stable depositional settings) and research emphasis (in which archaeologists have worked most intensively versus those less explored). This variability is also tied to the individual regional histories of archaeological infrastructure development, which support repositories and training centers in the form of museums and universities. Most of the faunal data come from eastern, southern, and northern Africa and the Horn, which have rich assemblages from both open-air and cave/rock shelter sites that span the Pleistocene. In contrast, most archaeofaunas from other regions derive from sheltered sites that emphasize the preservation of the Late Pleistocene part of the record and tend to comprise many more fragments. In spite of significant geographic and chronological bias, research on Pleistocene faunal assemblages from Africa has made substantial contributions to understanding early human–animal interactions, developing zooarchaeological methods, and reconstructing ancient environments. There is significant potential for future research to continue doing so, both by revisiting the existing assemblages with new methods and by excavating new ones.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the hypothesis that changes in hunting weapons during the Paleolithic were a direct response to a progressive decline in prey size. The study builds upon a unified hypothesis that explains Paleolithic human evolutionary and behavioral/cultural phenomena, including improved cognitive capabilities, as adaptations to mitigate declined energetic returns due to a decline in prey size. Five selected case studies in Africa and Europe were analyzed to test this hypothesis, focusing on the relative presence of megaherbivores (>1000 kg) in the transition between the Acheulean/Early Stone Age and the Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age. The findings indicate a decline in megaherbivores’ presence and biomass contribution in the studied transition period associated with the introduction of Levallois technology. We review the evolution of hunting weapons, including wooden-tipped and stone-tipped spears and bows and arrows. Analysis of tip size and breakage patterns indicate a reduction in point size over time, aligning with the declining prey size. We propose that changes in hunting weapons and strategies were driven by the practical and ontological incentives presented by the availability and size of prey. Developing smaller, more precise weapons required increased cognitive capacities, leading to the parallel evolution of human cognitive abilities.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Viruses are a core component of the human microbiome, impacting health and disease through interactions with gut bacteria 1 and the immune system 2 . Most viruses in the human microbiome are bacteriophages, which exclusively infect bacteria. Individual gut bacteriophages can affect bacterial bile acid deconjugation 3 , and can alter their infection strategy based on dietary content 4 . Up to recently, most studies of the gut virome have focused on low taxonomic scales (e.g., viral operational taxonomic units), hampering population-level analyses. We previously identified the expansive and widespread Candidatus Heliusviridae bacteriophage family in a cohort with inhabitants of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Here, we study their biodiversity and evolution in a wide variety of human populations. With a detailed phylogeny based on sequences from six viral genome databases, we now propose the Candidatus order Heliusvirales to accommodate these viruses. We identify Ca. Heliusvirales viruses in 80% of 5,441 individuals across 39 studies, and also in nine out of thirteen analyzed metagenomes from ancient humans that lived in Europe and North America between 1,000 and 5,000 years ago. We show that a large Ca. Heliusvirales lineage has diversified starting at the appearance of Homo sapiens some 200,000-300,000 years ago. Ancient peoples and modern hunter-gatherers further have distinct Ca. Heliusvirales populations that are characterized by lower richness than modern urbanized people. Within urbanized people, those suffering from type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as inflammatory bowel disease, have higher Ca. Heliusvirales richness than healthy controls. We thus conclude that these ancient core members of the human gut virome have thrived with increasingly westernized lifestyles of the human population. },

 abstract = {This article presents a formula for modeling the lifetime incidence of cancer in humans. The formula utilizes a Poisson distribution-based "np" model to predict cancer incidence, with "n" representing the effective number of cell turnover and "p" representing the probability of single-cell transformation. The model accurately predicts the observed incidence of cancer in humans when a reduction in cell turnover due to aging is taken into account. The model also suggests that cancer development is ultimately inevitable. The article proposes a theory of aging based on this concept, called the "np" theory. According to this theory, an organism maintains its order by balancing cellular entropy through continuous proliferation. However, cellular "information entropy" in the form of accumulated DNA mutations increases irreversibly over time, restricting the total number of cells an organism can generate throughout its lifetime. When cell division slows down and fails to compensate for the increased entropy in the system, aging occurs. Essentially, aging is the phenomenon of running out of predetermined cell resources. Different species have evolved separate strategies to utilize their limited cell resources throughout their life cycle.},

It is argued in this paper that fictive kinship language in religion (and some other non-religious contexts) recruits traits connected to Hamilton’s rule as it is expressed in Homo sapiens psychology. The effect is that cooperation is augmented within a population that generally shares the same religious worldview. The general position is that if religions are in the business of cooperation and this partially accounts for their evolution and preservation, then it follows that we should take particular note of any significant feature of religions that might lend itself to the cooperation account of religion’s apparent evolutionary success.

 abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the pathobiology of the disease. Although HLA genes have emerged as the strongest genetic factor linked to MS, consensus on the environmental risk factors is lacking. Recently, the gut microbiota has garnered increasing attention as a potential environmental factor in MS, as mounting evidence suggests that individuals with MS exhibit microbial dysbiosis (changes in the gut microbiome). Thus, there has been a strong emphasis on understanding the role of the gut microbiome in the pathobiology of MS, specifically, factors regulating the gut microbiota and the mechanism(s) through which gut microbes may contribute to MS. Among all factors, diet has emerged to have the strongest influence on the composition and function of gut microbiota. As MS patients lack gut bacteria capable of metabolizing dietary phytoestrogen, we will specifically discuss the role of a phytoestrogen diet and phytoestrogen metabolizing gut bacteria in the pathobiology of MS. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help to harness the enormous potential of the gut microbiota as potential therapeutics to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases.},

 abstract = {The new field of primate archaeology investigates the technological behavior and material record of nonhuman primates, providing valuable comparative data on our understanding of human technological evolution. Yet, paralleling hominin archaeology, the field is largely biased toward the analysis of lithic artifacts. While valuable comparative data have been gained through an examination of extant nonhuman primate tool use and its archaeological record, focusing on this one single aspect provides limited insights. It is therefore necessary to explore to what extent other non-technological activities, such as non-tool aided feeding, traveling, social behaviors or ritual displays, leave traces that could be detected in the archaeological record. Here we propose four new areas of investigation which we believe have been largely overlooked by primate archaeology and that are crucial to uncovering the full archaeological potential of the primate behavioral repertoire, including that of our own: (1) Plant technology; (2) Archaeology beyond technology; (3) Landscape archaeology; and (4) Primate cultural heritage. We discuss each theme in the context of the latest developments and challenges, as well as propose future directions. Developing a more "inclusive" primate archaeology will not only benefit the study of primate evolution in its own right but will aid conservation efforts by increasing our understanding of changes in primate-environment interactions over time.},

 abstract = {The evolutionary origins of deception and its functional role in our species is a major focus of research in the science of human origins. Several hypotheses have been proposed for its evolution, often packaged under either the Social Brain Hypothesis, which emphasizes the role that the evolution of our social systems may have played in scaffolding our cognitive traits, and the Foraging Brain Hypothesis, which emphasizes how changes in the human dietary niche were met with subsequent changes in cognition to facilitate foraging of difficult-to-acquire foods. Despite substantive overlap, these hypotheses are often presented as competing schools of thought, and there have been few explicitly proposed theoretical links unifying the two. Utilizing cross-cultural data gathered from the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), we identify numerous (n = 357) examples of the application of deception toward prey across 145 cultures. By comparing similar behaviors in nonhuman animals that utilize a hunting strategy known as aggressive mimicry, we suggest a potential pathway through which the evolution of deception may have taken place. Rather than deception evolving as a tactic for deceiving conspecifics, we suggest social applications of deception in humans could have evolved from an original context of directing these behaviors toward prey. We discuss this framework with regard to the evolution of other mental traits, including language, Theory of Mind, and empathy.},

 abstract = {Classical theories, such as Bateman's principle and Trivers' parental investment theory, attempted to explain the coevolution of sexual selection and parental care through simple verbal arguments. Since then, quantitative models have demonstrated that it is rarely that simple because many non-intuitive structures and non-linear relationships are actually at play. In this study, we propose a new standard for models of mating dynamics and parental care, emphasizing the clarity and use of mathematical and probabilistic arguments, the meaning of consistency conditions, and the key role of spatial densities and the law of mass action. We used adaptive dynamics to calculate the evolutionary trajectory of the total care duration. Our results clearly show how the outcomes of parental care evolution can be diverse, depending on the quantitative balance between a set of dynamical forces arising from relevant differences and conditions in the male and female populations. The intensity of sexual selection, synergy of care, care quality, and relative mortality rates during mating interactions and caring activities act as forces driving evolutionary transitions between uniparental and biparental care. Sexual selection reduces the care duration of the selected sex, uniparental care evolves in the sex that offers the higher care quality, higher mortality during mating interactions of one sex leads to more care by that sex, and higher mortality during caring activities of one sex favours the evolution of uniparental care in the other sex. Both synergy and higher overall mortality during mating interactions can stabilize biparental care when sexual selection reduces the care duration of the selected sex. We discuss how the interaction between these forces influences the evolution of care patterns, and how sex ratios can vary and be interpreted in these contexts. We also propose new directions for future developments of our integrative model, creating new comparable analyses that share the same underlying assumptions and dynamical frameworks.},

 abstract = {Consumption of animal-sourced food is an important factor in broadening the diet of early hominins, promoting brain and body growth, and increasing behavioural complexity. However, whether early hominins obtained animal food by scavenging or hunting large mammals remains debated. Sabre-toothed felids have been proposed to facilitate the expansion of early Homo out of Africa into Europe 1.4–0.8 Ma by creating a niche for scavengers in Eurasia as the carcasses abandoned by these felids still contained abundant edible resources. In contrast, it has been argued that the niche for a large scavenger was already occupied in Eurasia by the giant hyena, preventing hominins from utilising this resource. This study shows that sabre-toothed felids generated carcasses rich in edible resources and that hominins were capable of competing with giant hyenas for this resource. The simulation experiments showed that maintaining an optimum group size is essential for the success of the hominin scavenging strategy. Early hominins could outcompete giant hyenas only if they could successfully dispute carcasses with them. Thus, in the presence of a strong competitor, passive scavenging is essentially the same as confrontational scavenging.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is characterized as an interval sport in which the training program focuses on enhancing both aerobic and anaerobic capacities. Therefore, strategies targeting the intestinal microbiome may be beneficial for MMA athletes. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation may amplify the positive effects of certain bacterial strains. We previously demonstrated that the combined of probiotics and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation improved the lactate utilization ratio, total work, and average power achieved during anaerobic tests in MMA. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether combined probiotic and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> ingestion can modify the composition of the gut microbiome and epithelial cell permeability, influence the inflammatory response, and ultimately enhance aerobic capacity.
Methods: A 4-week clinical trial was conducted with 23 male MMA athletes randomly assigned to either the probiotic + vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (PRO + VIT D) group or the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group (VIT D). The trial employed a double-blind, placebo-controlled design and involved measurements of serum inflammatory markers, gut microbiome composition, epithelial cell permeability, and aerobic performance.
Results: After 4-week of supplementation, we found a significantly lower concentration of calprotectin in the PRO + VIT D group (34.79 ± 24.38 mmol/L) compared to the value before (69.50 ± 46.91) supplementation (<i>p</i> = 0.030), augmentation of beta diversity after the intervention in the PRO + VIT D group (<i>p</i> = 0.0005) and an extended time to exhaustion to 559.00 ± 68.99; compared to the value before (496.30 ± 89.98; <i>p</i> = 0.023) after combined probiotic and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in MMA athletes. No effect was observed in the VIT D group.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that combined treatment of probiotics and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may cause alterations in alpha and beta diversity and the composition of the gut microbiota in MMA athletes. We observed an improvement in epithelial cell permeability and an extended time to exhaustion during exercise in MMA athletes following a 4-week combined probiotic and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment.},

 abstract = {The western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>, lives worldwide in approximately 102 million managed hives but also wild throughout much of its native and introduced range. Despite the global importance of <i>A. mellifera</i> as a crop pollinator, wild colonies have received comparatively little attention in the scientific literature and basic information regarding their density and abundance is scattered. Here, we review 40 studies that have quantified wild colony density directly (<i>n</i> = 33) or indirectly using genetic markers (<i>n</i> = 7) and analyse data from 41 locations worldwide to identify factors that influence wild colony density. We also compare the density of wild and managed colonies at a regional scale using data on managed colonies from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Wild colony densities varied from 0.1 to 24.2/km<sup>2</sup> and were significantly lower in Europe (average of 0.26/km<sup>2</sup>) than in Northern America (1.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Oceania (4.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Latin America (6.7/km<sup>2</sup>) and Africa (6.8/km<sup>2</sup>). Regional differences were not significant after controlling for both temperature and survey area, suggesting that cooler climates and larger survey areas may be responsible for the low densities reported in Europe. Managed colony densities were 2.2/km<sup>2</sup> in Asia, 1.2/km<sup>2</sup> in Europe, 0.2/km<sup>2</sup>, in Northern America, 0.2/km<sup>2</sup> in Oceania, 0.5/km<sup>2</sup> in Latin America and 1/km<sup>2</sup> in Africa. Wild colony densities exceeded those of managed colonies in all regions except Europe and Asia. Overall, there were estimated to be between two and three times as many wild colonies as managed worldwide. More wild colony surveys, particularly in Asia and South America, are needed to assess the relative density of wild and managed colonies at smaller spatial scales.},

 abstract = {Chimpanzees regularly hunt and consume prey smaller than themselves. It seems therefore likely that early hominins also consumed small vertebrate meat before they started using and producing stone tools. Research has focused on cut marks and large ungulates, but there is a small body of work that has investigated the range of bone modifications produced on small prey by chimpanzee mastication that, by analogy, can be used to identify carnivory in pre-stone tool hominins. Here, we review these works along with behavioral observations and other neo-taphonomic research. Despite some equifinality with bone modifications produced by baboons and the fact that prey species used in experiments seldom are similar to the natural prey of chimpanzees, we suggest that traces of chimpanzee mastication are sufficiently distinct from those of other predators that they can be used to investigate mastication of vertebrate prey by early hominins.},

@article{pub.1165207085,
 abstract = {Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a class of rare hematological malignancies that result in the overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. These malignancies result in increased cytokine production and inflammation, which correlate with worsened symptom burden and prognosis. Other than bone marrow transplantation, there is no cure for myeloproliferative neoplasms. As such, treatments focus on reducing thrombotic risk, inflammation, and symptom burden. Because current pharmacological treatments carry significant side effects, there is a need to explore low-risk therapies that may modulate inflammation and alleviate symptom burden. One potential way to achieve this is adherence to a Mediterranean (MED) diet, which is rich in anti-inflammatory foods, reduces inflammatory biomarkers, and beneficially alters the gut microbiome. We performed a 15-week clinical trial of 28 individuals with MPN who were randomized to dietary counseling based on either a Mediterranean diet or standard U.S. Guidelines for Americans. Our primary objective was to determine whether MPN patients could adopt a Mediterranean eating pattern when supported with dietician counseling. As exploratory endpoints, we investigated the impact of diet and inflammation on the gut microbiome. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we found that microbiome diversity and composition were stable throughout the study duration in both cohorts. Furthermore, we discovered significant differences in the microbiomes between MPN subtypes, such as increased beta-dispersion in subjects with myelofibrosis. Lastly, we found several significant correlations between the abundance of multiple bacterial taxa and cytokine levels. Together, this study provides insight into the interaction between diet, inflammation, and the gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome serves as an interface between the host and the diet. Diet and the gut microbiome both play important roles in managing inflammation, which is a key aspect of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Studies have shown that a Mediterranean (MED) diet can reduce inflammation. Therefore, we longitudinally characterized the gut microbiomes of MPN patients in response to Mediterranean or standard 2020 US Guidelines for Americans dietary counseling to determine whether there were microbiome-associated changes in inflammation. We did not find significant changes in the gut microbiome associated with diet, but we did find several associations with inflammation. This research paves the way for future studies by identifying potential mechanistic targets implicated in inflammation within the MPN gut microbiome.},

A total of 12 db/db mice were randomly divided into model (MOD), high-dose CG (CGH), and control (CON) groups. The CON and MOD groups received distilled water by gavage for 8 weeks. Whereas, the CGH group received an alcohol extract of CG at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day. Results showed that CG can reduce blood lipid levels. It change the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and increase the relative abundances of Muribaculaceae, Prevotellaceae, <i>Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum</i>, Bacteroidaceae in db/db mice as well. LC-MS metabolomics results showed that CG adjusted the serum BA levels. The results reduced the levels of primary BAs, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The results decreased the primary BA/secondary BA (PSA/SBA) ratio in db/db mice. Correlation analysis showed that the abundances of <i>Bifidobacterium_pseudolongum</i> and Bacteroidaceae were positively correlated with acetic acid level and negatively correlated with ursocholic acid (UCA), α-muricholic acid (αMCA), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol levels (TC), indicating an interaction between the intestinal microbiota and serum BAs. CG may play a positive role in the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and BAs in lipid metabolism.},

While both the critics and defenders of markets acknowledge that markets can and do substantially and undeniably increase the material wealth of nations and improve people's lives materially, the dominant view within this academic debate and the social discourse around it is that markets can and often do corrupt the moral values of the people whose lives they touched. Interestingly, the topic has been underexplored empirically and it is possible to discuss the morality of markets quantitatively and qualitatively. In this article, we survey the quantitative economic literature on prosocial behavior as it relates to the market, its values, its actors and their interactions. While the evidence does not uniformly nor definitively tip the scale to a side of the debate, the bulk of the evidence suggests that markets, by and large, encourage prosocial attitudes and promote prosocial behavior.},

We aimed to investigate the association between taste preferences and MCI and the role of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) in this association. The study included older adults, aged 65-90 years, with normal cognitive function at baseline who were enrolled in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) from 2008 to 2018. MCI was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and multivariable Cox regression models were applied. Among 6423 participants, 2534 (39·45 %) developed MCI with an incidence rate of 63·12 - per 1000 person-years. Compared with individuals with insipid taste, those preferring sweetness or spiciness had a higher MCI risk, while saltiness was associated with a lower risk. This association was independent of objective dietary patterns and was more pronounced among urban residents preferring sweetness and illiterate participants preferring spiciness. Notably, among sweet-liking individuals, those with one CMD experienced a significant detrimental effect, and those with co-occurring CMD had a higher incidence rate of MCI. Additionally, regional variations were observed: sweetness played a significant role in regions known for sweet cuisine, while the significance of spiciness as a risk factor diminishes in regions where it is commonly preferred. Our findings emphasize the role of subjective taste preferences in protecting cognitive function and highlight regional variations. Target strategies should focus on assisting individuals with CMD to reduce excessive sweetness intake and simultaneously receiving treatment for CMD to safeguard cognitive function.},

 abstract = {The Epivillafranchian and the transition to the Galerian (1.2–0.9 Ma) was a period marked by environmental fluctuations and faunal turnover. Homo arrived into Europe around 1.4 Ma. ago, and was established in Iberia during the Epivillafranchian, as evidenced by the oldest sites with hominin fossils located in the Iberian Peninsula. The Iberian ecosystems offered a variety of trophic resources to hominins, including the opportunity to scavenge carcasses of large ungulates killed by a diverse predatory guild, especially due to the presence of two sabre-toothed cats. It has been claimed that the presence of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, a strong competitor for carrion, prevented hominins from exploiting abandoned carcasses as a reliable meat and fat resource. However, computer simulation experiments suggest that the coexistence of P. brevirostris and hominins competing for carrion was ecologically viable in the Epivillafranchian. Nevertheless, the faunal turnover of the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition drastically changed the composition of the large carnivore fauna. The changes include the extinction of the sabre-toothed felid Megantereon, frequently considered a key provider of partially consumed carcasses, and the demise of the hyperscavenger P. brevirostris. All these changes modified the ecological scenario and the opportunities for hominins and other facultative scavengers. Computer simulation experiments using the agent-based model SCAVCOMP-ABM are used here to evaluate the viability of the coexistence of hominins and giant hyenas in the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition. Different ecological scenarios defined by the composition of the predatory guild, ecosystem productivity, and competition pressure from other scavengers are evaluated. Results suggest that hominins and giant hyenas could coexist during the Epivillafranchian with different carnivore guilds, but a disruption of the scavenging niche likely occurred in the transition to the Galerian, coinciding with the extinction of P. brevirostris. A low ecosystem productivity during the cold intervals, maintenance of a high competition for carrion with other facultative scavengers, and a hypothetical social behaviour of the sabre-toothed cat Homotherium latidens appear as key factors to explain the changes in the scavenger guild at the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition.},

 abstract = {Abstract In geoarchaeological studies, there is an issue with distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic signals in pedological paleoarchives. With the pedostratigraphy of the Upper Paleolithic site of Kostenki 14, this issue is reflected by problems with the determination of features of pedogenic and pyrogenic processes. This issue was addressed by means of a thorough analysis of the magnetic properties of paleosols accompanied by micromorphological observations. Most of the humic samples were shown to be a result of pedogenesis, but two samples (a Paleolithic hearth sample and a sample from paleosol IIc) had features of intensely burnt material. The difference in the typical intensity of large‐scale (natural or human‐induced) and local‐scale anthropogenic fire allowed for suggesting that the magnetic properties of the burnt sample were the result of an anthropogenically controlled fire event, that is, a hearth. This study shows that the magnetic properties of paleosols can be used to differentiate anthropogenic activity, in particular—burning, from pedogenic processes. This indicator is especially helpful in finding disturbed combustion features when the hearth structure is lost. This methodology used to demonstrate the local human‐induced pyrogenic effect at the Upper Paleolithic site can contribute to the discussion of the niche construction effect of human activities in the Pleistocene.},

Proposed mechanisms include dietary shifts such as cooking. Importantly, though, any new food source must have been exploitable by hominids with brains a third the size of modern humans’. Here, we propose the initial metabolic trigger of hominid brain expansion was the consumption of externally fermented foods. We define “external fermentation” as occurring outside the body, as opposed to the internal fermentation in the gut. External fermentation could increase the bioavailability of macro- and micronutrients while reducing digestive energy expenditure and is supported by the relative reduction of the human colon. We discuss the explanatory power of our hypothesis and survey external fermentation practices across human cultures to demonstrate its viability across a range of environments and food sources. We close with suggestions for empirical tests.},

 abstract = {Abstract  This paper examines preverbal clitic clusters in the Tanzanian Rift Valley, an area of high linguistic diversity with representatives of the Bantu, Cushitic, and Nilotic families, as well as Sandawe (possibly a distant member of the Khoi-Kwadi family), and the language isolate Hadza. An earlier work (Kießling, Roland, Maarten Mous & Derek Nurse. 2008. The Tanzanian Rift Valley area. In Bernd Heine & Derek Nurse (eds.), A linguistic geography of Africa , 186–227. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) identified preverbal clitic clusters as a widespread feature across many languages of the Rift Valley, and posited the preverbal clitic cluster as a feature characteristic of a ‘Tanzanian Rift Valley Area’. The current paper provides further detail on preverbal clitic clusters across the languages of the region and examines possible routes of development for these structures. From this analysis, the picture that emerges is complex: contact scenarios cannot be restricted to ones in which West Rift Cushitic or its predecessor languages are the only models for the development of a preverbal clitic cluster and, in the case of Sandawe (and perhaps the Datooga varieties), it appears as if the development of a preverbal clitic cluster cannot be linked to contact at all. In terms of what this means for the ‘areality’ of the Tanzanian Rift Valley, this paper forgoes discussions about geographical delineation or arguments for or against a ‘Tanzanian Rift Valley Area’ in favour of highlighting the individual historical events (c.f. Campbell, Lyle. 2017. Why is it so hard to define a linguistic area? In Raymond Hickey (ed.), The Cambridge handbook of areal linguistics , 19–39. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) that may have given rise to preverbal clitic clusters in the languages of our sample, as well as encouraging continued investigation into the nature of these histories, both from a linguistic and interdisciplinary perspective. },

 abstract = {Carcass butchery is a culturally mediated behavior that reflects the technological, social, economic, and ecological factors that influence human diet and foodways. Butchery behavior can thus reveal a great deal about the lives of past peoples. Actualism provides a critical link between the dynamics of carcass butchery and the static remains of the archaeological record. This study provides an overview of actualistic butchery studies in zooarchaeology over the past century and a half. A systematic search through the English literature identified a total of 236 such studies published between 1860 and 2021. Thematic analysis revealed several trends. The most common themes have been the identification of signature criteria for different taphonomic effectors, the use of butchery traces to characterize the nature of human intervention with carcasses, and the documentation of butchery in an ethnoarchaeological context. Methodologically, the bulk of this research has focused on the butchery of large bovids with lithic implements, largely as a means to explore Paleolithic subsistence. Actualistic approaches will benefit from (1) additional work with non-bovid taxa and with other tool raw materials, (2) applications to broader anthropological issues, and (3) a concerted effort to replicate existing studies and design future studies with replication in mind.},

 abstract = {Water is always linked to the productive capacity of human beings and to ecosystems’ well-being, livelihoods, and sustained development. It can also have destructive impacts on societies and ecosystems when there is too much water (flood), too little water (drought and water scarcity), or poor quality (polluted) water. Water security is a strategy that defines the dynamic and essential societal goal of water policy and water management, whereby the productive potential of water is enhanced and its destructive impact is limited. This chapter will discuss the magnitude of water security, the causes of water insecurity in Africa, and its influence on liver and gastrointestinal tract diseases. The chapter begins by defining the water security and the trial done in African countries to determine the water security in each country. The chapter discusses the current situation of water security in Africa, types and causes of water scarcity, and challenges that face achieving water security there besides highlighting the magnitude of the problem and its impact on the liver and gut health in Africa. The chapter addresses the impact of climate change in increasing the problem of water security in Africa and reviews in detail the health consequences due to the impacts of climate change including the increase of the chemical and biological pollutants risk. In conclusion, approaches to enhance water security should be suggested and executed like investments in institutions, improving water quality management, reducing inequalities in water security, investments in information flows, investments in infrastructure, consideration of scales, and improving climate resilience of water and sanitation services. African authorities have a stake in anticipating the risks of water-borne diseases and acting speedily and effectively because crises related to water will arise in Africa when African leaders lack the capacity to handle them.},

 abstract = {IMPORTANCE: On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), feed shortages are common due to cold environmental conditions and the short growing season of crops. Therefore, effective preservation, such as the ensiling of local forage, is becoming increasingly important to balance the seasonal imbalance between the forage supply and the nutritional needs of domestic animals in this area. However, the structure of the microbial community of the forage, which is influenced by climatic conditions such as altitude differences, has a major impact on the fermentation quality and microbial succession of the ensiled forage. Therefore, we investigated microbial community dynamics, co-occurrence, functional shifts, and natural fermentation profiles of <i>Elymus nutans</i> silage as a function of altitudinal gradients. Results show that silage from Chenduo at higher elevations has better fermentation quality and higher abundance of <i>Lacticaseibacillus</i> and <i>Levilactobacillus</i> than ensiled forage from other regions. This work may contribute to guiding for silage production in QTP.},

Honey hunters in different parts of Africa use different calls to communicate with greater honeyguides (<i>Indicator indicator</i>) that lead them to bees' nests. We show experimentally that honeyguides in Tanzania and Mozambique discriminate among honey hunters' calls, responding more readily to local than to foreign calls. This was not explained by variation in sound transmission and instead suggests that honeyguides learn local human signals.

 abstract = {Behavioural economics works toward more realistic accounts of economic action, which includes efforts to endogenise the ‘social’. In its social strand, behavioural economics is specifically concerned with fair outcomes in interactive economic games, which are explained by reference to social preferences, norms and institutions. While these concepts also matter to scholars in political economy and socioeconomics, behavioural economists seek to go further in specifying their behavioural and evolutionary foundations. This article critically evaluates evolutionary research strategies in the social strand of behavioural economics, which aim to uncover the evolutionary origins of fairness in economic experiments. Representatives of this field offer new support for the classical idea of ‘doux commerce’, or the civilising function of markets, by suggesting that cooperation with strangers in economic exchange fundamentally shaped the course of human evolution. Their explanatory framework is gene-culture coevolution, which covers long timespans of human existence. However, the case for the virtuous effect of markets in human prehistory remains ambiguous: basic concepts, causal mechanisms, and timescales of analysis vary to an extent that it is possible to arrive at very different projections of ‘doux commerce’ into the past. With regard to the present, these fulfil a similar function in naturalising market moralities.},

 abstract = {Abstract Archaeology and cultural evolution theory both predict that environmental variation and population size drive the likelihood of inventions (via individual learning) and their conversion to population-wide innovations (via social uptake). We use the case study of the adoption of the bow and arrow in the Great Basin to infer how patterns of cultural variation, invention, and innovation affect investment in new technologies over time and the conditions under which we could predict cultural innovation to occur. Using an agent-based simulation to investigate the conditions that manifest in the innovation of technology, we find the following: (1) increasing ecological variation results in a greater reliance on individual learning, even when this decreases average fitness due to the costs of learning; (2) decreasing population size increases variability in the types of learning strategies that individuals use; among smaller populations drift-like processes may contribute to randomization in interpopulation cultural diffusion; (3) increasing the mutation rate affects the variability in learning patterns at different rates of environmental variation; and (4) increasing selection pressure increases the reliance on social learning. We provide an open-source R script for the model and encourage others to use it to test additional hypotheses.
Resume Tanto la arqueología como la teoría de la evolución cultural pronostican que la variación ambiental y el tamaño de la población impulsan la probabilidad de invención (a través del aprendizaje individual) y su conversión en innovaciones para toda la población (a través de la aceptación social). Utilizamos el estudio de caso de la adopción del arco y la flecha en la Gran Cuenca para inferir cómo los patrones de variación, invención e innovación culturales afectan la inversión en nuevas tecnologías a lo largo del tiempo y las condiciones bajo las cuales podríamos pronosticar que ocurrirá innovación cultural. Exploramos este estudio de caso con una simulación basada en agentes para investigar las condiciones que se manifiestan en la innovación tecnológica. Encontramos que (1) Un incremento en la variación ecológica da como resultado una mayor dependencia del aprendizaje individual, incluso cuando esto disminuye la aptitud promedio debido a los costos del aprendizaje, (2) La disminución del tamaño de la población aumenta la variabilidad en los tipos de estrategias de aprendizaje que usan los individuos; entre poblaciones más pequeñas, los procesos tipo deriva pueden contribuir a la aleatorización en la difusión cultural entre poblaciones, (3) Un incremento en la tasa de mutación afecta la variabilidad en los patrones de aprendizaje en diferentes tasas de variación ambiental, y (4) Un incremento en la presión de selección aumenta la dependencia del aprendizaje social.

El Sidrón has many cannibalized Neanderthal bones but few faunal remains, the Llonín cave shows short Neanderthal occupations, the Mousterian of La Viña yielded few faunal remains, and the three Mousterian levels of Cova Eirós were also short occupations. In this work, we present the zooarchaeological and taphonomical analyses from the Mousterian Level XV of Sopeña (Onís, Asturias), very rich in faunal remains, aiming to shed light on the Neanderthal subsistence on the western part of northern Spain. Faunal remains from Sopeña Level XV appear very modified by neanderthal actions. They did exploit a variety of ungulates from diverse ecosystems, both high mountains and river valleys, displaying the great versatility and adaptability in their subsistence strategies.},

 abstract = {Questions on early sapiens cognition, the cognitive abilities of our ancestors, are intriguing but notoriously hard to tackle. Leaving no hard traces in the archeological record, these abilities need to be inferred from indirect evidence, informed by our understanding of present-day cognition. Most of such attempts acknowledge the role that culture, as a faculty, has played for human evolution, but they underrate or even disregard the role of distinct cultural traditions and the ensuing diversity, both in present-day humans and as a dimension of past cognition. We argue that culture has exerted a profound impact on human cognition from the start in a dual manner: It scaffolds cognition through both development and evolution, and it thereby continually diversifies the form and content of human thinking. To unveil early sapiens cognition and retrace its evolutionary trajectories, this cognitive diversity must be considered. We present two strategies to achieve this: large-scale extrapolation and phylogenetic comparison. The former aims at filtering out diversity to determine what is basic and universal versus culturally shaped (illustrated for theory of mind abilities). The latter capitalizes on the diversity to reconstruct evolutionary trajectories (illustrated for religious beliefs). The two methods, in combination, advance our understanding of the cognitive abilities of our early sapiens ancestors and of how these abilities emerged and evolved. To conclude, we discuss the implications of this approach for our insights into early cognition itself and its scientific investigation.

 abstract = {Abstract Archaeological studies of early weaponry have relied for decades on ethnographic parallels—whether from ethnohistorical accounts, ethnographic literature, or from objects studied in museum collections. While such accounts and collected objects provided key data in the past, including of morphometrics and functionality, few studies have explored the quality of such data. In this paper, we critically assess a dominant theoretical paradigm, namely the utility of ethnographic collections to assess Pleistocene archaeological material. Our focus is how ethnographic spear morphometrics are used to propose delivery methods of archaeological weapons. We discuss the archaeological significance of early spears, and the role that ethnography has played in interpreting them. We provide new morphometric data of ethnographic wooden spears, which have been used analogically to assess the earliest archaeological hunting tools. We systematically collected data from ethnographic collections of wooden spears in five museums in the UK and Australia including mass, length, diameters and point of balance, alongside any recorded information on provenance and use. Older datasets, as well as the data in this paper, are limited due to collection bias and a lack of detailed museum records. By subjecting the new data to statistical analyses, we find that with a few exceptions morphometrics are not reliable predictors of delivery as thrusting or hand-thrown spears (javelins). Prevalent hypotheses linking variables such as mass, tip design, or maximum diameter with delivery are unsupported by our results. However, the descriptive statistics provided may remain useful as a means of comparative data for archaeological material. We conclude that using simple morphometrics to parse weapon delivery has had a drag effect on forming new and interesting hypotheses about early weapons.},

 abstract = {The social punishment (SP) of norm violations has received much attention across multiple disciplines. However, current models of SP fail to consider the role of motivational processes, and none can explain the observed behavioral and neuropsychological differences between the two recognized forms of SP: second-party punishment (2PP) and third-party punishment (3PP). After reviewing the literature giving rise to the current models of SP, we propose a unified model of SP which integrates general psychological descriptions of decision-making as a confluence of affect, cognition, and motivation, with evidence that SP is driven by two main factors: the amount of harm (assessed primarily in the salience network) and the norm violator's intention (assessed primarily in the default-mode and central-executive networks). We posit that motivational differences between 2PP and 3PP, articulated in mesocorticolimbic pathways, impact final SP by differentially impacting the assessments of harm and intention done in these domain-general large-scale networks. This new model will lead to a better understanding of SP, which might even improve forensic, procedural, and substantive legal practices.},

First, it is demonstrated that temporal adverbial clauses tend to be encoded with conjunctions and converbs in the database. A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test shows that ‘after’, ‘before’, and ‘until’ meanings are strongly and similarly associated with monofunctional clause-linking devices cross-linguistically. ‘While’ meanings are ambivalent, and ‘when’ meanings are strongly encoded with polyfunctional clause-linking devices. Second, the paper also explores the polyfunctionality patterns of temporal adverbial clause-linking devices. While the semantic polyfunctionality patterns attested in the present research align, for the most part, with those documented by other typological studies, there are a number of patterns that have been neglected in the typological literature, such as the polyfunctionality pattern between ‘while’ and ‘without’, between ‘after’ and ‘lest’, and between ‘before’ and ‘lest’, among others.},

This study applies novel strontium isotope methodologies that have reliably predicted philopatry and dispersal patterns in chimpanzees and other modern primates to previously published strontium isotope ratios (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) of two South African hominins, Australopithecus africanus and Australopithecus robustus. In this study, the difference or 'offset' was calculated between the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr of each fossil tooth compared to local bioavailable <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr as defined by cluster analysis of modern plant isotope ratios. Large teeth (presumably belonging to males) have low offsets from local <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr proxies, while small teeth (presumably from females) have greater offsets from local <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr proxies. This supports previous conclusions of male philopatry and female dispersal in both A. africanus and A. robustus. Furthermore, A. robustus shows more extreme differences between presumed males and females compared to A. africanus. This is analogous to differences seen in modern olive baboons compared to chimpanzees and suggests that A. africanus may have had a larger home range than A. robustus. Neither hominin species has <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr consistent with riparian habitat preferences despite the demonstrated presence of riparian habitats in South Africa at the time.},

This series of studies is now under way and will be presented part by part in a series of papers. The present paper surveys the post-war history (second half of the 20th century) of a rather introverted and fossilized special branch of comparative studies that has been arbitrarily focusing on a forced comparison of just Semitic and Egyptian, which was split off for more than a whole century by now from mainstream Semito-Hamitic studies at the end of the 19th century.},

 abstract = {Although social interactions are known to drive pathogen transmission, the contributions of socially transmissible host-associated mutualists and commensals to host health and disease remain poorly explored. We use the concept of the social microbiome-the microbial metacommunity of a social network of hosts-to analyze the implications of social microbial transmission for host health and disease. We investigate the contributions of socially transmissible microbes to both eco-evolutionary microbiome community processes (colonization resistance, the evolution of virulence, and reactions to ecological disturbance) and microbial transmission-based processes (transmission of microbes with metabolic and immune effects, inter-specific transmission, transmission of antibiotic-resistant microbes, and transmission of viruses). We consider the implications of social microbial transmission for communicable and non-communicable diseases and evaluate the importance of a socially transmissible component underlying canonically non-communicable diseases. The social transmission of mutualists and commensals may play a significant, under-appreciated role in the social determinants of health and may act as a hidden force in social evolution.},

Remains of these two species are extremely rare in Paleoeskimo sites, probably because of the lack of a sophisticated whale-hunting technology. While white whale and narwhal remains are more common in Neoeskimo sites, they nevertheless make up relatively insignificant portions of the total fauna] assemblages. Since Neoeskimos possessed a sophisticated whaling technology, the problem becomes one of explaining the general paucity of such remains. Four potential factors are addressed: a) taphonomy, b) processing and transport, c) lack of appropriate archaeological data and d) lack of these two species in the diet of Inuit during prehistoric and early historic times.},

 abstract = {Abstract Fermentation products released by the gut microbiota provide energy and important regulatory functions to the host. Yet, little quantitative information is available on the metabolite exchange between the microbiota and the human host, and thus the effective doses of fermentation products. Here, we introduce an integrative framework combining experimental characterization of major gut bacteria with a quantitative analysis of human digestive physiology to put numbers on this exchange and its dependence on diet and microbiota composition. From the complex carbohydrates fueling microbiota growth, we find most carbon ends up in fermentation products which are largely utilized by the host. This harvest of mixed fermentation products varies strongly with diet, from between 100-700 mmol/day within the US population to up to 1300 for the Hadza people of Tanzania. Accordingly, fermentation products cover between 2% and 12% of the daily energy demand of human hosts, substantially less than the 21±4% estimated for laboratory mice. In contrast, microbiota composition has little impact on the total daily harvest but determines the harvest of specific fermentation products. Butyrate, known for promoting epithelial health, shows the biggest variation. Our framework thus identifies and quantifies major factors driving the metabolic interactions and exchange of information between microbiota and host, crucial to mechanistically dissect the role of the microbiota in health and disease.},

 abstract = {Although male and female mammals differ in biological traits and functional needs, the contribution of this sexual dimorphism to variations in gut bacteria and fungi (gut microbiota) in relation to habitat type has not been fully examined. To understand whether the combination of sex and habitat affects gut microbiota variation, we analyzed 40 fecal samples of wild yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) living in contrasting habitat types (intact, well-protected vs. fragmented, less protected forests) in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. Sex determination was performed using the marker genes SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) and DDX3X-DDX3Y (DEAD-Box Helicase 3). Samples were attributed to 34 individuals (19 females and 15 males) belonging to five social groups. Combining the results of sex determination with two amplicon sequencing datasets on bacterial (V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene) and fungal (ITS2) gut communities, we found that overall, baboon females had a significantly higher gut bacterial richness compared to males. Beta diversity estimates indicated that bacterial composition was significantly different between males and females, and this was true for individuals from both well- and less protected forests. Our results highlight the combined role of sex and habitat type in shaping variation in gut microbial communities in wild non-human primates.},

Emerging insights into diet-microbiota interactions indicate that nutrition has a dominant influence on the composition-and metabolic output-of the intestinal microbiota, which in turn has major consequences for host immunity and inflammation. Here, we discuss recent findings that support the concept that dietary effects on microbiota-derived metabolites potently alter immune responses in health and disease. We discuss how specific dietary components and metabolites can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory in a context- and tissue-dependent manner during infection, chronic inflammation, and cancer. Together, these studies emphasize the influence of diet-microbiota crosstalk on immune regulation that will have a significant impact on precision nutrition approaches and therapeutic interventions for managing inflammation, infection, and cancer immunotherapy.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are crucial for digesting glycans, but bioinformatics tools for CAZyme profiling and interpretation of substrate preferences in microbial community data are lacking. To address this, we developed a CAZyme profiler (Cayman) and a hierarchical substrate annotation scheme. Leveraging these, we genomically survey CAZymes in human gut microbes (n=107,683 genomes), which suggests novel mucin-foraging species. In a subsequent meta-analysis of CAZyme repertoires in Western versus non-Western gut metagenomes (n=4,281) we find that non-Western metagenomes are richer in fibre-degrading CAZymes despite lower overall CAZyme richness. We additionally pinpoint the taxonomic drivers underlying these CAZyme community shifts. A second meta-analysis comparing colorectal cancer patients (CRC) to controls (n=1,998) shows that CRC metagenomes are deprived of dietary fibre-targeting, but enriched in glycosaminoglycan-targeting CAZymes. A genomic analysis of co-localizing CAZyme domains predicts novel substrates for CRC-enriched CAZymes. Cayman is broadly applicable across microbial communities and freely available from https://github.com/zellerlab/cayman . },

 abstract = {Abstract The composition of the gut microbiome (GM) affects human health and varies among lifestyles. Adopting more “traditional” diets could lead to substantive and health-associated changes in the GM. However, research has focused on diets including domesticated foods. For most of our evolutionary history, humans consumed only wild foods. We explored the impact of a wild-food-only (WF) diet on the GM composition. One participant collected daily fecal samples and recorded daily food consumption over an eight-week period, the middle four weeks of which he consumed only wild foods (nuts, fruits and leafy greens, wild deer, and fish). Samples were profiled through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and the species identified by oligotyping. The WF diet altered the GM composition, and the magnitude of the changes is larger than in other diet interventions. However, no new GM taxa, including “old friends” appeared; instead, the relative proportions of already-present taxa shifted. There is a clear successional shift from the pre-, during- and post-WF diet. The GM is very sensitive to the change from a “Western” diet to a WF diet, likely reflecting the different macro- and micronutrient properties of the consumed foods.},

 abstract = {To understand dynamic interplay between the human microbiome and host during health and disease, we analyzed the microbial composition, temporal dynamics, and associations with host multi-omics, immune and clinical markers of microbiomes from four body sites in 86 participants over six years. We found that microbiome stability and individuality are body-site-specific and heavily influenced by the host. The stool and oral microbiome were more stable than the skin and nasal microbiomes, possibly due to their interaction with the host and environment. Also, we identified individual-specific and commonly shared bacterial taxa, with individualized taxa showing greater stability. Interestingly, microbiome dynamics correlated across body sites, suggesting systemic coordination influenced by host-microbial-environment interactions. Notably, insulin-resistant individuals showed altered microbial stability and associations between microbiome, molecular markers, and clinical features, suggesting their disrupted interaction in metabolic disease. Our study offers comprehensive views of multi-site microbial dynamics and their relationship with host health and disease.
Study Highlights: The stability of the human microbiome varies among individuals and body sites.Highly individualized microbial genera are more stable over time.At each of the four body sites, systematic interactions between the environment, the host and bacteria can be detected.Individuals with insulin resistance have lower microbiome stability, a more diversified skin microbiome, and significantly altered host-microbiome interactions.},

However, the majority of studies have focused on populations in high-income countries rather than in developing regions where HIV burden is greatest. To better understand the impact of HIV on fecal microbiota globally, we compare the fecal microbial community of individuals in the U.S., Uganda, and Botswana. We identify significant bacterial taxa alterations with both treated and untreated HIV infection with a high degree of uniqueness in each cohort. HIV-associated taxa alterations are also significantly different between populations that report men who have sex with men (MSM) behavior and non-MSM populations. Additionally, while we find that HIV infection is consistently associated with higher soluble markers of immune activation, most specific bacterial taxa associated with these markers in each region are not shared and none are shared across all three geographic locations in our study. Our findings demonstrate that HIV-associated changes in fecal microbiota are overall distinct among geographical locations and sexual behavior groups, although a small number of taxa shared between pairs of geographic locations warrant further investigation, highlighting the importance of considering host context to fully assess the impact of the gut microbiome on human health and disease.},

The persistence of this correlation, and its similarity to correlations between income and life satisfaction within countries, could lead to the impression that high levels of life satisfaction can only be achieved in wealthy societies. However, global polls have typically overlooked small-scale, nonindustrialized societies, which can provide an alternative test of the consistency of this relationship. Here, we present results from a survey of 2,966 members of Indigenous Peoples and local communities among 19 globally distributed sites. We find that high average levels of life satisfaction, comparable to those of wealthy countries, are reported for numerous populations that have very low monetary incomes. Our results are consistent with the notion that human societies can support very satisfying lives for their members without necessarily requiring high degrees of monetary wealth.},

In the extreme conditions encountered during human spaceflight, there is a need to understand human functioning and response in a more rigorous theoretically informed way. Current models of human performance in space-relevant environments and human space science are often operationally focused, with emphasis on acute physiological or behavioral outcomes. However, integrating current perspectives in human biology allows for a more holistic and complete understanding of how humans function over a range of time in an extreme environment. Here, we show how the use of evolution-informed frameworks (i.e., models of life history theory to organize the adaptive pressures of spaceflight and biocultural perspectives) coupled with the use of mixed-methodological toolkits can shape models that better encompass the scope of biobehavioral human adjustment to long-duration space travel and extra-terrestrial habitation. Further, we discuss how we can marry human biology perspectives with the rigorous programmatic structures developed for spaceflight to model other unknown and nascent extremes.},

Though Kaunas Tatars didn’t accomplish much in spheres of culture and education, they managed to build a new mosque in Kaunas this way leaving their mark. The main goal of Kaunas Tatar community was creating religious central institution. In 1925 in Vilnius polish Tatar community established institution of Mufti. Kaunas Tatars tried to establish similar organizations thorough all interwar period. Sadly, the conflicts between Muslim parishes in Lithuania constantly stopped this process. Kaunas Tatar Association tried to become dominating institution in Lithuanian Muslim community. This initiative was supported by Lithuanian Government but Tatars of Raižiai and Vinkšnupiai parishes wanted to function independently.
Po Pirmojo pasaulinio karo Lietuvos totoriai liko be centrinės valdžios. Jie turėjo reorganizuotis ir atkurti savo parapijas. Kauno totoriai daug nepasiekė totorių švietimo ir kultūros srityse, tačiau pastatė mūrinę mečetę ir taip laikinojoje sostinėje paliko savo pėdsaką. Pagrindinis Kauno totorių tikslas – sukurti organizaciją, kuri vienytų visus Lietuvos totorius. 1925 m. Vilniuje Lenkijos totoriai įsteigė religinį centrą – Muftiatą. Kauno totoriai taip pat bandė kurti religines organizacijas. Deja, nuolatiniai parapijų konfliktai stabdė centralizacijos procesą. Kauno totorių draugija norėjo būti dominuojanti jėga Lietuvos totorių gyvenime, tačiau, nors ir turėjusi Lietuvos vyriausybės palaikymą, sulaukė didelio pasipriešinimo iš Raižių ir Vinkšnupių parapijų totorių, kurie norėjo veikti nepriklausomi.},

 abstract = {Increasing levels of industrialization have been associated with changes in gut microbiome structure and loss of features thought to be crucial for maintaining gut ecological balance. The stability of gut microbial communities over time within individuals seems to be largely affected by these changes but has been overlooked among transitioning populations from low- to middle-income countries. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to characterize the temporal dynamics in gut microbiomes of 24 individuals living an urban non-industrialized lifestyle in the Brazilian Amazon. We further contextualized our data with 165 matching longitudinal samples from an urban industrialized and a rural non-industrialized population. We show that gut microbiome composition and diversity have greater variability over time among non-industrialized individuals when compared to industrialized counterparts and that taxa may present diverse temporal dynamics across human populations. Enterotype classifications show that community types are generally stable over time despite shifts in microbiome structure. Furthermore, by tracking genomes over time, we show that levels of bacterial population replacements are more frequent among Amazonian individuals and that non-synonymous variants accumulate in genes associated with degradation of host dietary polysaccharides. Taken together, our results suggest that the stability of gut microbiomes is influenced by levels of industrialization and that tracking microbial population dynamics is important to understand how the microbiome will adapt to these transitions.IMPORTANCEThe transition from a rural or non-industrialized lifestyle to urbanization and industrialization has been linked to changes in the structure and function of the human gut microbiome. Understanding how the gut microbiomes changes over time is crucial to define healthy states and to grasp how the gut microbiome interacts with the host environment. Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of gut microbiomes from an urban and non-industrialized population in the Amazon, as well as metagenomic data sets from urban United States and rural Tanzania. We showed that healthy non-industrialized microbiomes experience greater compositional shifts over time compared to industrialized individuals. Furthermore, bacterial strain populations are more frequently replaced in non-industrialized microbiomes, and most non-synonymous mutations accumulate in genes associated with the degradation of host dietary components. This indicates that microbiome stability is affected by transitions to industrialization, and that strain tracking can elucidate the ecological dynamics behind such transitions.},

 abstract = {Purpose – The Covid-19 and climate change crises have increased attention to building a more circular global economy. This paper analyses the insufficiency of the linear economy growth model in a post-Covid-19 world and sheds light on the role of the sharing/collaborative economy in the post-Covid-19 socio-economic recovery.Methodology – An explanatory approach is employed to broaden the theoretical idea of the Sharing Economy (SE) as a contemporary concept by delving into the historical applications and motivations of sharing and collaborative practices in the Islamic economy and hunter-gather societies.Findings – Although contemporary sharing economy platforms are credited with the sharing economy concept, history shows that pre-modern societies have used sharing concepts to maximize efficiency in allocating resources, and collaborative consumption predates the digital economy. The paper also finds that adopting Islamic economy ideologies for social solidarity could address contemporary sharing economy models' challenges.Implications – The paper fills a gap in the literature by learning from historical sharing practices and adopting Islamic economy ideologies for social solidarity; the sharing economy could contribute significantly to building a circular global economy.Originality – By delving into the historical applications and motivations of sharing and collaborative practices in the Islamic economy and hunter-gatherer societies, this paper brings a unique perspective that is rarely studied.},

 abstract = {In tropical or subtropical areas, high temperatures and prolonged storage time usually result in poor fermentation quality, poor aerobic stability and dry matter loss of silages. This study explored the effect of heat-resistant Lactobacillus buchneri TSy1–3 (LB), Lactobacillus rhamnosus BDy3–10 (LR), and their combination (M) on the nutritional characteristics, fermentation parameters and microbiota of whole plant maize silage during long-duration ensiling in the subtropical area. The results showed that long-term ensiling naturally led to a decrease in water-soluble carbohydrate, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber concentrations. In contrast to the control treatment, LB, LR and M reduced the coliform bacteria population and the nutrient loss, while increased lactic acid bacteria population and acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations after 180 d of fermentation. Moreover, they helped to increase Lactobacillus abundance and made it still dominate the bacterial community during long-term storage. The negative/positive ratio was higher in the LR and LB treatments when compared with the control treatment, suggesting that LR and LB increased the stability of the bacterial community networks. The heat-resistant inoculants rapidly produced lactic acid to modulate the bacterial community composition during 60 d of ensiling, while generated more acetic acid and propionic acid to alter the microflora during 180 d of ensiling. This may be caused by predicted functions indicating that metabolism pathways were modulated by different inoculations and storage times. Overall, heat-resistant lactic acid bacteria improved the nutritional and fermentation quality of ensiled forage and regulated the bacterial community during long-term storage in the subtropical region.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mandibular shape is strongly influenced by biomechanics, particularly during dietary shifts that often occurred in past populations. The relationship is considered extremely complex as development of the mandible is a multifactorial process. Since cortical bone distribution is purportedly more biomechanically sensitive than external shape, comparison of its distribution in past populations can provide new input to understand this complex relationship. The present study examined the effects of geographical origin and dietary habits on the internal anatomy of the mandibular corpus and symphysis.
DESIGN: A morphometric analysis was conducted on 72 mandibles from different populations, sampled by their geographical origin and subsistence strategies. Procrustes ANOVAs were performed to test the impact of section-plane location, geographical origin, and dietary habits on the groups' shapes.
RESULTS: The specimens' geographical origin and dietary habits had a significant effect on the shapes of the sections (Generalized Goodall F-test, F = 3.2745, df = 6, 304: p < 0.001 and F = 3.7007, df = 4, 306: p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Geographical origin and dietary habits influenced the shape of the mandibular sections in our sample. These relationships become more complex when analysed in isolated sections. Indeed, this study revealed that symphysis sections could be predominantly influenced by individual variables, whereas intermediate sections of the corpus could be predominantly influenced by populational variables. Future studies could focus on specific sections to better identify the specific "rules of dependence" in each cross-section.},

 abstract = {Color naming in natural languages is not arbitrary: It reflects efficient partitions of perceptual color space [T. Regier, P. Kay, N. Khetarpal, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> <b>104</b>, 1436-1441 (2007)] modulated by the relative needs to communicate about different colors [C. Twomey, G. Roberts, D. Brainard, J. Plotkin, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> <b>118</b>, e2109237118 (2021)]. These psychophysical and communicative constraints help explain why languages around the world have remarkably similar, but not identical, mappings of colors to color terms. Languages converge on a small set of efficient representations.But languages also evolve, and the number of terms in a color vocabulary may change over time. Here we show that history, i.e. the existence of an antecedent color vocabulary, acts as a nonadaptive constraint that biases the choice of efficient solution as a language transitions from a vocabulary of size [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] terms. Moreover, as efficient vocabularies evolve to include more terms they explore a smaller fraction of all possible efficient vocabularies compared to equally sized vocabularies constructed de novo. This path dependence of the cultural evolution of color naming presents an opportunity. Historical constraints can be used to reconstruct ancestral color vocabularies, allowing us to answer long-standing questions about the evolutionary sequences of color words, and enabling us to draw inferences from phylogenetic patterns of language change.},

 abstract = {The existence of hermeneutics in the Islamic world, especially in the interpretation of the Qur’an is quite problematic. Some Muslim scholars consider hermeneutics to be inapplicable in interpreting the Qur'an. moreover, historically hermeneutics has a close relationship with the tradition of biblical understanding. However, al-Ghazali in his book Jawāhir-ul Qur'ān has introduced hermeneutics-based ta'wil. This article aims to discuss the concept of the Qur’anic sufi hermeneutics developed by Imam Al-Ghazali. This study is a library research with deductive method. The research data were analyzed using Edward Husserl's phenomenology investigation to highlight the illumination of al-Ghazali's method to reach the essence of the text. The results of the study found that the discovery of the essence of the text can be achieved by mystical intuition rather than categorical intuition. Al-Ghazali asserts that individuals who seek the spiritual path are endowed with mystical intuitive abilities. Therefore, mystical experiences and spiritual readers help to uncover the hidden layers and meanings of the Qur'an. As indicated in his interpretation of Q.S al-An'am: 76-78 about Abraham's contemplation when seeking the essence of God. According to al-Ghazali, it shows how Ibrahim uses a higher faculty than the cognitive faculties of sensory perception, creativity and reason. His interpretation of Surah al-An'am relies solely on mystical intuition and cannot be understood by anyone who is not inclined towards such an interpretation.},

 abstract = {The identification of anthropogenically-modified carnivoran bones in archaeological sites is rare in Pleistocene contexts, especially in the most ancient periods. Neanderthal groups have clearly shown a great variety of subsistence activities and the use of carnivoran resources, until rare, is also present in some archaeological sites. However, the identification of the bone surface modifications (BSM) that allow us to infer the presence of anthropogenic marks in faunal remains are usually difficult to be differentiate among other BSM. Recently, several statistical and computing techniques have been developed to differentiate among different types of BSM in an objective way. To date, the most powerful approach is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are the essential part of what is referred to as Deep Learning. In this work, ResNet50 and Inception V3 models are used through transfer learning. The algorithm architecture reaches an accuracy of >96.3% when differentiating among experimental trampling, cut and tooth marks. Once the transfer models were re-trained with the experimental BSM, they were used to classify several archaeological BSM previously identified as cut marks by human analysts. These BSM have been found on a bear ulna and on a hyena phalanx, both recovered at the Navalmaíllo Rock Shelter (Madrid, Spain). The BSM located on the hyaena phalanx have been identified as cut marks with a high probability while marks on the bear ulna are non-anthropogenic. This bone adds to the existing sample of anthropogenically-modified carnivoran elements by Neanderthal populations and hint to use of carnivore pelts by Neanderthals.},

 abstract = {Quantifying the distance between cultural groups has received substantial recent interest. A key innovation, borrowed from population genetics, is the calculation of cultural <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> (<i>CF<sub>ST</sub></i>) statistics on datasets of human culture. Measuring the variance between groups as a fraction of total variance, <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> is theoretically important in additive models of cooperation. Consistent with this, recent empirical work has confirmed that high values of pairwise <i>CF<sub>ST</sub></i> (measuring cultural distance) strongly predict unwillingness to cooperate with strangers in coordination vignettes. As applications for <i>CF<sub>ST</sub></i> increase, however, there is greater need to understand its meaning in naturalistic situations beyond additive cooperation. Focusing on games with both positive and negative frequency dependence and high-diversity, mixed equilibria, we derive a simple relationship between <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> and the evolution of group-beneficial traits across a broad spectrum of social interactions. Contrary to standard assumptions, this model shows why <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> can have both positive and <i>negative</i> marginal effects on the spread of group-beneficial traits under certain realistic conditions. These results provide broader theoretical direction for empirical applications of <i>CF<sub>ST</sub></i> in the evolutionary study of culture.},

However, evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut is scarce. We have identified ruminococcal species in the gut microbiota of human populations that assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome structures capable of degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides. One of these species, which is strongly associated with humans, likely originated in the ruminant gut and was subsequently transferred to the human gut, potentially during domestication where it underwent diversification and diet-related adaptation through the acquisition of genes from other gut microbes. Collectively, these species are abundant and widespread among ancient humans, hunter-gatherers, and rural populations but are rare in populations from industrialized societies thus indicating potential disappearance in response to the westernized lifestyle.},

The research employs a comprehensive evaluation, incorporating expert validation, small-scale testing, and field trials. Thirty-seven students were involved as research participants, with seven individuals for the pilot and 30 for the field scale tests. Meanwhile, five experts were employed to validate the designed instructional media. The instrument used to assess the feasibility of the instructional media was a questionnaire consisting of 32 items for student responses and 36 items for expert validators, with 17 points allocated to media experts and 19 to mathematics experts. The results demonstrate a high feasibility rating of 93,38%, indicating the efficacy of the Articulate Storyline 3-based learning media. Furthermore, students responded positively to the media, with an overall interest rating of 88,39%. The research also reveals a moderate increase in algebraic thinking skills, as reflected in the average n-gain index of 0,46 for small-scale testing and 0,39 for field-scale testing. The recommendations for future research include considerations for using free hosting to ease accessibility, enhancing interactivity in the presentation of teaching materials, and expanding the learning media to encompass diverse subjects aligned with students' needs.

 abstract = {As a corridor for population movement out of Africa, the southern Levant is a natural laboratory for research exploring the dynamics of the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition. Yet, the number of well-preserved sites dating to the initial millennia of the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP; ∼45-30 ka) remains limited, restricting the resolution at which we can study the biocultural and techno-typological changes evidenced across the transition. With EUP deposits dating to 45-39 ka cal BP, Mughr el-Hamamah, Jordan, offers a key opportunity to expand our understanding of EUP lifeways in the southern Levant. Mughr el-Hamamah is particularly noteworthy for its large faunal assemblage, representing the first such assemblage from the Jordan Valley. In this paper, we present results from taxonomic and taphonomic analyses of the EUP fauna from Mughr el-Hamamah. Given broader debates about shifts in human subsistence across the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition, we also assess evidence for subsistence intensification, focusing especially on the exploitation of gazelle and the use of small game. Taphonomic data suggest that the fauna was primarily accumulated by human activity. Ungulates dominate the assemblage; gazelle (Gazella sp.) is the most common taxa, followed by fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and goat (Capra sp.). Among the gazelle, juveniles account for roughly one-third of the sample. While the focus on gazelle and the frequency of juveniles are consistent with broader regional trends, evidence for the regular exploitation of marrow from gazelle phalanges suggests that the EUP occupants of Mughr el-Hamamah processed gazelle carcasses quite intensively. Yet, the overall degree of dietary intensification appears low-small game is rare and evidence for human capture of this game is more equivocal. As a whole, our results support a growing body of data showing gradual shifts in animal exploitation strategies across the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition in the southern Levant.},

 abstract = {The role of the gut microbiota in energy metabolism of the host has been established, both in overweight/obesity, as well as in undernutrition/stunting. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may predispose to stunting. The aim of this study was to compare the gut microbiota composition of stunted Indonesian children and non-stunted children between 36 and 45 months from two sites on the East Nusa Tenggara (ENT) islands. Fecal samples were collected from 100 stunted children and 100 non-stunted children in Kupang and North Kodi. The gut microbiota composition was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations were analyzed. The microbiota composition was correlated to anthropometric parameters and fecal metabolites. The phyla Bacteroidetes (Bacteroidota; q = 0.014) and Cyanobacteria (q = 0.049) were significantly higher in stunted children. Three taxa at genus levels were consistently significantly higher in stunted children at both sampling sites, namely Lachnoclostridium, Faecalibacterium and Veillonella (q < 7 * 10-4). These and 9 other taxa positively correlated to the z-score length-for-age (zlen), while 11 taxa negatively correlated with zlen. Several taxa also correlated with sanitary parameters, some of which were also significantly different between the two groups. All three fecal SCFA concentrations (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and their total were lower in stunted children compared to non-stunted children, although not significant for butyrate, indicating lower energy-extraction by the gut microbiota. Also, since SCFA have been shown to be involved in gut barrier function, barrier integrity may be affected in the stunted children. It remains to be seen if the three taxa are involved in stunting, or are changed due to e.g. differences in diet, hygiene status, or other factors. The observed differences in this study do not agree with our previous observations in children on Java, Indonesia. There are differences in infrastructure facilities such as clean water and sanitation on ENT and Java, which may contribute to the differences observed. The role of the gut microbiota in stunting therefore requires more in depth studies. Trial registration: the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number NCT05119218.},

We developed a database of IS elements coupled to a computational pipeline that identifies IS element insertions in the microbiota. We discovered that diverse IS elements insert into the genomes of intestinal bacteria regardless of human host lifestyle. These insertions target bacterial accessory genes that aid in their adaptation to unique environmental conditions. Using IS expansion in Bacteroides, we show that IS activity leads to the insertion of "hot spots" in accessory genes. We show that IS insertions are stable and can be transferred between humans. Extreme environmental perturbations force IS elements to fall out of the microbiota, and many fail to rebound following homeostasis. Our work shows that IS elements drive bacterial genome diversification within the microbiota and establishes a framework for understanding how strain-level variation within the microbiota impacts human health.},

Here, the authors examine the impact of nutritional stress, using scurvy as a case study, on Middle and a Late/Final Jōmon populations. While an increase in the prevalence of scurvy between the time periods is apparent, no associated change in age at death was observed. The authors argue that the Late Jōmon adapted their food-sharing practices in times of ecological stress, and they highlight the need to consider morbidity and mortality together in palaeopathological assessments and the growing evidence for a non-nutritional cause in the Late Jōmon population decline. },

 abstract = {The evolution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in animals reveals that microbial inputs influence metabolism, the regulation of inflammation and the development of organs, including the brain. Inflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). Many aspects of low SES reduce exposure to the microbial inputs on which we are in a state of evolved dependence, whereas the lifestyle of wealthy citizens maintains these exposures. This partially explains the health deficit of low SES, so focussing on our evolutionary history and on environmental and lifestyle factors that distort microbial exposures might help to mitigate that deficit. But the human microbiota is complex and we have poor understanding of its functions at the microbial and mechanistic levels, and in the brain. Perhaps its composition is more flexible than the microbiota of animals that have restricted habitats and less diverse diets? These uncertainties are discussed in relation to the encouraging but frustrating results of attempts to treat psychiatric disorders by modulating the microbiota.},

 abstract = {Preserving host health and homeostasis is largely dependent on the human gut microbiome, a varied and ever-changing population of bacteria living in the gastrointestinal tract. This article aims to explore the multifaceted functions of the gut microbiome and shed light on the evolving field of research investigating the impact of herbal medicines on both the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome. Through a comprehensive overview, we aim to provide insights into the intricate relationship between herbal remedies and the gut microbiome, fostering a better understanding of their potential implications for human health.The gut microbiota is composed of trillions of microorganisms, predominantly bacteria, but also viruses, fungi, and archaea. It functions as a complex ecosystem that interacts with the host in various ways. It aids in nutrient metabolism, modulates the immune system, provides protection against pathogens, and influences host physiology. Moreover, it has been linked to a range of health outcomes, including digestion, metabolic health, and even mental well-being. Recent research has shed light on the potential of herbal medicines to modulate the gut microbiome. Herbal medicines, derived from plants and often used in traditional medicine systems, contain a diverse array of phytochemicals, which can directly or indirectly impact gut microbial composition. These phytochemicals can either act as prebiotics, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, or possess antimicrobial properties, targeting harmful pathogens. Several studies have demonstrated the effects of specific herbal medicines on the gut microbiome. For example, extracts from herbs have been shown to enhance the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while reducing potentially harmful microbes. Moreover, herbal medicines have exhibited promising antimicrobial effects against certain pathogenic bacteria. The modulation of the gut microbiome by herbal medicines has potential therapeutic implications. Research suggests herbal interventions could be harnessed to alleviate gastrointestinal disorders, support immune function, and even impact metabolic health. However, it is important to note that individual responses to herbal treatments can vary due to genetics, diet, and baseline microbiome composition. In conclusion, the gut microbiome is a critical player in maintaining human health, and its modulation by herbal medicines is a burgeoning area of research. Understanding the complex interactions between herbal compounds and gut microbiota will pave the way for innovative approaches to personalized healthcare and the development of herbal-based therapeutics aimed at promoting gut health and overall well-being.},

We share in this enthusiasm, but articulate a concern that imputing an essential politics to fermentation is not possible, and risks turning it into a fetish. Drawing on a range of work on fermentation, some of which has raised similar concerns, we outline a political zymology (zymology being the science of fermentation), channeling the concerns of political ecology to enable a critical engagement with fermentation’s diversity and avoid its fetishization. We begin by defining fermentation, situating the fermentation zeitgeist in the ongoing microbial moment, and reviewing recent scholarly work on fermentation that proposes an essential fermentation politics. We then articulate four dimensions for differentiating fermentations: ecology, microbiopolitics, political economy, and cultural politics. In conclusion, we suggest a complementary way to de-fetishize fermentation through collaboration, noting the emergence of a collaborative approach to studying fermentation across disciplines and professions in which social scientists and humanities scholars engage with the process of scientific knowledge production. We wager that this ‘collaborative zymology’ might enable new forms of doing science differently with like-minded scientists, fermenters, and other publics.},

 abstract = {Yaks are the main pillar of plateau animal husbandry and the material basis of local herdsmen's survival. The level of mineral elements in the body is closely related to the production performance of yaks. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of rumen epithelial morphology, transcriptomics and metagenomics to explore the dynamics of rumen functions, microbial colonization and functional interactions in yaks from birth to adulthood. Bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea and viruses colonized the rumen of yaks from birth to adulthood, with bacteria being the majority. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in five developmental stages, and the abundance of genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Fusobacterium</i> significantly decreased with age. Glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes were the most highly represented in five different developmental stages, followed by glycosyltransferases (GTs) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), where the proportion of genes coding for CBMs increased with age. Integrating host transcriptome and microbial metagenome revealed 30 gene modules related to age, muscle layer thickness, nipple length and width of yaks. Among these, the MEmagenta and MEturquoise were positively correlated with these phenotypic traits. Twenty-two host genes involved in transcriptional regulation related to metal ion binding (including potassium, sodium, calcium, zinc, iron) were positively correlated with a rumen bacterial cluster 1 composed of <i>Alloprevotella</i>, <i>Paludibacter</i>, <i>Arcobacter</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, etc. Therefore, these studies help us to understand the interaction between rumen host and microorganisms in yaks at different ages, and further provide a reliable theoretical basis for the development of feed and mineral element supplementation for yaks at different ages.},

In this article, I argue that its evolutionary origins are intrinsically intertwined with the incremental anatomical, cognitive, social, and technological evolution of the hominin lineage. I propose an account of the evolution of Plio-Pleistocene hominins, focusing on traits that would be later implicated in music making. Such traits can be conceived as comprising the musicality mosaic or the multifaceted foundations of musicality. I then articulate and defend an account of protomusical behaviour, drawing theoretical licence from the social brain framework of Robin Dunbar and colleagues, as well as the evolutionary framework for human culture and cooperation developed by Kim Sterelny. The role of gene-culture co-evolution and niche construction is brought to the fore in articulating the evolutionary account. Finally, I defend the view that music subsequently developed via processes of social learning and cumulative culture.},

 abstract = {Obesity, associated with the intake of a high-fat diet (HFD), and anxiety are common among those living in modern urban societies. Recent studies suggest a role of microbiome-gut-brain axis signaling, including a role for brain serotonergic systems in the relationship between HFD and anxiety. Evidence suggests the gut microbiome and the serotonergic brain system together may play an important role in this response. Here we conducted a nine-week HFD protocol in male rats, followed by an analysis of the gut microbiome diversity and community composition, brainstem serotonergic gene expression (tph2, htr1a, and slc6a4), and anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses. We show that HFD intake decreased alpha diversity and altered the community composition of the gut microbiome in association with obesity, increased brainstem tph2, htr1a and slc6a4 mRNA expression, including in the caudal part of the dorsomedial dorsal raphe nucleus (cDRD), a subregion previously associated with stress- and anxiety-related behavioral responses, and, finally, increased anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses. The HFD increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio relative to control diet, as well as higher relative abundances of Blautia, and decreases in Prevotella. We found that tph2, htr1a and slc6a4 mRNA expression were increased in subregions of the dorsal raphe nucleus in the HFD, relative to control diet. Specific bacterial taxa were associated with increased serotonergic gene expression in the cDRD. Thus, we propose that HFD-induced obesity is associated with altered microbiome-gut-serotonergic brain axis signaling, leading to increased anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses in rats.},

 abstract = {Despite their critical roles in marine ecosystems, only few studies have addressed the gut microbiome (GM) of cetaceans in a comprehensive way. Being long-living apex predators with a carnivorous diet but evolved from herbivorous ancestors, cetaceans are an ideal model for studying GM-host evolutionary drivers of symbiosis and represent a valuable proxy of overall marine ecosystem health. Here, we investigated the GM of eight different cetacean species, including both Odontocetes (toothed whales) and Mysticetes (baleen whales), by means of 16S rRNA-targeted amplicon sequencing. We collected faecal samples from free-ranging cetaceans circulating within the Pelagos Sanctuary (North-western Mediterranean Sea) and we also included publicly available cetacean gut microbiome sequences. Overall, we show a clear GM trajectory related to host phylogeny and taxonomy (i.e., phylosymbiosis), with remarkable GM variations which may reflect adaptations to different diets between baleen and toothed whales. While most samples were found to be infected by protozoan parasites of potential anthropic origin, we report that this phenomenon did not lead to severe GM dysbiosis. This study underlines the importance of both host phylogeny and diet in shaping the GM of cetaceans, highlighting the role of neutral processes as well as environmental factors in the establishment of this GM-host symbiosis. Furthermore, the presence of potentially human-derived protozoan parasites in faeces of free-ranging cetaceans emphasizes the importance of these animals as bioindicators of anthropic impact on marine ecosystems.},

 abstract = {Humans have two features rare in mammals: our locomotor muscles are dominated by fatigue-resistant fibres and we effectively dissipate through sweating the metabolic heat generated through prolonged, elevated activity. A promising evolutionary explanation of these features is the endurance pursuit (EP) hypothesis, which argues that both traits evolved to facilitate running down game by persistence. However, this hypothesis has faced two challenges: running is energetically costly and accounts of EPs among late twentieth century foragers are rare. While both observations appear to suggest that EPs would be ineffective, we use foraging theory to demonstrate that EPs can be quite efficient. We likewise analyse an ethnohistoric and ethnographic database of nearly 400 EP cases representing 272 globally distributed locations. We provide estimates for return rates of EPs and argue that these are comparable to other pre-modern hunting methods in specified contexts. EP hunting as a method of food procurement would have probably been available and attractive to Plio/Pleistocene hominins.},

 abstract = {Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis [AD]) affect children and adults globally. In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunologic, and microbial components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with Staphylococcus aureus. The secretion of virulence factors, such as toxins and proteases, by S aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and additionally disrupts the balance of an already skewed immune response. Skin commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S aureus through quorum sensing. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the skin pH; UV treatment; and use of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Furthermore, exploratory techniques such as skin microbiome transplantation, ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed. Finally, we summarize the latest findings on disease and microbiome modification through targeted immunomodulatory systemic treatments and biologics. We believe that targeting the skin microbiome should be considered a crucial component of successful AD treatment in the future.},

@article{pub.1171676804,
 abstract = {Importance: Research is beginning to elucidate the sophisticated mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface, moving from primarily animal models to human studies. Findings support the dynamic relationships between the gut microbiota as an ecosystem (microbiome) within an ecosystem (host) and its intersection with the host immune and nervous systems. Adding this to the effects on epigenetic regulation of gene expression further complicates and strengthens the response. At the heart is inflammation, which manifests in a variety of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
Observations: Generally, the research to date is limited and has focused on bacteria, likely due to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of 16s rRNA sequencing, despite its lower resolution and inability to determine functional ability/alterations. However, this omits all other microbiota including fungi, viruses, and phages, which are emerging as key members of the human microbiome. Much of the research has been done in pre-clinical models and/or in small human studies in more developed parts of the world. The relationships observed are promising but cannot be considered reliable or generalizable at this time. Specifically, causal relationships cannot be determined currently. More research has been done in Alzheimer's disease, followed by Parkinson's disease, and then little in MS. The data for MS is encouraging despite this.
Conclusions and relevance: While the research is still nascent, the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface may be a missing link, which has hampered our progress on understanding, let alone preventing, managing, or putting into remission neurodegenerative diseases. Relationships must first be established in humans, as animal models have been shown to poorly translate to complex human physiology and environments, especially when investigating the human gut microbiome and its relationships where animal models are often overly simplistic. Only then can robust research be conducted in humans and using mechanistic model systems.},

Whether this versatility was largely the result of environmentally determined processes or was instead dominated by cultural drivers, social structures, and interactions among different groups, is unclear. We develop a statistical approach that combines both archaeological and genetic data to infer the more-likely initial expansion routes in northern Eurasia and the Americas. We then quantify the main differences in past environmental conditions between the more-likely routes and other potential (less-likely) routes of expansion. We establish that, even though cultural drivers remain plausible at finer scales, the emergent migration corridors were predominantly constrained by a combination of regional environmental conditions, including the presence of a forest-grassland ecotone, changes in temperature and precipitation, and proximity to rivers.},

Here, we empirically examine the predictions of such models of positive and negative indirect reciprocity using a suite of network-structured economic games in four rural Colombian communities (Nind = 496 individuals, Nobs = 53,876 ratings/transfers). We observe that, at a dyadic-level, individuals have a strong tendency to exploit and punish others in bad standing (e.g., those perceived as selfish), and allocate resources to those in good standing (e.g., those perceived as generous). These dyadic findings scale to a more generalized, community level, where reputations for being generous are associated with receipt of allocations, and reputations for being selfish are associated with receipt of punishment. These empirical results illustrate the roles that both positive and negative reciprocity, and costly punishment, play in sustaining community-wide cooperation networks.},

Cross-linguistically, this type of reduplication typically manifests as total reduplication with a changed vowel whose quality may or may not be fixed, and when it is not fixed the vowel differs maximally from the corresponding vowel in the base. The order of the copy relative to the base can be fixed or variable, and when it is variable the order enforces a language-specific vowel contour across the two components, such as a low vowel in the first constituent and a high vowel in the second, regardless of which constituent is the base. Furthermore, all cases of ablaut have strikingly similar semantics (playfulness, onomatopoeia, movement, etc.).

 abstract = {In the writings of early travellers, ranging from Claudius Ptolemy, to the Arab travellers of the 8th century, to Marco Polo in the 13th century, the aboriginals of the Andaman Islands were labelled as ‘cannibals’, ‘most brutish’, ‘savage’, ‘dog-headed’, ‘barbarous’, etc. The islanders have been branded as man-eaters by these writers, based only on rumours. Yet the charge of cannibalism has never been proven against them. Radcliffe-Brown was of the opinion that the legend probably had its origin in the fact that the Andamanese attacked all strangers who landed on their coasts and often disposed of the bodies of slain enemies by cutting them into pieces and burning them on fires. Even as late as the 21st century, this reputation persists. As recently as 2003 David Tomory titled his travelogue Cannibal Isles – Time Travelling in the Andaman Islands. The chapter analyses the latest episode in this sequence, an event that occurred in November 2018, when the isolated tribe killed the American preacher John Allen Chau with a flurry of arrows. It shows, in the light of both historical and contemporary pieces of evidence, the perception and imaginary associated with the building of the cannibal tag of the aboriginals of the Andaman Islands.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPrebiotic fibers are non-digestible substrates that modulate the gut microbiome by promoting expansion of microbes having the genetic and physiological potential to utilize those molecules. Although several prebiotic substrates have been consistently shown to provide health benefits in human clinical trials, responder and non-responder phenotypes are often reported. These observations had led to interest in identifying, a priori, prebiotic responders and non-responders as a basis for personalized nutrition. In this study, we conducted in vitro fecal enrichments and applied shotgun metagenomics and machine learning tools to identify microbial gene signatures from adult subjects that could be used to predict prebiotic responders and non-responders.ResultsUsing short chain fatty acids as a targeted response, we identified genetic features, consisting of carbohydrate active enzymes, transcription factors and sugar transporters, from metagenomic sequencing of in vitro fermentations for three prebiotic substrates: xylooligosacharides, fructooligosacharides, and inulin. A machine learning approach was then used to select substrate-specific gene signatures as predictive features. These features were found to be predictive for XOS responders with respect to SCFA production in an in vivo trial.ConclusionsOur results confirm the bifidogenic effect of commonly used prebiotic substrates along with inter-individual microbial responses towards these substrates. We successfully trained classifiers for the prediction of prebiotic responders towards XOS and inulin with robust accuracy (≥ AUC 0.9) and demonstrated its utility in a human feeding trial. Overall, the findings from this study highlight the practical implementation of pre-intervention targeted profiling of individual microbiomes to stratify responders and non-responders.},

 abstract = {This research investigates the usage of the terms Allah, Al-Ilah, and Allahumma in the Christian-Muslim Middle Eastern context before the 9th century AD. The aim of this study is to trace the historical development and theological implications of these terms within Arabic-speaking Christian and Muslim communities. The research method employed is a literature review, focusing on historical documents and inscriptions. The findings reveal that these terms were used in both religious traditions, indicating a shared linguistic and cultural heritage. Generalising these unique terms across both religions has been a major source of misunderstanding. This discussion remains relevant, not only in the context of Christian and Islamic religious language but also in the general use of Arabic within churches that use the Arabic language today, such as the Syrian and Coptic Churches in the Middle East. This article elucidates that Arab Christian communities are considered a missing link between the Christian and Islamic worlds. The research shows that the same ritual words—Allah, Al-Ilah, and Allahumma—were used before the advent of Islam. Through these Arab Christian communities, various points of contact and examples of tolerance and understanding can be clearly developed. This study contributes to a foundational theological understanding shared between Christianity and Islam, fostering interfaith dialogue and mutual respect.},

 abstract = {Early hominin species likely had access to open, grassy habitats where periodic reliance on underground storage organs (USOs) is hypothesized to have played a crucial dietary role. As the only living graminivorous primate today, geladas (Theropithecus gelada) provide a unique perspective for understanding the energetic consequences of seasonal consumption of USOs. Geladas rely heavily on above-ground grasses throughout the year, but when grass is seasonally less available, they feed more on USOs. To assess whether USOs fit the definition of fallback foods (i.e., foods that are difficult to access, less preferred, or both), we examined how foraging effort (measured via time spent feeding and moving) and energetic status (measured via urinary C-peptide) fluctuated during seasonal dietary changes in a population of wild geladas in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia. If, indeed, USOs are fallback foods, we predicted an increase in foraging effort and a decline in energetic status during the dry season, when geladas rely more heavily on USOs. We collected behavioral and physiological data from 13 adult gelada males across a 13-month period. As expected, we found that male geladas spent more time moving during drier months. However, counter to the hypothesis that USOs are fallback foods in geladas, urinary C-peptide concentrations were significantly higher during the dry season. We suggest that USOs may represent an energy-rich food item for geladas, but it remains unclear why USOs are not consumed year-round. Future work is needed to better understand seasonal variation in the availability, nutrient content, and digestibility of USOs. However, results indicate that exploiting USOs seasonally could have been a valuable dietary strategy for the evolutionary success of early hominins.},

Work conducted half a century ago predicted Boomplaas to be a meagre plant-food location. We reassess this interpretation here by presenting updated lists of the current vegetation and foodplants growing within roughly a day’s foraging distance from the cave. By doing so, we increase the known foodplant species potentially available to Stone Age foragers by 356% and show that almost all the plant species/genera in the Boomplaas archaeobotanical assemblage still grow within a day’s range of the site. We present nutritional values for some of the plant foods, highlighting those richest in moisture, ash, protein, fat, fibre, carbohydrates and energy and suggesting that such foods may have been important staples in the dietary ecology of the Stone Age foragers who used the site. Lastly, we demonstrate that the Boomplaas Cave foodplant fitness landscape is relatively rich and varied compared to similar data from other Cape sites such as Klasies River Main Cave, Diepkloof Rock Shelter and Hollow Rock Shelter.},

 abstract = {Humans produce two forms of cognitively complex vocalizations: speech and song. It is debated whether these differ based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or if acoustical features can reliably distinguish them. We study the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies across six continents. Specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations, overlapping within categories and across societies, significantly differentiate speech from song. Machine-learning classification shows that this effect is cross-culturally robust, vocalizations being reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal features across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with the cultures classify these vocalizations using similar spectro-temporal cues as the machine learning algorithm. Finally, spectro-temporal features are better able to discriminate song from speech than a broad range of other acoustical variables, suggesting that spectro-temporal modulation—a key feature of auditory neuronal tuning—accounts for a fundamental difference between these categories.},

The author examines the pragma-semantics, phonetics, and morphology of ConKisses in 50 languages within a prototype-driven approach to categorization and concludes the following: ConKisses comply with the features associated with the prototype of a conative animal call and may therefore be regarded as the prototype’s canonical instantiations – in fact, they constitute the most canonical subset within the entire conative-animal-call category and thus a highly extra-systematic one from sentence-grammar’s perspective.},

 abstract = {The human digestive tract hosts a diverse array of microorganisms, collectively known as gut microbiota. This ecosystem is unique to each individual, evolving over a lifetime and susceptible to internal and external adaptations. The gut microbiome plays an important part in various aspects of human physiology, including nutrition, stress response, and behavior. Moreover, these microbes can either contribute to or cause a variety of diseases, impacting not only the digestive system but also distant organs. The intricate microbial community within this vital organ converses well with the host over neural, humoral, endocrine, metabolic, and immunological trails, regulating normal metabolism. Non-pathogenic microorganisms in the gut maintain a synergetic rapport with the immune system of the host, enhancing its ability to defend against pathogenic invaders. Dysbiosis, which involves an imbalanced gut microflora composition, can disturb the intricate equilibrium within the body. This imbalance has been directly associated with various human ailments, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and anxiety disorders. Understanding the connection among gut microbiota, metabolic byproducts, and the host’s susceptibility to diseases plays an important role in comprehending the onset and progression of these health conditions. Our understanding of the impact of interventions aimed at managing gut microbiota, whether beneficial or detrimental, remains largely undefined. Recent global clinical trials have precisely demonstrated the association of specific microbial species and eubiosis (a state of microbial balance) with both health and disease. This chapter offers a comprehensive exploration of gut microbiota composition and their role in promoting various diseases, highlighting the multidirectional interactions between these microbes and other organs.},

 abstract = {The gut microbiota, comprising trillions of diverse microorganisms inhabiting the intestines of animals, forms a complex and indispensable ecosystem with profound implications for the host's well-being. Its functions include contributing to developing the host's immune response, aiding in nutrient digestion, synthesizing essential compounds, acting as a barrier against pathogen invasion, and influencing the development or regression of various pathologies. The dietary habits of the host directly impact this intricate community of gut microbes. Diet influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota through alterations in gene expression, enzymatic activity, and metabolome. While the impact of diet on gut ecology is well-established, the investigation into the relationship between dietary consumption and microbial genotypic diversity has been limited. This review provides an overview of the relationship between diet and gut microbiota, emphasizing the impact of host nutrition on both short- and long-term evolution in the mammalian gut. It is evident that the evolution of the gut microbiota occurs even on short timescales through the acquisition of novel mutations, within the gut bacteria of individual hosts. Consequently, we discuss the importance of considering alterations in bacterial genomic diversity when analyzing microbiota-dependent effects on host physiology. Future investigations into the various microbiota-related traits shall greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of commensal bacterial evolutionary adaptation.},

The aim of this analytical cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence, severity, and risk factors of ETW in adolescents aged 12-15 years in the municipality of Usaquén in Bogotá, Colombia. Two calibrated examiners clinically assessed ETW using Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) Index (range: 0-3). All tooth surfaces (excluding proximal) were scored to allow estimation of the Highest (0-3) and Total BEWE (sum of Highest BEWE score per sextant: 0-18) scores per patient. Sociodemographic characteristics, ETW risk factors, and caries severity (ICDAS-epi-merged) were evaluated, and their association with the presence of ETW (indicated by a Highest BEWE score of 2-3) was examined using preliminary analyses and logistic regression models. The study sample included 454 adolescents (mean age: 13.5±1.1 years; female: 61.7%), and the prevalence of ETW was 71.6%. The majority of participants exhibited a Highest BEWE score of 3 (58.0%) and a Total BEWE score ≤8 (84.3%). The preliminary analysis showed an association between the presence of ETW and age, caries, and brushing teeth before eating (p-value < 0.05). Risk factors for ETW included always brushing teeth before eating [adjusted Prevalence Ratio (PRa) 1.31, p-value=0.014], presence of extensive carious lesions (PRa 1.23, p-value = 0.024), male gender (PRa 1.14, p-value = 0.028), and age > 14 years (PRa 1.17, p-value = 0.009). Although ETW was highly prevalent, most Colombian adolescents exhibited low Total BEWE scores. ETW was associated with frequent fruit intake, age, toothbrushing habits, caries lesions, and sex.},

We contend that landscape properties, specifically resource diversity and seasonal to inter-annual resource variability, can be used to model the specific responses of hominin groups to climate change over time, based on their awareness of these properties. Specifically, we focus on hominin technological generalisation and specialisation, meaning the extent to which there is a high degree of specificity (or fit) between final tool form and the task(s) in which the tool is deployed. In this regard, we argue that the archaeological record reveals punctuated and discontinuous specialisation during certain phases of the Early Stone Age driven by landscape predictability. These periods encourage the expression of relevant innovations and stepwise increases in technological complexity. While some of them become lost to demographic or cultural stochasticity, others end up forming the basis for a standardisation of generalised forms within the context of unexpected climatic deterioration. This is highlighted by the late Acheulean: following a period of greater generalisation in the late Early Pleistocene correlating with repeated and severe orbitally-forced periods of aridity, smaller biface forms become more common (or absent) and regional experimentation with prepared-core technology in Eastern Africa takes place in the context of a return to more humid and stable climatic conditions. The onset of more arid and variable climates associated with the emergence of the Middle Stone Age led to the continental expansion of the prepared-core technological substrate underpinning generalised assemblages. The cycle continues in the Middle Stone Age with a return to climatic stability in the Late Pleistocene and subsequent regional diversification of this techno-complex, in which hominins responded with greater toolkit specialisation in a number of different ways. In this context, we support the existence of a cyclical and non-linear relationship between environmental adaptation and cognitive evolution, as part of a wider biocultural feedback loop, which contributes to explain the evolutionary roots of our "generalist specialist" niche.},
